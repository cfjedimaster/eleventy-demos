Welcome to my blog. I've been working in software development for many years now. Mostly in ColdFusion, although recently I've been working in Java as well. I plan to use this space to share ColdFusion tips - as well as share what I'm learning with Java (and hopefully save others from the stupid mistakes I make). As always, comments are welcome, and I hope this blog becomes an informative resource for all.
