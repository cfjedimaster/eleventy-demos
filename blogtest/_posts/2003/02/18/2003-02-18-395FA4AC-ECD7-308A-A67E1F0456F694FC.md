Did you know that isDefined returns true for any CGI variable, even if it doesn't exist? For example, this will always output:

&lt;cfif isdefined("cgi.ray")&gt;<br>
	&lt;cfoutput&gt;cgi.ray=#cgi.ray#&lt;/cfoutput&gt;<br>
&lt;/cfif&gt;

What does cgi.ray evaluate to? An empty string. If you really want to check for the existence of CGI variable, either add a len(trim(...)) check, or use structKeyExists(cgi,"somekey").
