As you may know, ColdFusion will not return output to the browser until the page is completely done. This can be a problem for slow pages. You can use the CFFLUSH tag to send output to the browser prior to page completion. However, if you played with this tag, it may seem to not work well in IE. That is because IE will not display HTML until it gets 'enough' of it it to render. How much is enough? I don't know. But I've been able to fool IE by simply doing:

#repeatString(" ",200)#

This would need to be before the CFFLUSH tag of course. It won't screw up your output since browsers consider multiple spaces to be one space. You shouldn't need this if you are already outputting enough layout code or other text.
