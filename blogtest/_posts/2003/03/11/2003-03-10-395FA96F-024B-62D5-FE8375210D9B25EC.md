As you may (or may not know), CFMX introduced a new security system called roles-based security. If you haven't checked out the feature, I encourage you to take a quick look at it. Unfortunately, being a 1.0 feature, has a few 'issues' with it. Here is one I found today:

The &lt;cfloginuser&gt; tag marks a user as being logged in. From that moment onward, getAuthUser() should return the username of the user. However, it will NOT return anything until after the closing &lt;cflogin&gt; tag. So, when you first log the user in, you can't call getAuthUser(). 

Here is a sample script:

&lt;cflogout&gt;

&lt;cflogin&gt;

	&lt;cfloginuser name="foo" password="foo" roles=""&gt;
	&lt;cfoutput&gt;Test1=#getAuthUser()#&lt;p&gt;&lt;/cfoutput&gt;
	
&lt;/cflogin&gt;

&lt;cfoutput&gt;Test2=#getAuthUser()#&lt;/cfoutput&gt;

When you run this test, only the line beginning with Test2 will work correctly.
