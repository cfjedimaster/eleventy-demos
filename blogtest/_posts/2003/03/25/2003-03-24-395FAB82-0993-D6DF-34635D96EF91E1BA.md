Many people have asked for a copy of the Session Tracker I wrote for <a href="http://www.cflib.org">CFLib.org</a>. Basically, it allows you to enumerate sessions currently on the system. I also built a simple (and ugly) Flash front end for the tracker. I've uploaded a ziped copy of the code. If you use it, all I ask is that you let me know so that I can link to it. The download can be found <a href="http://www.camdenfamily.com/morpheus/downloads/sessiontracker.zip">here</a>.
