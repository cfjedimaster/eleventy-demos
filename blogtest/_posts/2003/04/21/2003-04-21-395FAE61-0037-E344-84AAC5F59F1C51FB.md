Two tags related to CFCs (and tag based UDFs) let you specify a type value: cffunction and cfarguments. The type values can be one from this list:

any<br>
array<br>
boolean<br>
date<br>
GUID<br>
numeric<br>
query<br>
string<br>
struct<br>
UUID<br>
variableName<br>

However - what happens if you pass something else? If CFMX encounters any other value, it assumes you are using the name of a CFC. For example, if you said type="person", it would assume a value of type person. 

This often confuses people. For example, I've seen people use "integer" for type, assuming the CFC will expect a number, but instead it will expect an instance of the integer cfc. So - if you forget what the valid types are, just check your docs, or your right-click-edit vtm in HomeSite+.
