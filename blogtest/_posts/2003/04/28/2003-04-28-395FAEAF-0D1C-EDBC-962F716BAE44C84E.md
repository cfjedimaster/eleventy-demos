If you define a CFC argument as being required="false", and then do not pass it in, it will, of course, return false if you do isDefined("foo") or isDefined("arguments.foo"). <i>However</i>, if you cfdump the arguments scope, you can clearly see foo (or whatever the name of your argument was) in the structure. The value is "[undefined struct value]", which to mean smells like null, but CF has no real support null.
