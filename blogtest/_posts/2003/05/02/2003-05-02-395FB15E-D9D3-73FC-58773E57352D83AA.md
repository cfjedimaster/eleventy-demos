If you are DISPLAYING the variable, use pounds:

&lt;cfoutput&gt;<br>
Hi #name#<br>
&lt;/cfoutput&gt;

If you are working the variable, don't:

&lt;cfset shortName = left(name,6)&gt;

If you are using the variable in a string, you must use pounds:

&lt;cfset fullname = "#firstname# #lastname#"&gt;

Of course, you could also write the above as:

&lt;cfset fullname = firstname & " " & lastname&gt;
