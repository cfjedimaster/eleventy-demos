I don't normally post blog entries about new tech notes on Macromedia.com, but I am going to start doing so to help spread the word - at least for CF related items.

There is a new technote located here:

<a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/coldfusion/ts/documents/dynamic_dsn_cfmx.htm">http://www.macromedia.com/support/coldfusion/ts/documents/dynamic_dsn_cfmx.htm</a>

That details how to set up dynamic datasources. However, it only works for MS Access and MS Excel type datasources.
