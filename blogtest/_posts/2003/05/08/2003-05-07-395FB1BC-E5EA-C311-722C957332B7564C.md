You can read an interesting interview with Jeremy Allaire <a href="http://www.meet-the-makers.com/conversations/allaire/1/">here</a>. Jeremy was one of the founders of Allaire and has been part of the ColdFusion community since day one. I still remember that first ColdFusion conference - held in Fort Collins, where he showed up to do the keynote in shorts and a teeshirt.
