I had an interesting thought today about DRM. The media companies were against file sharing - even though it wasn't file sharing itself that was bad - but the users who used file sharing to steal music. Now people are against DRM - yet DRM by itself is not evil - it's simply how it's used.

That being said - I think a lot of the worry over DRM is pointless. DRM is not going to stop artists from sharing their works. DRM is not going to 'kill' art. It's very simple - if you don't like the license for a piece of media - don't buy it! If enough people agree with you, the media producer will have to change it's DRM policies. If you want to buy music you can't burn on a CD, then go for it - that's your choice.
