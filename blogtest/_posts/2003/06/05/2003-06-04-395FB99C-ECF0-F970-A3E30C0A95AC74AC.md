I recently came across a few people who thought that ColdFusion Studio, the IDE of choice for many CF developers, was dead. This is not true. ColdFusion Studio is now known as HomeSite+, and comes on the CD you get when you purchase Dreamweaver MX. Now, you may not like Dreamweaver, but the cost of DWMX is less than what a new puchase of Studio 5 would have been. Some people also bring up the fact that HomeSite+ does not let you modify the environment. This is true of the <i>initial</i> release. However, a recent update corrects this, as well as some bugs, and is well worth downloading.

If you like Studio, you should defintely check out HomeSite+.
