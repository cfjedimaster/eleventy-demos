I was working on some migration scripts the past few days and was outputing a set of large structs. It occured to me that it would be nice if I could tell the dump tag to only show a few keys of the entire structure. From this desire came <a href="http://www.camdenfamily.com/morpheus/downloads/dumpf.zip">DumpF</a>.

DumpF allows you to filter output by: 

The top N rows of a query or array or the first N keys of a structure.

Only show a list of columns or struct keys.

Hide a list of columns or struct keys.
