I will be leaving tomorrow for CFUN-03, and I hope to see many of my fellow CF coders there. I'm presenting on security (web application security) and CFCs. My wife and kids are coming with me and we plan to spend a day or two in DC as well as five days back in Virginia Beach (where we just moved from). I will have little to no net access (and no, I certainly will NOT be using an Out-Of-Office thing), so if you need me, you may have to wait a while.
