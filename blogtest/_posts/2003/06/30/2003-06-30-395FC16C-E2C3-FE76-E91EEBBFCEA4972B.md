I'm back from vacation, and yes, it was pretty damn nice. After CFUN-03 (more on the later), the wife and kids and I spent some time in DC and then Virginia Beach, VA. So, the random stuff:

I finished Pattern Recognition. This book took me a while to get into, and is the first Gibson book I've read in a while (I had not read any of his post-cyberpunk books) and I am still impressed by how well he writes. Not sure what I'll read next. I have a few books piled up next to my bed, but I may read something a bit 'fluffy' like the Nanny Diaries.

I have not yet posted my CFUN-03 presentations. My plan is to get it done sometime this week. For those who did not attend, I highly encourage you to attend next year. CFUN-03 is probably the best ColdFusion conference you can attend.

Ben Forta is now using a modified version of my Blog CFC. He has made a lot of great suggestions, and my plan is to start incorporating them (the ones I agree with anyway ;). So look for a big update in the next few weeks.
