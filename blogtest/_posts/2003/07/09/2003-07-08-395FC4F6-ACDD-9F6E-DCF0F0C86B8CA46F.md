Blog 2.1 is now posted. Changes include:

1) Authenticate method is now in blog CFC where it belongs.

2) blog.ini file structure has changed. Before, there was a root section called "blog" with one value, name. This allowed you to say, the default blog is 'foo'. Now, we have a root section called default. If you do not specify a name when you call init, these values will be used. If you specify a name and do not specify one of the values, the default will be used. If you try to init("fred") and fred isn't an ini file section, you get an error.

<font color="red">Warning - This update changes the ini file structure. Be sure to carefully integrate the new changes.</font>

3) Remember Me function added to Add Comments.

4) Logout link added (for when you are logged in, of course). 

Coming Soon: Support for N blogs w/ one database.

Question: Should blog support non-db persistence? Ie, should I allow you to store your data in xml files instead of SQL Server?
