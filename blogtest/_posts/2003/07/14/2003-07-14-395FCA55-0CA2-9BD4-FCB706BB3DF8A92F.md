People requested that my blog client files be a bit more dynamic - now this is possible. Blog.cfc has two new methods, getProperty and getProperties. As you can imagine, these just return values like the blog name, etc. So, in theory, you can deploy my blog and not edit anything... except the right hand menu of course. 

Big changes are on the way, including support for multiple blogs per one dsn, and multiple blog editors per blog. RSS 2.0 will be supported. Also, I'm sure these posts kind of annoy folks, so I'm going to use a second blog just for... the blog. ;)
