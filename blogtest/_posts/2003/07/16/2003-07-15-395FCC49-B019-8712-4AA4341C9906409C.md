I ran across a bug today when I tried to make a CFC method called "notify". The error said that notify was already defined. This seemed odd since I was certain that notify wasn't already defined in the CFC.

Turns out that you can't name UDFs, or methods, with the same name as public methods in the underlying Java class hierarchy.
