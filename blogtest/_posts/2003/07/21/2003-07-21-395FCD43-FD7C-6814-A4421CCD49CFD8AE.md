This weekend I had to find a way to calculate the size (on disk) of a MS SQL Sever database. I got two solutions, both of which worked great. The first solution came from one of my <a href="http://www.mindseye.com">coworkers</a>, Dave An:

SELECT (size * 8) as filesize, filename from sysfiles

This returned the size of both the main data file and the log file. Dave made sure to mention that this assumes a default setting for the database page  size. 

Another solution was provided by Jared Riley:

&lt;CFSTOREDPROC DATASOURCE="yourdatasource" PROCEDURE="sp_helpdb" RETURNCODE="Yes"&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;CFPROCRESULT NAME="RS1"&gt;<br>
&lt;/CFSTOREDPROC&gt;

CFOUTPUT QUERY = RS1&gt;<br>
#name# #ReplaceNoCase(db_size,  " MB",  "",  "ALL")# #owner# #created#<br>
&lt;/CFOUTPUT&gt;

This returns the <i>complete</i> size of the db, i.e., the data and log file combined.
