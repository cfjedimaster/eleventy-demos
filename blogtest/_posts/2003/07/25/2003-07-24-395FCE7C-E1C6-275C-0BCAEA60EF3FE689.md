I often see people ask about ColdFusion hosts. While  I'm not using them anymore, I'd highly recommend <a href="http://www.media3.com">Media3</a>. They hosted Death Clock for a good four years and were <i>very</i> reliable. Death Clock was getting 3.5-4 million hits per month before I sold it, and performance was never a problem. (I can say they had problems in the very beginning, but this did not last long.)
