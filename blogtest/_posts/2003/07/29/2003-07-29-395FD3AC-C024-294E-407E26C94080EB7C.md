For those of you who use cell phones, do not forget that we have a <a href="wap.cfm">WAP</a> interface. It was created by Ben Forta and is part of the core zip, however it hasn't been updated to the latest version. As you know, I'm currently preparing to begin work on the next version, so I'm trying to hold off on releasing minor changes like this. I will try to get the zip updated tomorrow or later in the week though.
