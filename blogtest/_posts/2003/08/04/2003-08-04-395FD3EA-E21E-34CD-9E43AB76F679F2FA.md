For some reason, I've never been satisifed with most FTP programs. CuteFTP is great, but not free, and being the cheap guy that I am, I've always been on the lookout for a decent freeware FTP program. 

I ran across FileZilla (<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/filezilla">link</a>) a few days ago and am slowly transferring all my CuteFTP accounts to it. It's a great clone and seems to actually work quite a bit faster than CuteFTP.
