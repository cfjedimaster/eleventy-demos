By now, everyone is talking about it. ColdFusion MX 6.1 has been <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/cfusion/resourcecenter/cfmx_survey.cfm?pagename=cfmx%20updater">released</a>. I cannot stress enough how much of a cool upgrade this is. There are speed improvements, numerous bug fixes, and cool new features added. CFCs had some wonderful fixes applied as well as adding support for super(). This is a free upgrade, so if you have MX, you have no choice, upgrade now!
