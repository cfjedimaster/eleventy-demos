Ok, so Mozzila has a bug that seems to go away and come back, and for some reason, it just drives me up the wall. The bug (and I'm pretty sure I've blogged this before) involves the View Source command. In theory, View Source shows you the source of the current HTML in your browser. However, Mozilla has a bug where the browser will actually re-request the data. This has implications if your content is dynamic, or uses session/cookie checks that may have expired.

This just drives me up the wall. Give me one good reason why the browser would need to get another copy of the source when it already has one?
