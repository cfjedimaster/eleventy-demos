My wife and I left the night of the 12th to drive to New Orleans and catch a flight to DC. In DC we picked up our third child, Noah Camden. He flew in from South Korea along with two other children for expecting families. The adoption process is long and complex, but the end result is always worth the trouble. He is healthy (quite healthy actually), but being an older job (11 months), he is having some adjustment issues. That will pass in time though. I do not think I can quite accurately express my pride at this moment. His older brother and sister have already taken a liking to him. I'm sure this will last and they will never fight like other siblings do. (I'm an only child, so it's easy for me to make statements like that. ;)
