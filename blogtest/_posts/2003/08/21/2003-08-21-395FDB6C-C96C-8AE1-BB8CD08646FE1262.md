This one passed me so I thought I'd point it out. As you know, MX introduced the idea of the tag based UDFs. To do var scope declarations, you used this syntax:

&lt;cfset var foo = goo&gt;

Many people preferred to write their UDF blocks in cfscript statements, but you were not allowed to use var foo = goof inside a cfscript block inside a tag based UDF because var statements had to come after any cfargument tag and before any other cftag, include cfscript. Now with CF MX 6.1, you are allowed to use cfscript <i>and</i> var statements in your cffunction based methods/udfs. I hope that made sense. Basically, one more sought after feature was added by Macromedia!
