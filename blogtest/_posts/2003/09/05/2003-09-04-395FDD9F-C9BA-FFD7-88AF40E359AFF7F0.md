I've been a Gaiman fan for many, many years. I still remember the day I picked up my first copy of Sandman (issue 14 I believe) and I've been an addict since then. If you haven't had a chance to check out his work, I strongly urge you to take the time, and if comics are not your thing, then any of his books would be fine reading as well. Anyway, the reason for this post is that I just found out the the Endless (characters from the Sandman) are <a href="http://www.dccomics.com/features/endlessnights/index.html">returning</a>! This should be well worth your time, and if you enjoy it, you should pick up the graphic novels that cover the entire Sandman run. 

By the way, a funny/sad story about Gaiman and the Sandman. Gaiman one a World Fantasy Award (I believe) for one of his Sandman stories. The awards committe then promptly rewrote the rules so comics couldn't win again. Sad. After all the crap sci-fi/fantasy writers must get for the genre they write in - to discriminate against comics seems downright silly.
