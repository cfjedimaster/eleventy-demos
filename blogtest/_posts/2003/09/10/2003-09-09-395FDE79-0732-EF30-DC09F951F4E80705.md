A while back, I posted on cfcdev (a mailing list about CFC development, see <a href="http://www.cfczone.org">cfzone.org</a> for signup info) about having a BOF meeting at MAX on CFC development. BOF meetings are informal discussion groups held at night during the conference. 

For reasons I won't go into here, having a BOF is no longer an option. However, I'd <i>love</i> to have a meeting, face to face, with developers interested in CFC development. While there are CFC sessions at MAX, I'd like to see something more informal and open.

So, if you are interested, please add yourself to the comments list. If we have enough interest, then I'll investigate this and see if we can find a place to meet. By posting a comment, when I respond later on you will automatically be emailed.
