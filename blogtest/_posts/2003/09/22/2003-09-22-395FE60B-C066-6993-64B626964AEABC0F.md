In an <a href="http://www.camdenfamily.com/morpheus/blog/index.cfm?mode=entry&entry=31">earlier post</a>, I talked about returnType and CFCs. Specifically, I talked about how if you want to return a CFC from a CFC method, you simply use the name of the CFC in return type. What if you wanted to return a CFC, but you didn't care <i>what</i> CFC you returned? All CFCs extend one base component. You can see it in the hierarchy when you display a CFC: 

WEB-INF.cftags.component

If you set returnType equal to this value, then you can return an instance of any CFC from your method.
