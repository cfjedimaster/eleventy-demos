I'm temporarily putting HS+ aside as I test DWMX2004, but I thought I'd share a few of my favorite tools for HS+/CFS:

<a href="http://www20.pair.com/users/doozer/scripts/bas/SyncDir.bas">SyncDir</a> - This is a wonderful little script. Let's say you have a file open. By using this script, you can make the folder dialog quickly change to the location of the file. Written by Nick Bradbury.

<a href="http://www.macromedia.com/devnet/server_archive/articles/roll_your_own_hs_studio.html">Convert Special Characters</a> - Allows you to convert &lt; to &amp;lt;. The page also describes writing your own scripts.

<a href="http://www.cflib.org/tools.cfm">UDF Browse</a> - This tool lets you browse CFLib, and even insert UDF code, without having to open your browser.

Finally, a small <a href="http://www.camdenfamily.com/morpheus/downloads/now.js">script</a> I wrote myself that just inserts the date. This is a bit less useful now that HS+ 5.5 supports meta values in snippets, but I still use it to manually mark the Last Updated field of a file.
