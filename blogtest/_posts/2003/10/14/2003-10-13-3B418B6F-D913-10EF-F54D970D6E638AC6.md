A while ago I <a href="http://www.camdenfamily.com/morpheus/blog/index.cfm?mode=entry&entry=395FDE79-0732-EF30-DC09F951F4E80705">posted</a> about hosting a CFC Birds of a Feather at MAX. Unfortunately, the BOF process was closed this year so I was not able to recommend it. However, many people have expressed a desire to attend a general CFC session to talk about various issues. I wanted to remind people about my plans and to check the <a href="http://www.camdenfamily.com/morpheus/blog/index.cfm?mode=entry&entry=395FDE79-0732-EF30-DC09F951F4E80705">old link</a> as I'm going to be updating that thread in a few minutes.
