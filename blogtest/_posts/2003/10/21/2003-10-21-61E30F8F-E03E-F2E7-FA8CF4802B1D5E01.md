I saw two movies this week - 28 Days Later and Kill Bill. Kill Bill was great, but a bit gorey. I find the older I get, the less I find bucketloads of blood appealing. Outside of that, however, the movie was very, very good and well worth your money.

28 Days Later was amazing. As a horror film, it <i>really</i> stands out from the norm. It was... stylish in a way that horror films never seem to be. 

Speaking of horror, I was also a big fan of the Blair Witch Project. Sure it got <i>way</i> too much media exposure, but it really was a unique film. I don't think there was one ounce of gore in the entire movie.
