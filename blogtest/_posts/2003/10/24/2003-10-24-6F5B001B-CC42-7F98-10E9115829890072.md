As the title says, <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/drk/productinfo/product_overview/volume5/">DRK5</a> was released by Macromedia today. There are some really cool applications on this one, including a <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/drk/productinfo/product_overview/volume5/coldfusionmx.html#lighthouse_bug_tracker_application">Bug Tracker</a> written by yours truly. Also included is a new version of Pollster (which will be on this blog sometime today). DRK5 is currently only avaible to subscribes now, but will be available to everyone soon.
