A user on cf-talk reported an interesting bug last week. While talking to her, I discovered what may be her bug, or at least another bug. If a user has a password that includes a tilde (~), then the second through N hits will fail as CF is unable to decrypt the hashed value of their username, password, roles combo. 

p.s. The poll on the right hand side of the blog was broken. It should be ok now.
