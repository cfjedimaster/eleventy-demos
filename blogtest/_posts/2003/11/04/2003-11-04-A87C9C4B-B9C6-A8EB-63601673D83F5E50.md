This is just to officially let folks know that the CFC Geeks of a Feather at MAX is officially on. Well, unofficially since I wasn't able to submit an official <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/macromedia/conference/agenda/bof.html">Birds of a Feather</a>. 

The meeting time is Wednesday, 6PM-8PM. It will be in the Marriot at 75 S. West Temple. The actual room number isn't known yet. When I know it, I'll post it here, or, you can just ask at the front desk.

This meeting is for CFC developers of all skill levels and is attended mainly to be an informal discussion of CFC development and tips.
