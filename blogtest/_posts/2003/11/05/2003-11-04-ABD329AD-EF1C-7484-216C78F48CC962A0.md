Somone posted the following question on one of the lists I belong to...

"I have a string of IDs, like so: 3 91 64 37, but I'm not sure how to extract the values since the list doesn't have commas."

Don't forget that all list functions, even the cfloop tag, allow you to specify which delimiter to use when parsing the list.

In her case, all she needed to do was specify the space character as a delimiter.
