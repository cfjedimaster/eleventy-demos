Yesterday I blogged about using dynamic variables in HS+. I even told you where to find the list in the docs. Well, when I went to the docs, all I did was look at the list. Like most techies, I didn't actually <i>read</i> the page. Andy pointed out on his <a href="http://www.andyjarrett.cfdeveloper.co.uk/index.cfm?fuseaction=fuseblog.showcomments&ArticleID=20031107012311">blog</a> that you can use ANY variable. So, for example, if  I use $${% raw %}{comment}{% endraw %} in my snippet, when I try to insert it, I will be prompted to enter the value. I went back, read the docs, and discovered more. You can also do $${% raw %}{foo:x,y,z}{% endraw %}, and upon execution, you will be presented with a drop down using x,y, and z as options. Awesome!
