<a href="http://devilm.com/">Matt Liotta</a> and Barney Boisvert raised an interesting issue today on <a href="http://www.cfczone.org/listserv.cfm">cfcdev</a>. We all know, or should know, that cfc methods (and tag based udfs) take an OUTPUT attribute. This supposedly does two things: If set to true, it allows any and all output to be generated by the UDF. If set to false, it acts as if a cfsilent tag surrounded the function. In general, you should almost always use output="false". 

However, something odd happens if you leave off the output attribute. It is supposed to default to true, but that is not the case. Consider the following code:

&lt;cfset x = 1&gt;<br>
&lt;cffunction name="test"&gt;<br>
hi ray #x#<br>
&lt;/cffunction&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;cffunction name="test2" output="true"&gt;<br>
hi ray #x#<br>
&lt;/cffunction&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;cfset test()&gt;<br>
&lt;cfset test2()&gt;<br>

When test() is run, the string inside the function is output, but #x# is NOT evaluated. It acts just like normal text in a CFML page. When test2() is run, the value of x <i>is</i> evaluated. It acts as if the text were surrounded by cfoutput tags. This could lead to confusion as you may actually want to show #foo# or output an internal anchor link.
