My flight home from MAX was uneventful, a nice surprise considering the trouble I had getting up there. In general, I was very impressed with the conference. I don't always agree with the decisions Macromedia makes, but no other company seems even close to being as devoted to the web developer as Macromedia. When they get it right, boy, do they get it right.

On the way home I discovered I had accidently packed my reading material. Since I had wrapped up <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0451459083/qid=1066114258/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_1/002-3361200-1675257">Conquistador</a> on the way up (good book, a bit of a boring midsection, but good overall), I decided to pick something up for the flight home. I picked up <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0375705244/qid=1069695586/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_1/103-3254848-0227857">Books/Founding Brothers: The Revolutionary Generation</a>, and am <i>extremely</i> happy with it. I don't think I've ever read a history book that was as interesting or entertaining as this one. I cannot recommend this book enough if you have even the smallest interest in American history. 

One of the more interesting aspects of the book (although its a very minor section) is in the portion dealing with the Hamilton/Burr duel. The author briefly goes over some of the basic "rules" the duels of the time followed. This is something that I've always found interesting... "rules" when you are trying to (or at least entering into somethinat that might) kill someone. My understanding of this concept is that it arises from the desire to not inflict too much damange on your enemy, or perhaps unnecessary damage. Does anyone know if there is a book on this subject? Perhaps something that covers a wide range of history up to know (Geneva convention, etc)?
