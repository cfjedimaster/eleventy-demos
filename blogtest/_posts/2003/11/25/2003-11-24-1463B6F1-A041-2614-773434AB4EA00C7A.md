So, I've had two clients run into this bug now. When doing a getAll with CFPOP, if an email is in an unsupported locale, you get:

An exception occurred while retrieving mail. The cause of this exception was: java.io.UnsupportedEncodingException: unicode-1-1-utf-7

Some research on the <a href="http://webforums.macromedia.com/coldfusion/">ColdFusion Support Forums</a> dug up this <a href="http://webforums.macromedia.com/coldfusion/messageview.cfm?catid=3&threadid=698661&STARTPAGE=1">thread</a>, which then pointed to a <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/cf-talk@houseoffusion.com/msg149313.html">thread</a> at cf-talk that said this was a known Java bug.

So, the question is, what is the best way around it? Sure you can wrap your cfpop call with a try/catch statement, but if you are trying to download a bunch of email, it basically means you are screwed. I'm guessing I'm going to have to write code to getAll, and if this error is thrown, revert to getting one message at a time, which will be slow as heck.

Anyone else encounter this?
