Number one is <i>slowly</i> getting over his fear - he was able to ask Santa for a telescope and legos this year. Number two and number three are, well, not quite ready yet for the whole Santa thing.

By the way, I resized this picture using a handy <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/pro/downloads/powertoys.asp">Power Toy</a> from Microsoft called Image Resizer. I love being able to quickly resize an image directly from Explorer.
