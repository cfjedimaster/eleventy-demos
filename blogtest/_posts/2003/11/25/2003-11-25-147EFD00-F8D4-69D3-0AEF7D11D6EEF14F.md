<a href="http://www.gizmodo.com">Gizmodo</a> has an interesting <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com/archives/010499.php#010499">post</a> about IPod's main drawback - the battery. Apparently they only last a year and a half, and Apple charge 225(!!) for a replacement. You can get a whole new player (well, non-IPod) for that. I'm happy I decided against the IPod in favor of one from Creative (which I'll blog about as soon as it arrives).

<b>Edited</b> - So it looks like the situation was a bit overblown. You can get cheaper replacements elsewhere. See some of the comments in the link.
