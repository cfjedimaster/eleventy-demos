While it is a bit late, you should know that November is the National Adoption Awareness Month. Starting in 1990, the idea was to "focus attention on the increasing numbers of children in the child welfare system waiting to be adopted." (From <a href="http://www.adoptionmonth.com">AdoptionMonth.com</a>) 

As the father of three adopted children, I can truly attest to how wonderful the process is. It is certainly <b>not</b> an easy process, but raising children was not meant to be easy.
