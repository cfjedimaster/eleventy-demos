Well, after waiting for a few weeks, my new MP3 player (err, my FIRST MP3 player), the Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra, arrived yesterday via UPS. So far, I'm pretty darn happy. The sound quality is excellent, even with the ear buds, and it's even better with the nicer Sony headphones I had in my office. The UI is a bit tricky at first, but I think I will get used to it. I also had a few quirks transferring files, but now things seem ok. (I'm got about 60% of my 40+ gigs already transferred.) Sometime later I'll test it in the car with the radio broadcaster and see how nice it works.
