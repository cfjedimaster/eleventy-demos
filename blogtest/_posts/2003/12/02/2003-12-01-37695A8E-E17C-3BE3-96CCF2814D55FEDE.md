When it comes to copyright, I tend to believe that the copyright owner can be as nice as they want to be. This goes against most folks, but it's how I feel. However, while I believe people can be as nice/mean as they care to, sometimes I just have to shake my head.

My wife picked up a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000DF00Z/qid=1070376356/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_1/103-3254848-0227857">Harry Connick, Jr. Christmas CD</a> this past weekend. (And it's <i>very</i> good by the way.) While looking at the song list, I noticed that two companies refused to give Harry permission to print the lyrics to the song.

Can anyone explain the logic behind this? What is to stop someone from simply taking notes while the song is sung?

Again - I tend to think this is within the copyright owners rights.... but what do they think they are protecting?
