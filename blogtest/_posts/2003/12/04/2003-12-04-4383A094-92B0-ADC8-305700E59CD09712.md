In the past, I've <a href="http://www.camdenfamily.com/morpheus/blog/index.cfm?mode=entry&entry=395FDFE1-A5B7-3E8E-7EA8835F41E77788">mentioned</a> how CF will pass a structure by reference if you do something like the following:

a = structNew();<br>
b = a;

However, a coworker found something interesting. Inside a UDF, she did something like so:

var a = structNew();<br>
a.orig = "foo";<br>
application.foo = a;<br>

What was interesting was that even though 'a' was a var scoped variable, the value of application.foo still existed after the request. I did another test and discovered that even outside of a UDF, if you set an application struct to point to a variables scope struct, the "death" of the variables scope struct simply "tears off" a copy to the application scope. I can't see a real use for this, but I figured I'd share it.

<b>Updated</b> Even more interesting, if you make B point to A, ie, a is a struct, b = a, and then change the <i>type</i> of a, than CF "tears" it again. Consider:

s = structnew();<br>
s.name = "orig";<br>
b = s;<br>
s=arraynew(1);<br>
writeoutput(b.name);<br>

This will output orig and not throw an error as you might expect.
