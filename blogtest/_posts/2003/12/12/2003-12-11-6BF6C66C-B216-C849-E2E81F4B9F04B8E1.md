Interested in helping Macromedia? The following was passed out to Team Macromedia to share with the world:

We are looking to form advisory groups to better understand the needs of developers and inform future product development (not only CF). Those participating will have direct contact with us and other advisory board members and be provided with free Macromedia software. If you are interested in participating, please complete an application found at http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.asp?u=68433340144. We are looking for developers from a wide variety of backgrounds and disciplines.
