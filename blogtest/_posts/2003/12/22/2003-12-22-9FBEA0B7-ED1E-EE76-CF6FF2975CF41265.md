So, this past week our dining room finally came to an end. (The only thing not done is the window treatments.) Since we moved in we have changed the walls (including sanding the walls to prepare it for new wallpaper) and ripped out the carpet and had new floors installed. Last week the floors wrapped up and our new dining room table showed up. Here is the room as it was when we moved in:

And here is two shots of it after everything was wrapped up. (And after our Christmas party this weekend.)
