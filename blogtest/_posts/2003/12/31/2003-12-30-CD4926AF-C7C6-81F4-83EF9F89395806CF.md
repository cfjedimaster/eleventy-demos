Some random musings for the end of year...

<ul>
<li>Return of the King: I saw this on Friday. I simply cannot believe how good this film is. I also can't believe the director was able to make all three films so well. The sad fact is that most scifi/fantasy films are <i>not</i> well done. There are always exceptions, but none have come even close to the Rings trilogy. Speaking of LOTR, check out <a href="http://atomfilms.shockwave.com/af/content/lord_rhymes">this parody</a>. It is quite funny, although it reminds me again why I hate streaming media. This is a funny movie - but the break for rebuffering every 30 seconds is <i>not</i> fun. Here is a crazy idea - why not let me configure Real so it downloads like 75% of the film before letting me watch. I don't mind waiting. Really.
<li>I got a GBA SP for XMas. I have had a GBA for some time, but could never play for more than 20 minutes at a time because of the screen brightness. The GBA SP is what the GBA should have been. The rechargable battery is also pretty nice. I'm currently playing Zelda and Fire Emblem. 
<li>My number one resolution for 2004 - clear out the <a href="http://www.cflib.org">CFLib</a> queue. To be honest, I totally sucked last year as the admin for the site. With the new kid, the move, etc., I just fell behind. So, I'm going to catch up on the queue and try to stick to a two week maximum turn around for new UDFs. 
<li>My number two resolution - try to improve my reading. I used to read 3-4 books a week. With the kids, a full time job, and just live in general, I'm down to 3-4 books a year, which is horrible. I'm also going to try to get a good mix of non-fiction in with my fiction books.
