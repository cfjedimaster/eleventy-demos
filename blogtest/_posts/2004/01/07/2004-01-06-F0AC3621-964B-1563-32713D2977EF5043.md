A while ago I mentioned how I had added a new feature to <a href="http://www.cflib.org">cflib</a>. This feature allowed you to go straight to a UDF if you knew its name. This was done by using this syntax:

http://www.cflib.org/udf.cfm/NAME

While this worked ok, the links to view and download the UDF were broken. This is now fixed. Thanks go to Bert Dawson for pointing it out.

By the way, if you have any CFLib suggestions, please let me know. My queue bashing resolution is going ok so far. If I can process ten a week I should be done with the queue by mid February.
