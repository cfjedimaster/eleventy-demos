CFLib was down for a while yesterday due to a hardware failure. However, did you know that you can have a copy of the <i>entire</i> collection of UDFs? Simply go to the <a href="http://www.cflib.org/LibraryGenerator.cfm">Library Generator</a> at <a href="http://www.cflib.org">CFLib</a> and select all the UDFs. This will give you one <i>huge</i> CFM file with all the released UDFs in it. This file won't be easy to read, but it is a quick way to download the entire collection at once. I keep a copy on my laptop so that I have access when I'm disconnected. Simply refresh your copy about once a week. (Of course, you should continue to visit the site and don't forget to click on those Google ads. ;)
