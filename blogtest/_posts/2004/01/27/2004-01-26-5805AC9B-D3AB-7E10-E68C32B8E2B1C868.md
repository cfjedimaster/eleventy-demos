For those who do not like hearing about my personal life (come on now, my life is sooo exciting!), do not forget that you can select a category in the right hand menu, and then either bookmark that page, or use the RSS feed link. When viewing a category, the RSS link changes to only show the recent items in that category.

When I began this blog, I had decided I was only going to post about ColdFusion, or other development issues, but that just seemed so dull. I certainly understand that folks probably don't care, but for my family and friends, this is the best way to share   news.
