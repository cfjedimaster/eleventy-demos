So, I've been talking about the 3.0 version for at least four or five months now and I'm finally happy to say that the <a href="http://www.camdenfamily.com/morpheus/blog/blog3.zip">RC</a> is here. For those of you still running 2.x, the major new features in 3.0 are:

<ul>
<li>Support for colored code and summary/detail blog entries.
<li>Support for MySQL/MS Access along with SQL Server.
<li>30% less carbs.
<li>Page caching.
<li>"Pod" abstracted layout for right hand content.
<li>Internationalization. 
</ul>

Please download the blog <a href="http://www.camdenfamily.com/morpheus/blog/blog3.zip">here</a> and email me with any bug reports.
