I ran across an interesting CFC bug this weekend. I have a CFC method that calls a custom tag like so:

<div class="code"><FONT COLOR=MAROON>&lt;cfmodule template=<FONT COLOR=BLUE>"/#variables.root#/customtags/coapi/objectgetmultiple.cfm"</FONT><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;type=<FONT COLOR=BLUE>"__types"</FONT><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bActiveOnly=<FONT COLOR=BLUE>"false"</FONT><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;r_stObjects=<FONT COLOR=BLUE>"types"</FONT><br>
 /&gt;</FONT></div>

When I ran a sample CFM page that used this method, it ran fine, however, when I tried calling the same method as a web service, I got an error stating that foo/customtags/etc could not be found and that I needed to add a mapping for foo. Of courcse, foo already existed as mapping so it didn't make sense. 

After some digging and multiple posts, all I found was another friend who shared the same issue. It turns out that this may be a known bug in CF. When I verify it I will post here. 

Now you may ask, why am I wrapping a custom tag call inside a CFC? In this case, the custom tags make up a CMS (Element) that my company develops. I'm working on a demo that utilizes Flash to speak to the CMS so I wanted to wrap up some of the core functionality inside a CFC. 

While I <i>can</i> switch my calls to use relative paths, the entire framework depends on the use of a mapping, so this may be a problem.

As I find more I'll edit this post.
