Sorry for the late notice, but for those who celebrated, I hope you had a wonderful Mardi Gras. If all you know of Mardi Gras is what you see on Fox then you don't know the whole experience. It is certainly a lot more than getting drunk and going crazy. My family and I had a fun time catching beads and playing around at the festival. As I expected, my daughter (who is a thrill seeker) loved the rides she was able to go on. Now that is is Lent I'm back on my diet (the oh-so-wonderful carb free diet, and please, let's not discuss it here as it will become a mini-flame war ;) and have given up anything sweet. I considered giving up coffee but assumed God would not want me to go insane.
