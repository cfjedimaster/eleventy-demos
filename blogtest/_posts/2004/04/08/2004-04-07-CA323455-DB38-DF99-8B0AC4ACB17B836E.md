Yes, I'm older again. Today I turn 31. Funny, I don't feel 31, especially when most of what I asked for this year were video games. I guess I'll grow up one day. 

Macromedia MAX 2004 was announced and it's in my back yard, well, kinda. This years conference will be in New Orleans. (Please, please, don't refer to it as Nawlins.) I've already sent it in my speaker request and hopefully I will be chosen again.

Depeche Mode re-released their old boxes sets, including 2 more, for a total of 6 box sets of CD singles. The old ones (1-4) are probably the best, although at 40 bucks each it will be a while before I complete my collection. Depeche Mode is my favorite band, although I prefer their earlier albums.

BlogCFC - No development has gone on for a while, but Im going to add moblogging in the next release.
