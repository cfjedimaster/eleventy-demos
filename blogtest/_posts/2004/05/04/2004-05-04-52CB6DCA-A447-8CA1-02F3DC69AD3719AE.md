Macromedia has launched a new section for <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/community">Macromedia Community Week</a>. Check it out!

Sorry for the lack of posting. I'm still recovering from the trip to Aspen last week. My flight home was delayed by about five hours because of all the storms in the south. That by itself wasn't a big deal, but why is it that these things seem to happen on the way home - and not the way out?

I'll be in Boston in a few weeks speaking at the <a href="http://www.bostoncfug.com">CFUG</a> there. This will be the same presentation I gave at MAX, but with a bit more time hopefully we can show a few more examples.
