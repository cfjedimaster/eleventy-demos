So, I'm estatic. A while ago I <a href="http://www.camdenfamily.com/morpheus/blog/index.cfm?mode=entry&entry=CA323455-DB38-DF99-8B0AC4ACB17B836E">blogged</a> about the rerelease of the old Depeche Mode box sets (along with two completely new sets). A few days ago I discovered that Duran Duran now has a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00008NEGG/104-4617154-6769514?%5Fencoding=UTF8&coliid=IJEEGW3MSLY7U&colid=2TCL1D08EZEYE">box set</a> as well, and even better, it's their early stuff (81-85). I loved Duran Duran when I was growing up, but I never owned the singles. This collection contains a lot of b-sides I never got to hear before. If you are a fan you should defintely check it out.
