Neil Robertson-Ravo shared an interesting bug with me:

<div class="code"><FONT COLOR=MAROON>&lt;cftry&gt;</FONT><FONT COLOR=MAROON>&lt;cfcatch&gt;</FONT><FONT COLOR=MAROON>&lt;/cfcatch&gt;</FONT><FONT COLOR=MAROON>&lt;/cftry&gt;</FONT></div>

When run, this generates a error: 

(class: cftest2ecfm370320109, method: runPage signature: ()Ljava/lang/Object;) Illegal exception table range 

What makes this template interesting is that as soon as you add a line break after the first cftry, it goes away. Neil has entered a bug report for it.
