Macromedia has just published my new Devnet article,  <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/devnet/mx/coldfusion/articles/updating_legacy.html">Tips for CFMX-ifying ColdFusion 5 Applications</a>. The article discusses how an old CF5 application can benefit from the move to ColdFuaion MX. It is targetted to beginners, but any comments are welcome.

I should point out that the picture is at least three or four years old.
