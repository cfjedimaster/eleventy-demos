The zip included with my latest <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/devnet/mx/coldfusion/articles/updating_legacy.html">article</a> does not contain all the files nor the proper subdirectories. I've sent a new copy to Macromedia, and I've posted it <a href="http://www.camdenfamily.com/morpheus/downloads/migrationarticle.zip">here</a> as well.
