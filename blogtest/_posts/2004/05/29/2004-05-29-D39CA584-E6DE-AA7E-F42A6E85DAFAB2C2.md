So a few days ago I blogged about the (supposed) impending return of the draft. A post on cf-community shared a URL over at <a href="http://www.snopes.com/politics/military/draft.asp">Snopes </a> that, while not refuting the possible return of the draft, does a good job of reducing some of the alarm.

By the way, if you haven't heard of <a href="http://www.snopes.com">Snopes</a>, you should check it out. Everytime you get one of those emails that were forwarded a few million times, search for it over on Snopes to make sure it isn't a hoax.
