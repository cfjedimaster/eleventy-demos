I'm a big fan of iTunes, and I've been waiting for the chance to play around with the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/sdk/itunescomsdk.html">SDK</a>. My main goal was to see if I could talk to iTunes via CF, using the COM interface described in the SDK. So far, I'm not having any luck, but I haven't given up. However, I found some simple <a href="http://blog.andrewcarlson.org/archive/2004/05/18/239.aspx">c sharp</a> code that I've modified (along with help from a <i>much</i> more knowledgeable friend). The application, which is currently a simple console application, runs at the same time as iTunes. Everytime I change a track, the application is notified. The application then sends a request to a URL on my blog (a hidden URL of course ;) that updates the track listing you see on the right. 

If anyone wants the code, let me know. When I have more time I plan on turning the application into a tray app so it doesn't take up space in my task bar. 

I have to say - the more I look at c sharp, the more impressed I am. It is a very elegant language and for some reason it just "clicks" better in my mind than Java does.
