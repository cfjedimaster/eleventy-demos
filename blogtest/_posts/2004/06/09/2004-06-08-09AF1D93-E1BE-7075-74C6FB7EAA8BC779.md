Here is a question - why don't browsers have a mute option? Sure, I could disable Flash, but what I really want is for Flash apps to just shut the heck up. Nothing is more annoying than when a Flash file (or any multimedia extension) starts blaring techno music while iTunes itsels is blarinf techno music. 

There should be an option to simply not allow any audio to leave the browser and it should not intefere with the plugin itself.

Anyone know of a Firefox extension like this?
