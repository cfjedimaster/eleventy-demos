Tonight starts my 10 or so day vacation. The pack of us (myself, my wife, and three kids) are driving up to Tennessee for a day or two, then on towards Virginia and finally Maryland where I'll be presenting at <a href="http://www.cfconf.org/cfun-04/">CFUN-04</a>. It should be a fun trip - especially since we got an LCD tv for the car which works like a magic pill for the kids.
