I've been chosen to speak this year at MAX. So far, it looks like I'm giving the same session I gave last year, an overview of code reuse in ColdFusion. I'm also trying to push for another CFC Birds of a Feather since it was such a hit last year (even unofficial). 

I'm excited that for the first time I won't have to fly to the conference. Depending on what the special event is, I may even be able to bring out my wife and kids.
