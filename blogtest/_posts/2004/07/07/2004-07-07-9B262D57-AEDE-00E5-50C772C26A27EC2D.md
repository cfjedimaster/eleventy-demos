If you are interested in writing for CFDJ, please send an email to Jamie Matusow at jamie@sys-con.com. They are looking for folks to write articles for an upcoming issue so you need to respond soon. I'm one of the technical editors for the magazine so I could help out if you aren't sure your topic is appropriate.
