Those of you who attended MAX last year may have remembered that I held an unofficial CFC Birds of a Feather meeting. I thought it was a good idea and enjoyed having a chance to rap about CFC issues. I have suggested to the conference organizers that we have a real BOF this year on CFCs. If people agree, can you please send an email to <a href="mailto:conference@macromedia.com">conference@macromedia.com</a> and let them know? A company has already offered to sponsor an unofficial BOF, but I really want to do things the "right" way.
