Is it just me - or should I be worried when...
<ul>
<li>I know the keyboard shortcut to increase text size in Firefox.
<li>The first thing I do when opening a PDF is up the zoom.
<li>The first thing I do when opening up a Word doc is up the zoom.
<li>Sometimes I lose the cursor. Or the cursor hides from me. That must be it.
</ul>
I refuse to believe my eyes are getting weaker. It must be the Internet's fault!
