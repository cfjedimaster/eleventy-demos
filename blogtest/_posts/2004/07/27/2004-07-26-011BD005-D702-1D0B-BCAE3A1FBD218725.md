I've posted this on the <a href="http://www.camdenfamily.com/morpheus/forums">forums</a>, but users of Galleon should grab the updater I've posted <a href="http://www.camdenfamily.com/morpheus/downloads/forumsupdate.zip">here</a>. This update contains 4 fixes, 3 of which are minor, but one is pretty critical (and a dumb mistake on my part).
