Today is "off topic" day I think. Oh well. The <a href="http://batmanbegins.warnerbros.com/">trailer for Batman Begins</a> is online now and all I can say .... wow. Christian Bale is the new Batman, and I think he will do a great job. He was pretty good in Equilibrium, even though it was a standard 1984 ripoff. Although to be fair, <i>ever</i> movie/book featuring an oppresive regime seems to be compared to 1984, so we shouldn't be too critical. Also, the movie had a <i>very</i> interesting fighting style that wasn't a blatant Matrix ripoff.
