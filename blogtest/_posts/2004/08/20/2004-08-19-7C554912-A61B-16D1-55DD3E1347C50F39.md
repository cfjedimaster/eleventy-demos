This was blogged elsewhere but I had to share it. If you use Outlook, you need to try <a href="http://www.lookoutsoft.com/Lookout/download.html">Lookout</a>. Lookout is a (now) free plugin that adds new search capabilities to Outlook. It has a very nice (and google-like) search syntax and is <i>bloody</i> fast.
