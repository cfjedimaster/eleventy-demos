In an earlier <a href="http://www.camdenfamily.com/morpheus/blog/index.cfm?mode=entry&entry=55E3B19F-CC5C-5370-9175D351D4F7A842">post</a>,  I menionted the <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/coldfusion/ts/documents/loginstorage_caching.htm?pss=rss_coldfusion_19490">Tech Note</a> describing the security risk of using session-based cflogin. The recent Updater fixes this, although for some reason it was not mentioned in the release notes. I got an official confirmation of this a few minutes ago.
