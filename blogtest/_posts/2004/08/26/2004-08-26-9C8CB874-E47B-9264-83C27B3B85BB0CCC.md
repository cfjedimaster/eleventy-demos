I while ago I <a href="http://www.camdenfamily.com/morpheus/blog/index.cfm?mode=entry&entry=9C67BA69-C844-CEF8-5A8FB4A1666E280E">blogged</a> about a bug that prevented a CFC called as a web service from using cfmodule with a cfmapping. This was fixed in the updater. This is pretty nice. I make extensive use of cfmodule with cfmappings since cf_ is not really safe. Now my CFCs can reuse the custom tags the rest of my site employs.
