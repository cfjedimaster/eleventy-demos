For those who use <a href="http://www.camdenfamily.com/morpheus/forums">Galleon</a>, I've released a small update today. This update is mostly cosmetic, although it adds a feature I can't believe I forgot. When you reply to a thread, you now see the original message.

You can download the updater <a href="http://www.camdenfamily.com/morpheus/downloads/forumsupdate.zip">here</a>.
