Well, it looks like with the upcoming release of the DVDs, a whole bunch of SW goodies are being released. Star Wars Battlegrounds is sure to rock, as is the new GBA title, <a href="http://www.starwarstrilogygba.com/us/">Apprentice of the Force</a>. But I saw the best thing today when a friend sent me this <a href="http://www.fossil.com/shopping/product/detailmain.jsp?itemID=19605&itemType=PRODUCT&iMainCat=965&iSubCat=1076&iProductID=19605">link</a> to a Fossil watch with the Empire's logo on it. -drool- I've always had a weak spot for watches. I just got to find a way I can trade coding for this sweet thing!
