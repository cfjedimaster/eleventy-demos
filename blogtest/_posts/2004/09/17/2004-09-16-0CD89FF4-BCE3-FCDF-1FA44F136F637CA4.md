Looking for a history of how ColdFusion has changed? I was looking for such a thing today when <a href="http://www.buntel.com/blog/">Tim Buntel</a> of Macromedia pointed me to this <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/coldfusion/ts/documents/cfmlhistory.htm">link</a>. From here you can see the history of CF tags and functions back to version 4.01. (Unfortunately I needed even earlier history, but this should work fine for most folks.)
