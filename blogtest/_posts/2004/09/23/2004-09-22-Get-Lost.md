Ok, so forgive me, I couldn't help but use the title. Did you see The Lost last night on ABC? I have to say I was really surprised. I had heard good things about the show but I wasn't expecting to like it as much as I did, especially the opening. The engine still running was just... creepy. The "creatures" were just plain creepy. (Anyone want to take a guess as to what they are? The creator has said they are <i>not</i> dinosaurs.)

Smallville was also pretty good... although it had quite a bit of cheese to it. Seeing Clark fly was.... awesome... but seeing that Chloe wasn't really dead was just plain sad. Still though, last season was pretty strong. The show seems to go back and forth between being pretty cool and pretty cheesy, so I suppose it is worth watching.

Oh, and in case it isn't obvious from my earlier post, I <b>love</b> DVR. My wife and I watched another show so we didn't watch The Lost till 9PM. I was able to record CSI:NY (ok so far, not great) while watching The Lost at the same time. So while I watched The Lost and skipped the commercials, when it ended I was able to switch to my on-going recording of CSI:NY and skip those commercials as well. Man am I getting spoiled.
