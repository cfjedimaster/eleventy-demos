1) Fixes the layout issue in the Calendar pod that Corfield found. Doh!

2) Adds the Firefox-specific RSS link in the layout custom tag.

3) So, when you post a comment to a thread, an email is sent to everyone in the thread. It was pointed out that some folks may not like that. You can now specify in the blog.ini file if a specific email address should override the FROM on emails sent out for thread comments. If this value is blank, the FROM address of the poster will be used.

4) Someone, anyone, please help me find a better design for this blog. It is really showing it's age, and as more and more people use my Blog, I'd like to have a new color scheme (or at least a new header).
