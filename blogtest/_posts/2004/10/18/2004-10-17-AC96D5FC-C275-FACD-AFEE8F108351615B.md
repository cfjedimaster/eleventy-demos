So, exactly two months ago I <a href="http://www.camdenfamily.com/morpheus/blog/index.cfm?mode=entry&entry=73AA29FA-0FCD-78C2-4782395333C44F84">blogged</a> about <a href="http://www.freeipods.com">FreeIpods.com</a>. Exactly two months to the date - my free Ipod arrived this morning. <b>Thank you</b> to everyone who went through the trouble to sign up. I appreciate it.

I gotta say - the IPod is <i>quite</i> the sexy little thing. It "feels" extremely solid. Not that my Nomad feels flimsy per se.... but in comparison to the IPod it feels more like a toy.
