One week from today MAX will be up and running. If you <i>still</i> haven't made up your mind yet, you should really consider going. MAX is a great conference and a wonderful way to hear the latest and greatest from Macromedia. I will be giving a presentation on "Coding for Reuse", which is an introduction to the various ways you can reuse code in ColdFusion (custom tags, UDFs, CFCs). I will also be managing the CFC Birds of a Feather session.

Along with MAX, Michael and Judith Dinowitz will be running their Community Suite again. In the past, this has been a great place to decompress from the conference and just hang out. On Monday, at 2, I will be giving a presentation on custom tags. If you have heard of custom tags and just haven't had the chance to learn how to use them yet, then this session will be great for you. 

Also, as a word of warning for those of you coming from out of town. I know you are thinking that November is supposed to be a cold, or cool month. Just in case you don't check weather.com, Louisiana is not exactly cold in November. In fact, I'm running the AC now. They <i>are</i> calling for colder temperatures, but be sure to pack shorts and a tee shirt.
