The title says it all - the new DRK has been <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/drk/productinfo/product_overview/volume9/">released</a>. Once again, yours truly has an application on it. I'm proud to annouce the release of <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/drk/productinfo/product_overview/volume9/coldfusion/#pf2">Soundings</a>, a Survey application.

Soundings allows you to easily design and create surveys. You can apply security to surveys as well as generate multiple types of reports to your surveys. It is also extensible so that adding new types of questions is quick and easy.

As always, comments/bug reports are welcome. There will be a Soundings Forum set up tomorrow to report any issues.

I'd also <b>highly</b> recommend the Image component. It is extremely powerful.
