Soundings has been "in the wild" for 3 days and the first bug has been found. -sigh- Anyway, the update has been released and can be downloaded <a href="http://www.camdenfamily.com/morpheus/downloads/soundingsupdate.zip">here</a>. 

This update corrects a bug that occurs when surveys are deleted. It also does cleanup on uploaded files.
