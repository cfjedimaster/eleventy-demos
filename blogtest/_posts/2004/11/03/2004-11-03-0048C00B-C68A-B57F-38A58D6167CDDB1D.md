<b>Wednesday's Keynote</b> Well... the keynote was... long. I guess that's what I can say. I have to say I missed the "Morning Show" routine MACR did the last few years. This keynote just didn't really do much for me. Although it was nice to see Captivate and what it could do. I was a bit surprised Dreamweaver didn't get any real time over the keynotes. Anyway, they could have trimmed some of the design stuff from both days and made the demos a bit slimmer. Then again, I'm a code geek so design stuff has minimal interest. (Although again, the Flash 8 stuff was amazing.)

<b>Hal Helm's OO CF Class:</b> I don't remember the exact name of his class, but it was one of the best sessions I've seen at a conference yet.
