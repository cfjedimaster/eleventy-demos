I'm sitting in a session on CSS and so far I'm really enjoying it. I've used CSS quite a bit, but never really took the time to "formally" learn CSS. The presenter is doing a great job pointing out the little details that sometimes throws me for a loop.

Once again I'm impressed by the CSS support in Dreamweaver. Of course, not enough to actually <i>use</i> on a daily basis, but I'll certainly use it next time I'm designing a style sheet.
