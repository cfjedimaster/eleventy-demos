HomeSite+ users should check out this technote: <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/homesite/ts/documents/crash_launch_winxpsp2.htm?pss=rss_homesite_19620">HomeSite crashes when launching after Windows XP Service Pack 2 is installed</a>. I'm running HS+ and SP2 and am not seeing this, but others may want to check.
