So, if you remember <a href="http://www.camdenfamily.com/morpheus/blog/index.cfm?mode=entry&entry=146BA680-A649-E595-5029ECBF120EE215">last year's</a> visit to Santa, things didn't go to well. At least this year only one child is screaming in pure absolute terror.

Now, you may feel sorry for my youngest, but he wasn't so scared that he didn't sneak back and grab a candy cane!
