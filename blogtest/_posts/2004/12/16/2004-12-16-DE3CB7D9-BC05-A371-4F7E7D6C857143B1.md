So, first off, I apologize for the lack of technical posts lately. I've been buried in a .Net project that isn't very fun. (This is not a reflection on .Net, just the project itself.) As you may know, I've written a few articles recently on DevNet concerning RSS parsing. <a href="http://support.journurl.com/users/admin/index.cfm/mode/article/entry/502/">Roger  Benningfield</a> wrote some good criticism of my work, and since them I've been working on a more formal, cleaned up version of my RSS code. 

So today I present version 0.1 of RSS.cfc. You can find the documentation <a href="../downloads/rss.html">here</a>, and the download <a href="../downloads/rss.zip">here</a>. Right now it supports three main functions:

<ul>
<li>Identifying an RSS feed. It can tell you the type and version.
<li>Getting entries from an RSS feed.
<li>Getting "meta" info for a RSS feed. By "meta" info I just mean the top level information about the feed.
</ul>

Right now it supports RSS 0.91, 0.92, 1.0, 2.0 and Atom 0.3. What is left to do?

<ul>
<li>Generate feeds (of course)
<li>Deal with the funky timestamps
<li>Update <a href="http://www.rsswatcher.com">RSSWatcher</a> so it uses this CFC.
</ul>

As always, comments and suggestions are welcome. The code is, as always, free, but I'm more then welcome to accept bribes or other payment for enhancements.
