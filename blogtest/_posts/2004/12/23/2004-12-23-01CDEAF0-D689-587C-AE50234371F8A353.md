1) Ok, this is in the docs but it took me a while to find it. In order to do block indentation, just use the tab key (or shift-tab to reverse indent). So select your text, hit tab, and the block will indent over. Nice. 

2) So, I <b>love</b> the method display for a CFC, but found it annoying that it went away when I switched from my CFC to the template actually using it. I then noticed there was a "pin" option that would make the method display stick. Nice (again).
