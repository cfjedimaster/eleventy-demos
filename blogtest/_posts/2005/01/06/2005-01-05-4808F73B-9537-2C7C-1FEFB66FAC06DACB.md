As you know, <a href="http://www.cflib.org">CFLib</a> is a collection of open source UDFs for ColdFusion. The site has been around since ColdFusion 5, which I think makes it close to three years old now.

I'd like to thank everyone who has supported it over the years, especially those of you who purchased Macromedia products via the links there (just got a nice check a few days ago) and who clicked on the Google ads. Thank you for your support.

In 2005, I have some big things planned (including clearing the queue, yeah, I said that last year). What I would like to know is - what do you think CFLib could do better? What should we add? Is there anything I should remove?
