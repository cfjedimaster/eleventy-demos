My macrochat is now scheduled! On February 16th, I will be presenting on: <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/cfusion/event/index.cfm?event=detail&id=137271&loc=en_us">Working with Partial Page Caching in ColdFusion MX</a>. This will be an overview of my ScopeCache custom tag, as well, as a general look into handling partial page caching. Just like Oprah, I'll be giving away a free car to every person in the audience! (Note - I'm joking. Really.)
