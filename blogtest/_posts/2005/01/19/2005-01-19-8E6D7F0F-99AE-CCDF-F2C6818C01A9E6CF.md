So - a few users had reported that whenever they went to camdenfamily.com or cflib.org, they got redirected to the (host)/horde/index.php. I never saw this, so I thought it was nothing. I'm in Boston tonight, and when I tried to access cflib via the hotel's wi-fi, I got the same issue. Than five minutes later it went away. I have a support ticket open with CFXHosting (and they are normally very good about responding).

Of course, if you can read this, you probably won't have the issue. But maybe someone out there has an idea as to what is going on.
