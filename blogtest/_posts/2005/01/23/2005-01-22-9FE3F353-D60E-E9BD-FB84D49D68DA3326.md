The server issues are 100% fixed now. I had assumed the issue was temporary, or something on my end, but it ended up being a simple routing issue. Once again, I thank CFXHosting for quickly fixing this. They are hosting both this site and <a href="http://www.cflib.org">CFLib</a> so you will probably see me singing their praises quite a bit. When something does go wrong on their end - they are <i>very</i> quick to repair it. 

If you sent me email at my camdenfamily address last week - I'd suggest remailing it.
