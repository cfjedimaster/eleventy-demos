I found this cool <a href="http://www.lowmorale.co.uk/creep/">Radiohead</a> animation today on FullAsAGoog. By itself, it is a pretty cool animation, and the music is, of course, great (if you like Radiohead). 

Once again, though, I'm surprised to see a video presentation without any controls. No stop. No pause. Nothing. I <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm?mode=entry&entry=F6D73618-F80E-5A30-FF55F31F183402E9">blogged</a> about this a few weeks ago. I don't pretend to be a user interface expert. Nor do I pretend to be a designer. But doesn't it make sense to provide <i>some</i> way for your users to pause the video in case they need to step away?? This seems so brain-dead obvious I figure I must be missing something.
