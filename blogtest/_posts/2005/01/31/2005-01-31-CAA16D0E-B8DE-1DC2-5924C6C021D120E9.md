From Yahoo News: <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=578&u=/nm/20050131/pl_nm/security_guantanamo_dc_8">U.S. Judge: Guantanamo Suspects Have Rights</a>

I've been waiting for this for quite some time because I've been more then a little bit disgusted at how we are treating the prisoners there. I've always thought that it was wierd that we gave the Nazis a fair trial, but the Taliban/al-Qaeda prisoners are simply going to be locked up forever. Sorry, but that just isn't right. It reminds me of a Soviet gulag. Justice is not gained behind closed doors. Even the worst of the worst deserve a fair trial or we are no worse than the scum who attacked us on 9/11.

Luckily, the <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=519&e=3&u=/ap/students_first_amendment">future generation</a> is looking out for our civil liberties.
