So I've refrained from joining the "I've got invites" crowd, but now that Google has dropped 50 invites in my account I feel guilty... like maybe I'm not doing enough to help spread the GMail gospel. Does GMail know the kind of pressure they are putting on me?!?! Anyway, post a comment here with your email addy if you want an invite.

Come on. You know you want it. Everyone else is doing Gmail. Shouldn't you?

Signed, rcamden of Gmail. Resistence is futile.
