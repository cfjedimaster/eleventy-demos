Ok, so I <b>love</b> Application Events and the new Application.cfc. I really, really love it. That being said, there are a few "issues" you should be aware of when using it:

<b>onError:</b> When using the onError method, every single &lt;cflocation&gt; call will fire the event. Kind of a silly bug, but it didn't get found till too  late. Christian Cantrell came up with a nice work around to place inside your onError:

<div class="code"><FONT COLOR=MAROON>&lt;cfif arguments.exception.rootCause eq <FONT COLOR=BLUE>"coldfusion.runtime.AbortException"</FONT>&gt;</FONT><br>
    <FONT COLOR=MAROON>&lt;cfreturn/&gt;</FONT><br>
<FONT COLOR=MAROON>&lt;/cfif&gt;</FONT></div>

If you don't have this, your error handling will fire when you don't really want it to. 

<b>onRequest:</b> This is covered in the docs - but I know people are going to miss it. If you use onRequest, you cannot use Flash Remoting or Web Services. This is kinda silly too and I hope it gets fixed soon. I get the reasons behind it, but it should still be corrected I think. Sean came up with a nice workaround for it. If your CFCs are in a subfolder, add a Application.cfc in and use code like so:

<div class="code"><FONT COLOR=MAROON>&lt;cfcomponent name=<FONT COLOR=BLUE>"Application"</FONT> extends=<FONT COLOR=BLUE>"test.Application"</FONT>&gt;</FONT><br>
<FONT COLOR=MAROON>&lt;cfset structDelete(variables,<FONT COLOR=BLUE>"onRequest"</FONT>)/&gt;</FONT><br>
<FONT COLOR=MAROON>&lt;cfset structDelete(this,<FONT COLOR=BLUE>"onRequest"</FONT>)/&gt;</FONT><br>
<FONT COLOR=MAROON>&lt;/cfcomponent&gt;</FONT></div>
