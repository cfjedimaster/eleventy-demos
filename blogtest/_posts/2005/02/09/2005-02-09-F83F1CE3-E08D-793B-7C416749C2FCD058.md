So I'm really digging <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar/sunbird.html">Sunbird</a> as a calendar application. One of the neatest things it does is let you subscribe to a remote calendar feed. However, the feed is only in the iCal standard. Not that that is bad per se - but I don't know of any good websites that support it. Yahoo has a calendar service - but it has no syndication features at all. What I want is the ability to enter my events online, and then have access to them via Sunbird on any machine I use. Anyone know of a good (and free) calendar service that will output to iCal. If it had RSS output as well that would rock.

I'm actually contemplating on building my own. It wouldn't be that hard since I'd completely ignore the UI. I'd just have iCal and RSS output feeds.
