I've updated my ScopeCache custom tag. This was demonstrated in my <a href="http://mmchats.breezecentral.com/p71024284/">MacroChat</a> today. New additions are a simple reporting tool as well as a way to get a list of items in the cache. Outside of that - most of the changes are behind the scenes. You can download the tag via the My Tools boz on the right.
