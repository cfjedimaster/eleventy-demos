Take a gander at <a href="http://www.templetons.com/brad/copymyths.html">10 Big Myths about Copyright Explained</a>, a good article which deals with (11 actually) popular myths and copyright. My favorite is #9 - which is the defense that many people who steal music use. There seems to be a feeling that big media companies deserve to have their content ripped because they refuse to innovate. I've always found that to be unfair. These companies may be stupid - but they certainly have rights too. At the end of the day, the power is in our hands anyway. If you don't like CSS encryption on DVDs - don't buy them. If you don't like CD's with copy protection - don't buy them. Fight with your pocketbook.
