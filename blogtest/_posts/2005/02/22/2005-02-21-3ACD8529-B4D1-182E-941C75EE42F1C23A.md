This is just a general advertisement/notice/etc for <a href="http://www.cfunited.org/">CFUNITED</a>, the new name of the CFUN conference. This is the absolute best conference out there I think. I'll be speaking on two topics this year, and I promise to actually test my laptop this year. (Sorry again to those of you who had to sit through 20 minutes of me fighting my laptop last year.)
