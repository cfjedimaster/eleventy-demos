If you still aren't watching Battlestar Galactica, you are really missing out on a great sci fi show. Even better, you can now watch the first episode, without commercials, and with deleted scenes, at the official SciFi channel <a href="http://www.scifi.com/battlestar/">web site</a>. If you have already seen the first episode, they nicely let you view just the deleted scenes if you want. (Although to be honest, the scenes aren't that interesting, except for the one where the President gets a gift.)

So I point this for two reasons. One, I love BSG. Secondly, this is an incredibly good idea. I wish more companies would offer up their TV shows online. Shoot, they could probably offer it <i>with</i> commercials. This would allow them to sell ad space twice.
