CNN is reporting that <a href="http://www.newsisfree.com/iclick/i,74292351,2315,f/">Senator Ted Stevens</a> will be pushing to apply "decency standards" to cable. So, those of us who go out of our way to pay for cable somehow still need th government to watch out for us. Give me a break. Who out there is asking for the government to regulate cable broadcasts?

As a parent - I didn't like what happaned at last year's superbowl - but guess what - I don't stay up at night worrying about it. I understand how to use the ratings every TV show has to monitor what my kids watch. If HBO plays an R rated show at noon, I'm not going to let my child watch it. Let's be frank. If a parent can't handle that, they are an idiot. Obviously you can't watch your kids all the time - but if you can't trust your kids, take the TV out of their room. Or out of the house.
