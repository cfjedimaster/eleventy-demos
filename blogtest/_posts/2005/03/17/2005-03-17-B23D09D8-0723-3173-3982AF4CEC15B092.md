I got an email today from someone using BlogCFC...

<a href="http://www.foodduo.com">Foodduo.com</a>

Now <b>that</b> is a cool use of my code! Randy made quite a few changes to my code. He allows two people to post on the same topic and allowed ratings for posts as well.

Either way, awesome job, Randy!
