Minor updates:

<ul>
<li>Typo fix in layout.cfm</li>
<li>URL validation update in index.cfm</li>
<li>I added a check for BlueDragon in 3.6, but it wasn't right. BlogCFC now checks for CFMX 6.1 or BD 6.2.</li>
</ul>

As always, let me know if you find any more bugs, and don't forget the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/registry/2TCL1D08EZEYE">wishlist</a>! (Yes, I'm a greedy you know what!)
