1) This I have not been able to reproduce - and it was before my coffee - but I swear that I saw an entry with a posted date of X become Y when I clicked to edit.

2) getCategories does not respect the new "hide" logic for entries in the future. Neither does getEntry, but I think that is ok since you would need to know the UUID to get the posting. Also, an admin may want to share a blog posting with others before publishing to the public.

Anyway, I'll work on this and try to get a release today. There is another new feature I'll add to make it worth the trouble.
