A ColdFusion user pinged me today with an odd problem. Whenever he was inside a CFC method (err, his code) and he called a private CFC method, he would get an access error. I asked him how we was calling his methods, and he said:

&lt;cfset foo = this.someMethod()&gt;


The problem is the use of "this." It is not needed when calling methods in the same CFC. You can simply do:

&lt;cfset foo = someMethod()&gt;

You can also use cfinvoke if you want. 

So I'm pretty sure I posted this in the past, but I've seen it a few times recently so I hope folks don't mind the recyling.
