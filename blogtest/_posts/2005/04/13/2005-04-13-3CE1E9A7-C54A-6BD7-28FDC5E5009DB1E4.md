I just got this error message:

17 &gt;= 17

I'm not kidding. That was the message. When I find out more, I'll post the details.

<b>Edited 2 Minutes Later:</b> I turned on Robust Exception Info, and the error went away, so it must have been a fluke... but still - it was pretty funny.

<b>Edited 1 Minute Later:</b> It's back now. This time I see more information. It is happening inside a query. Here is part of the stack trace:

java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 17 &gt;= 17<br>
at java.util.Vector.elementAt(Unknown Source)<br>
at macromedia.jdbc.sqlserver.tds.TDSRequest.getColumn(Unknown Source)<br>

<b>Last Edit:</b> I think I figured it out. The query in question was a select * from foo where id  = X, where X used a query param. The use of queryparam caused CF to store the ... I think "prepared statement" is the right word. The table in question was modified though. I went to the CF Admin, selected the DSN, and set the Max Pooled Statements to 0, which fixed the problem. Although normally you wouldn't do that on a production server.
