A reader pinged me this weekend asking if it was possible to install Flex with ColdFusion. As it so happens, I had done it twice on Friday so the answer was a resounding yes. Just in case you don't know how to do it, here is the URL at Ado... err Macromedia:

<a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flex/1_5/flexforcf.html">Installing Flex on ColdFusion MX</a>

A few notes....

First - the document says that you can install Macromedia Flex on the <b>J22 version of ColdFusion MX</b>. To me - this implies the version of CFMX you run on JRun4, WebShere, whatever. It does <b>not</b> imply the standalone version. Maybe I'm just reading it wrong. Either way, it does work perfectly fine with the "normal" version of CF.

Also - and I'm not so sure I'd recommend this - but the most difficult part of the process is updating the web.xml file. However, I found that once I had updated the web.xml on machine 1, I had no problems simply copying it over the web.xml file on machine 2 (after backing it up of course). That may save you some time if you had to install it more than once.

(And may I say again - I would <i>really</i> love it if MACR would simply make the Flex installer notice CF and offer to merge it right then and there. Or maybe I'm just too lazy?)
