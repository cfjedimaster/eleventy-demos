So, I finally watched Clone Wars (with my son, who is slowly becoming a futurw SW geek), and I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised. The cartoon is actually <i>darn</i> good. In fact, the episode with Mace Windu was <b>amazing</b>, and one of the best action sequences I've seen ever. (The attack ship the droid army uses is now my favorite craft in the SW universe. It is so simple yet so cool.)

If you are a SW fan I highly recommend picking up the DVD.
