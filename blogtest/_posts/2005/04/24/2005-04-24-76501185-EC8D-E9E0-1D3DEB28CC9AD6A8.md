Arve Bersvendsen sent me a link today for an app that promises to solve my Flash delima: <a href="http://virtuelvis.com/archives/2005/04/flashmute">FlashMute</a>

I can say that on my laptop, it isn't quite working yet. I'm going to try my desktop tomorrow morning and see if it works ok there. I've also pinged the author to make sure I didn't make a simple mistake when installing.

Either way - I'm getting my hopes up!
