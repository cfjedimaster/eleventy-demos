The Advanced MACR CFMX7 App Dev book is now (or actually, very soon now) shipping. You can find more information <a href="http://www.forta.com/books/0321292693/">here</a>. Amazon still shows the book not being available, but the published date is April 25th, so I'm sure it will be available very soon now. Unlike CFWACK, I only had a minor role in this book, but I highly recommend it.
