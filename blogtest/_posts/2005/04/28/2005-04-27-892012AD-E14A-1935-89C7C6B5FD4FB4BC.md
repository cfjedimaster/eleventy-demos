So, for the life of me, I can't find a confirmation page online at Macromedia, but DRK11 has launched. On it is my latest application, Lighthouse Pro. This is a CFMX7 version of Lighthouse. It is database-based now (supporting SQL Server, MySQL, and Access), and handles security a bit better than Lighthouse. 

There will be a forum setup a bit later today if anyone needs support for it.
