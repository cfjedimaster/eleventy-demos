I'll be flying to Aspen today (I know, poor me) for a meeting with a client and will not be back until Wednesday. If you write me, please expect some delay  in me getting back to you. I'm told I'll have a net connection in the condo where we are staying, but I'm not so sure.

This is my first flight with the PSP - now I get to see how well the batteries last as I plan to play the heck out of it. (Mostly to keep my mind off the flight - I'm not scared of flying.... but I'd rather <i>not</i> be in an airplane if you get my meaning.)
