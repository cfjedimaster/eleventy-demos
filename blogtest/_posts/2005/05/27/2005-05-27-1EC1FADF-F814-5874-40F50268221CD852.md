I've updated BlogCFC with a few minor fixes. I didn't update the version number because, well, I forgot, and to be honest, it's a real minor update, but important for BlueDragon users. Anyway, here we go:

<ul>
<li>The error template wasn't working for BlueDragon. BD doesn't support the "rootcause" key in the error structure. They have noted this as a bug and it's already recorded. 
<li>BlueDragon was a bit tighter in the use of cfqueryparam under Access. This isn't a bug I believe - just something I think CFMX was loser on. Either way - it works in both now. :)
<li>layout.cfm has a cfproc directive now.
<li>mysql.sql specifies utf8 now instead of latin1
</ul>

Enjoy.
