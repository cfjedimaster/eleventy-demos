First off - the zip from this morning was missing the updated CFC. Sorry folks. Secondly, I found another oddity with queryparam under BlueDragon. The filters for day/month/year all used a queryparam using type="cf_sql_integer". This worked ok under CFMX/Access. In BD/Access, it gave me an "optional feature not implemented" error. When I switched the type to cf_sql_numeric, it worked ok in both platforms.

Anyway - the zip is updated (for real this time).

Big thanks to Rey Bango for helping me debug this!
