So - I've mentioned before (probably not here, but on various listservs) that I feel the way we are treating the detainees in Guantanomo is pretty sad. Yes - they are the enemy. Yes - they may be horrible, evil, terrorists who want to kill me and my children. But guess what - even the Nazis got a trial. Bush has these people locked up in a limbo where they can be locked away forever and simply "forgotten." Everyone deserves justice and a fair trial.

Anyway - I ran across this little gem over at CNN: <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/05/31/bush.newsconference.ap/index.html">Bush: Amnesty report 'absurd'</a>

The best line of the whole article is this quote from Bush: "Here, you're innocent until proven guilty...." He was speaking about a Russian trial, but the hypocrisy in this statement must not have occured to him.
