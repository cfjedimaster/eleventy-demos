Two days ago I <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm?mode=entry&entry=7C9827C2-F04D-709E-CBE5BF25FC1B7BF4">blogged</a> about how it was a bit hard to find the updates to CFMX 7. That's because there were only hot fixes, no real "Updater" yet (although one is on the way). Macromedia.com updated their site today and now things are a bit clearer. When you go to the main <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/downloads/updates/">updates</a> page, you will see a link to the <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/coldfusion/downloads_updates.html">CF Updates</a> page in a pod in the upper right hand corner. Nice and obvious. Now listed on that page are the hot fixes!

I'd like to take the credit for this, but sources tell me it was already in the works... but hey, I'll take the credit anyway. :)
