Today I'm releasing an important BlogCFC update. This update has 0 functionality changes, but some very important SEO changes. These changes were done by Rob Brooks-Bilson and are detailed in this <a href="http://www.brooks-bilson.com/blogs/rob/index.cfm?mode=entry&entry=A630369F-CB6D-8AE0-3AC34C783E890BC2">post</a> and in this <a href="http://www.brooks-bilson.com/blogs/rob/index.cfm?mode=entry&entry=A9A8EC7C-FA15-4364-A2D5B7BC7F9C0377">post</a>. Rob packed up his mods into the source from my zip and made it <i>extremely</i> easy for me to package up. (In fact it took about 5 minutes. Geeze Rob, you couldn't make it faster fo rme???)

So, as you know, I'm not shy about sharing my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/registry/2TCL1D08EZEYE">wish list</a> link as a way for people to thank me for my work. (Did you notice the link there??? :) This time I want to share Rob's <a href="http://amazon.com/gp/registry/9DICOFLNQAOI">wish list</a> link. The modifications he made should really help out in the indexing of BlogCFC content and I recommend everyone a) update and b) give Rob's wish list a visit.
