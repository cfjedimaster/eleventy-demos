Well, to be honest, it's not a delay. It's just Delta losing my luggage.

Again.

With my Dell XPS powerbrick.

-sigh-

I've got maybe 15 minutes before my battery is 100% dead, so this will be the last post. Luckily my coworker is on his way here and I can transfer the files to his laptop. (If you are at the conference hotel and bored, and have a power brick for a Dell, come on over. :) So if I look a bit rumpled tomorrow - more rumped then usual, blame Delta, not me. :)
