So, I'm very sorry I ended up missing the Blog BOF last night. I heard that some folks were asking abou thow well BlogCFC scales, and how easy it is to use with numerous blogs. To be honest, I don't know! I'd love some feedback if you have experience in this area. If you tried to use BlogCFC, for example, and found that it was either too difficult to use or too slow, just let me know. As you know, I'm working on the 3.8 beta (well, I will be when I return from vacation), so now is a good time to recommend things.
