Some more changes in this release:

<ul>
<li>Both the editor and comment window are a bit bigger. The form fields now stretch if you widen the window. I turned on toolbars... why?
<li><b>Spellchecking!</b> - Well, not really. But if you install the Google toolbar, you can use the "Check" button when writing posts. Can I take credit for this?
<li>SES URLs now use the day. So the format is: YYYY/MM/DD/TITLE. This means you only have a problem if you use the same title in the same day. I actually made the code support the old beta format as well, and may allow folks to change back and forth.
<li>The readme and word doc are updated.
<li>The version number is now 3.8.
<li>Various other small minor changes that are layout related.
</ul>

This is the Release Candidate version which means I think it is good to go - but I'd like to have some feedback before I make it official. You can download the software <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/blogbeta.zip">here</a>.
