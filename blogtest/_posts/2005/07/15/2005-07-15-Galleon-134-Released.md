So, after 2 "BS" posts, something relevant: Galleon 1.3.4 is released. This is a minor release, but part of a greater push to Galleon 2.0. Changes include:

<ul>
<li>There was a silly (and blank) error messsage when posting entries. I had never noticed this. Thanks to Ben Forta for pointing it out.</li>
<li>Oguz (and sorry if I typo your name) has written some significant improvements to Galleon. I'm inspecting his changes and slowly adding the ones I like. One of the changes is a link URL to each message entry. This lets you link directly to one message. I did it a bit differently then he did - but it is in there.
<li>Changed application.cfc to galleon.cfc. 
<li>A few more small changes not worth mentioning.
</ul>

Enjoy. Version 2 should be done sometime this century. You may download Galleon via the My Tools pod to the right, or by just clicking <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/downloads/forums.zip">here</a>.
