This weekend, our city held an election on whether or not we should take a loan to build a fiber optic network for the city. This was <i>strongly</i> ooposed by BellSouth and Cox (gee, I wonder why), with BellSputh threatening to close a local call center, and "polls" where the pollster told the person that if you got cable TV from the city, you may not be able to watch religious programming (which considering the area is almost the worst thing you can say), or you may not be able to watch TV on certain days like you can't water your yard every day (seriously, one poll mentioned that as a possibility).
