Ok, forgive the title, but sometimes things can be really surprising. I asked a question today on the <a href="http://lists.topica.com/lists/modelglue">Model-Glue list</a> about the XML file used to configure MG apps. 

One of the things I had noticed while editing my config file was that I had to repeat my application name multiple times. I asked if there was someway we could abstract that. Turns out - XML has something already built in - XML Entities. Wayne Graham sent a very nice solution in to the list and has blogged about it <a href="http://swem.wm.edu/blogs/waynegraham/index.cfm/2005/7/21/model-glue-entities">here</a>.

Even if you do not use MG, I highly recommend reading his blog entry.
