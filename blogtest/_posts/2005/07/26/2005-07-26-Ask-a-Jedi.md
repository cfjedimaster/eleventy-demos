After about two weeks of almost constant blog postings - I found myself with a delimma today. I couldn't think of one thing to write about. So - here's an idea. If you have any questions(*), post them here, and I'll write up the answers as blog postings.

* Now - let's be grown ups here. A "good" question is not you asking me to debug your code. I'm talking about generic style questions like:

<ul>
<li>Why do you use CFCs in your blog code?
<li>I want to use CF's caching feature for queries, but how do I clear the cache?
<li>What is the best way to learn ColdFusion?
<li>How do estimate the airspeed velocity of an unladen (African) swollow?
</ul>
