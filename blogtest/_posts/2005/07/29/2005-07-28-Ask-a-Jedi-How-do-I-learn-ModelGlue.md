<blockquote>
Hi Ray, what's the best way to learn Model Glue? I do have the manuals and stuff like that, but can you start to write some stuff about that? Cuz the documentation is very poor until now.
</blockquote>

As readers to my blog know, I've been really excited lately about <a href="http://www.model-glue">Model-Glue</a>. I find it a bit more "lite" than Mach-II, which is not to say Mach-II is bad. For some reason, I'm just "grooving" on Model-Glue more than I grooved on Mach-II. 

So that being said, I do not agree that the documentation is poor. To be precise - there isn't documentation. There <i>is</i> a <a href="http://www.model-glue.com/quickstart/index.html">Quick Start</a> guide, which I think is wonderful. It is one of the best guides I've ever read. (<b>Ack! In my first version of this post, I said I had written the quick start. That is absolutely NOT true and I apologize for the mistake!</b>) That being said, I wouldn't call it "Documentation" per se. I would like to see something more formal come along. (Hey Joe, can I help with that?) Along with the Quick Start, there is also an excellent <a href="http://lists.topica.com/lists/modelglue">listserver</a>. I know it is excellent because I've asked many stupid questions there and have gotten good answers. :)

Last but not least - the absolute best way to learn Model-Glue, or ColdFusion, or C++, or Assembly (lord forbid), is to start an application. For me - it is the rewrite of <a href="http://www.cflib.org">CFLib.org</a>. I'd suggest finding a project, preferably something small and simple, and simply start writing.
