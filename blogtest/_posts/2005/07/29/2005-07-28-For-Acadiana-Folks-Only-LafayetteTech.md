So, I don't think I have more than 2 or 3 people who read my blog from the local area, but just in case there are more, I thought I'd mention the listserver that I created recently. <a href="http://www.acadianammug.org/index.cfm?mode=entry&entry=4EF64DFA-B6BC-A59F-0CF64A4E170EEE9B">LafayetteTech</a> is a listserver for the Acadiana area to help foster discussion among the local tech/IT community. It isn't just for web development, but tech in general. There are some pretty exciting things happening locally, in fact,  Slashdot recently covered our election concerninig <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2005/7/18/Lafayette-got-Slashdotted">fiber to the home</a>. I wanted to help start a discussion for people in my area since there really isn't (afaik) a cohesive group or discussion area for technology in Acadiana.
