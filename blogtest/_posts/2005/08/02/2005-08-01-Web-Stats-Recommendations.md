Can anyone recommend a good program for analyzing web stats? Let me tell you what I'm looking for first:

1) Simple setup. I just spent 30 minutes trying to get awstats working, and it was a royal pain in the rear. I've used Analog as well - and while Analog actually worked for me, it is still a pain to configure. (If someone can recommend a GUI editor for Analog config files, that would be ok.)

2) Caching. Basically, once it scans the log file for January 1, 2005, it should remember that it cached it.

3) Reverse DNS lookup.

4) Price: I'm looking for free, but I don't mind buying a program if it is worth the money. Although I'm not in the market for an "Enterprise" type solution. I mean something less than a hundred dollars or so.
