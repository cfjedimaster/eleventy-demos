A minor update. Here are the changes:

<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug in the admin related to the changes I made in 1.3.5.
<li>Reworked the message display a bit, just the area beneath the message text. I used to show the full URL of the direct link, now I just say "Link". I also added Top/Bottom controls.
<li>Meta tags now show up in the page template, based on the page title.
<li>When a user posts, their cache is refreshed.
</ul>
