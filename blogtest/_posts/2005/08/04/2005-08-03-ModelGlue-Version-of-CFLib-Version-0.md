As I mentioned before, I wanted to share my progress with the Model-Glue version of <a href="http://www.cflib.org">CFLib</a> as I made progress. Last night I uploaded the files, set up the server, and now it is running here:

<a href="http://mg.cflib.org">http://mg.cflib.org</a>

Right now it is <i>very</i> bare-bones. You can browse libraries, and view a library, but not much else. It will also be a bit slow as I didn't turn off the auto-reload setting yet. Either way, check it out, and I promised (threatened), I'm going to share the code as well. <b>Warning:</b> I'm a Model-Glue newbie. I'm sure next year I'll look at this code and shudder. But for now, if you want to see it, you may download it <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/downloads/beta.cflib.org.zip">here</a>.
