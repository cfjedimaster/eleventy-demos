If you read my earlier <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2005/8/5/One-of-Those-Days--and-Another-Dell-Horror-Story">entry</a>, you know I'm fighting a war against Dell today. I spent another hour and a half on the phone with them, and got pushed into the wrong queue for the fifth time. I demanded a manager again. Turns out - one of the major call centers for laptop support had a failuare today.

So I asked the manager why I wasn't told that. Turns out - there are other laptop centers - and I just got "unlucky."

Nice.

So - he took my number and promised I would get a call. He also confirmed that the new battery I got should have added at least an hour to my uptime. Of course, if the problem is with the laptop, it is already out of warranty (I only got a year). I tell ya - I'm this close to buying a Powerbook and forgetting about it.
