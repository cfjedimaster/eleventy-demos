So I hope people are getting too bored yet, but hey, this <i>is</i> a personal blog. Last night I grabbed my laptop, did some work, and noticed something odd. When I went to check how little time I had left, Windows told me I still had an hour and fourty-five minutes left. I had to look twice because I hadn't seen that much available in a long. I thought perhaps it was wrong, but thirty or so minutes later and I was still well over an hour of battery life remaining. So this makes me wonder - did the battery just take time to warm up? I'm still mad as heck at how I was bounced around in the queues yesterday, but if the battery continues to work like this, I'll probably forget about it.
