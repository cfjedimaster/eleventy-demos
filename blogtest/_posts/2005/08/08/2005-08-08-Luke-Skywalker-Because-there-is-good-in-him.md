As Luke said,

<blockquote>
Because, there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I have to try. 
</blockquote>

Today I made my order for the Mac Mini. (Went with the one in the middle.) By this time next week I should have it up and running with a KVM (hopefully).
