Well, not "new" per se, but new to me. I've recently fallen in love with a band called <a href="http://www.saintetienne.com/mainmenu.html">Saint Etienne</a>. They seem to be a mix of pop, funk, and just plain unique sounds. I especially like "Only Love Can Break Your Heart" and "Like a Motorway." If you are looking for something different, check them out. (I'd recommend: <b>Smash The System Singles 1990-94</b> for a good sampling.)
