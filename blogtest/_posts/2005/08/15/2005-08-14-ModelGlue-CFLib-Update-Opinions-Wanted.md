I've updated the Model-Glue version of CFLib again. You can find it here:

<a href="http://mg.cflib.org">http://mg.cflib.org</a>

What's the update this time? You can actually view a resource now. (Also, I'm recording views with a new stats pod.) I'm looking for feedback. Since the new CFLib will support multiple types of resources, I've simplified the layout a bit of the resource display. I think this looks fine, but I'm concerned about the code display. It is "pretty", but because it isn't a text area, there is no way to "Select All / Copy". I could simply add some javaScript code for that. Any other thoughts on how it looks? You can download resources now. (But not whole libraries.)

As before, the code can be downloaded <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/downloads/beta.cflib.org.zip">here</a>. Any comments on the Model-Glue code are also welcome.
