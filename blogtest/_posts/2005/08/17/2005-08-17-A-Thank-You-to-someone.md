Someone nice out there got me <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0596007124/qid=1124318181/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-9095540-0262448?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">Head First Design Patterns</a> from my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/registry/2TCL1D08EZEYE">wishlist</a>. Unfortunately I can't tell <i>who</i> sent it.... so thank you, whoever you are. :)

If you haven't checked the book out yet, you should. I started reading it when a coworker had it at CFUNITED, and I loved it (well, how it started at least).
