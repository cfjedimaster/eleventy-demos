For those who attended my presentation today, here is the promised <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/downloads/verity_macro.zip">download</a>. This contains the Powerpoint plus all the code files, including some code not showed in the presenation. Enjoy.

A big thank you to <a href="http://tjordahl.blogspot.com/">Tom Jordhal</a> of Macromedia for helping field questions and covering what I didn't know. (And a lot of what I <i>do</i> know about Verity in ColdFusion comes from my constant pestering of him. ;)
