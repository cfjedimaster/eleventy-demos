So, yesterday, an errant program accidently triggered the CFLib weekly email to go out early. It also seemed to trigger it a few times. Since I have over four thousand subscribers, this created a huge glut on my mail server. I didn't realize anything was wrong until my wife noticed she hadn't gotten her daily emails.

I'm in the process now of trying to clean out the outbound queue. 

It is possible you may get one or more additional CFLib emails.

I <i>deeply</i> apologize. I know exactly how it happaned and I'm pretty darn sure it won't happen again. 

CFLib has run for many years now and the email service has been, at least in my opinion, pretty darn stable. I hope folks will understand this was just a one-time glitch. 

Some people have demanded to be removed. I'm sad to see you go, but if you really do want to be removed, simply email me at: ray@camdenfamily.com. I'll remove you as soon as possible.
