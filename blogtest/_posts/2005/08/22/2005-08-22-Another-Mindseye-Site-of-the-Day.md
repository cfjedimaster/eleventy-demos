For the second time, a <a href="http://www.mindseye.com">Mindseye</a> web site has won Macromedia's <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/cfusion/showcase/index.cfm">Site of the Day</a> Award. The site is the <a href="http://www.footjoy.com/gfII">GF:II Microsoft</a>, a subsite of the <a href="http://www.footjoy.com">Footjoy.com</a> site, a long-time Mindseye client. Just so it's clear, I had nothing to do with this site - but I'm proud of my company's accomplishment!
