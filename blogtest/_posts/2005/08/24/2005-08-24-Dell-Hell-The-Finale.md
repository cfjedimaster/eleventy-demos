So it occured to me that I never got around to wrapping up the thread I started with <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2005/8/5/My-Day-In-HDell">My Day in H(D)ell</a>, <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2005/8/6/Dell-Update-Number-2432940">Dell Update Number 2,432,9400</a>, and <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2005/8/12/Dell-Update-Inifinity">Dell Update Infinity</a>.

It appears as if, for now anway, Dell <a href="http://publications.mediapost.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=Articles.showArticleHomePage&art_aid=33396">cares</a> about bloggers. Since I'm sure Dell is carefully scanning my blog, I thought I'd give a resolution to my battery issue.

First off - I never did get a call from Dell. I had been promised not one, but two calls. This wouldn't bug me so much if I hadn't spent more then 5 hours on the phone with them. 

The battery <i>is</i> working great now - but mainly because I stopped using Remote Desktop Connection. Apparently it was using the heck out of the WiFi and draining the battery. Now I can get 2+ hours of usage which makes me quite happy. In fact, I used to work on my laptop every night until the battery died out. Now I find myself needing to put the laptop away or I'll work too much. (I know, I know, I should be focused on BlogCFC 4.0 - what can I say - I have a lift.)

So all in all - I'm happy I got the new battery - I'm happy I found a way to make it last a long time - but I'm very, very disappointed with Dell and I'm not sure if I'll buy with them again.
