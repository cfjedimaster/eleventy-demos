Tell me if you've done this before....

You visit a site. You find it has an error. You hunt down the method to contact the site (not always an easy task). You write an email explaining the issue. 

And then nothing. No response. No thank you. No response at all, except for perhaps a form letter response.

About a month or so ago I found a bug on a few local sites. After emailing the owner, the email bounced back to me. So I sent an email to (practically) every other email address I found on the site - and while the bug was fixed, I never heard back.

This wouldn't bug me as much if it didn't happen so often.

Maybe I should stop emailing folks and simply <i>blog</i> the errors when I find them.... or would that be mean??
