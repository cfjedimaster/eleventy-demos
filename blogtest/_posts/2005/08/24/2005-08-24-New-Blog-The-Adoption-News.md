As readers of this blog know, I've adopted three beautiful, wonderful, and of course perfect (ahem) children from South Korea. The adoption process is a wonderful, and trying process. I try to keep up to date on the latest adoption news even though our adoptions are complete (for now). 

I haven't found a good resource to aggregate various adoption-related news items out there, so I figured, why not make my own. Check it out here at <a href="http://www.theadoptionnews.com">The Adoption News</a>.

It is running BlogCFC and Galleon. Also the picture from purchased from <a href="http://www.istockphoto.com">iStockPhoto.com</a>, which despire my earlier <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2005/8/24/Vile-Forms">complaints</a>, is a very nice and useful service.
