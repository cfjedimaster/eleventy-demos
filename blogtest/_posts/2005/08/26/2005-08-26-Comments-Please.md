As you may have noticed, hopefully noticed that is, I've been doing quite a bit of posting lately. I've been doing a lot of reading on blogging and professional blogging. Part of it is to increase the revenue my sites gain. (I swear it's not because I'm greedy, but when my free time hobbies earn money, it makes me a heck of a lot more inclined to share. ;) Part of it is that I just love writing. One of the new features of this blog, the "Ask a Jedi" series, is working rather well I think, although I don't always have the answer. (Who does? More on that later.)

What else would folks like to see? I've considered some ColdFusion 101 type posts, like, how to use structures, but I always figured my audience were not beginner ColdFusion developers. Would there be interest in that? What else?

Anything I should be talking <i>less</i> about? (Don't say my personal stuff though, my blog will always have personal content. :)

So, as I said above, I can't always answer the Ask a Jedi stuff. There are great resources out there like CF-Talk and Easy-CFM. But would folks like to use a forum here? If so, I could always add a ColdFusion forum to my <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/forums">forums</a>.
