I will be doing another Macrochat on September 14th. The title, which isn't great, I know, is <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/cfusion/event/index.cfm?event=detail&id=288085&loc=en_us">Validating Input Parameters</a>. What I wanted to call it was the "Sneaky Bastard" Macrochat, but for some reason that didn't fly.
