If you are one of the 19 folks subscribed to this blog (thank you) or are subscribed to another BlogCFC installation, you may have noticed that when a post goes out with lots of HTML (like a post containing <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2005/8/31/ColdFusion-101-Building-a-Calendar">colored code</a>), the email is a big ugly. How much does this bug you? I could just send HTML email. It wouldn't be too obnoxious since the HTML would just be code. I could also write a method to revert the HTML to something nicer in plain text. I'd like to do a solution that would go into the core code for BlogCFC, so thoughts would be appreciated.
