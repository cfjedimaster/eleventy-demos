First off, I'm happy to welcome visitors today from the <a href="http://www.blogherald.com/">Blog Herald</a>. My blog was picked as one of the <a href="http://www.blogherald.com/2005/09/02/100-blogs-in-100-days-day-12-jedi-master/">100 blogs in 100 days</a> campaign. 

Secondly, the response to my Ask a Jedi pod has been a bit - overwhelming. I want to thank everyone who has sent in a question. You may notice I'm a bit low on posts this week. The reason is that yesterday was Launch Day for a large site that I've been working on. (I'll blog about it more when it actually goes live later on today.) Anyway, I am getting your emails. I am saving them, and I hope to post some responses up today.
