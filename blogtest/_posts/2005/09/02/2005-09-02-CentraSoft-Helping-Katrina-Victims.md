<a href="http://centrasoft.com">CentraSoft</a>, the makers of the CFMX Exam Buster, are donating all of their proceeds to help the victims of hurricane Katrina. Here are the details:

CentraSoft is donating all proceeds from the sale of CFMX Exam Buster from
12:01am Friday September 2nd, 2005 through 11:59pm Friday September 9th,
2005 to the American Red Cross (for Hurricane Katrina victims).
That's right, you can purchase CFMX Exam Buster to help you study for the
Macromedia ColdFusion MX 7.0 certification exam, and know that your purchase
is being donated to a fantastic charity and helping people that are in dire
need.

100% of the proceeds from sales during the above mentioned time period will
be donated to the American Red Cross. After September 9th, I will post the
amount which has been donated to help the Hurricane Katrina victims.

This is an opportunity for you to get an excellent product and help a worthy
cause at the same time.
