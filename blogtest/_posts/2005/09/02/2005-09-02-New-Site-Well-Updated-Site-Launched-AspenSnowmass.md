The 6th version of <a href="http://www.aspensnowmass.com">Aspen/Snowmass</a> launched today. The design has been updated with lots of cool Flash work (none of which I can take credit for - except for the back end), new search (and yes, it uses Verity), and all kinds of goodies.

This site won the Macromedia Site of the Day a few months back. I have to say that I think this is the greatest version yet, although I'm probably just a tiny bit biased.
