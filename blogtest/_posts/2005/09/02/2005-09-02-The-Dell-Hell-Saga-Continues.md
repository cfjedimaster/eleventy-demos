So, who wants to take a guess? Based on my <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2005/8/26/More-Dell-Hell">last Dell Hell</a> experience, who here thinks Dell actually called me this week? Of course, the lines <i>were</i> about 90% off Monday through Wednesday, but the "promised" email from the manager I spoke to never came either. I guess I'll just exchange the laptop battery for a new one. Oh, and I guess I'll never buy Dell again.
