Mark discovered a <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/forums/messages.cfm?threadid=373AE0C6-A2B9-BFA4-29487224203D0E97#top">bug</a> in how BlogCFC handles subscribers when more than one blog exists in a database. Follow the link for more information. If this is a problem for folks, I can issue a patch. I'd rather wait and release it in 4.0, but that may be a month or so away. (Just started a new DRK project.) So - if folks here are affected by this bug and want a fix quicker, please post and I'll get on it.
