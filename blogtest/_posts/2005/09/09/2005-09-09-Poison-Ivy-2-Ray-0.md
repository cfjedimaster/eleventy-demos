So, I've already <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2005/9/6/Plants-1-Raymond-0-and-more-musings-on-Dell-Hell">mentioned</a> my run-in with poison ivy. Since I'm slowly turning into <a href="http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/gallery/2004/05/26/timzaccheo.jpg">Sloth from Goonies</a>, I thought it might be time to get professional help. My eye is swollen; I've got the ivy on both legs and both arms, and my right hand is... scary. I'm not joking. Like my kids run from it.

So last night my wife dropped me off at a "Doc in the Box" and I got both a shot and some nice pills. So far... things <i>maybe</i> seem a bit better. My eye isn't as "Sloth-like" anymore, but the rest of the rashes/blisters look bad, if maybe a bit dimmer. 

So, whats the moral of the story? I'll never, ever, touch anything again that is even close to being green and leafy. Period. Nature BAD! Inside GOOD!
