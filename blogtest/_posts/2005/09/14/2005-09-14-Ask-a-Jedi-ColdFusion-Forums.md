I've been running the "Ask a Jedi" series for a few weeks now, and I think it is working great. A while back I <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2005/8/26/Comments-Please">asked </a> about ways I could improve the site/blog/everything a bit more. One of the suggestions was a forum. I think this could be nice as I don't always have time to answer folks, and, since there is a small community of readers growing here, maybe we can help each other? There <b>are</b> other forums out there, and excellent listservers like cf-talk, but, if folks <i>do</i> want to discuss things here in a more formal manner (comments are nice, but get a bit long winded), I've added a new <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/forums/threads.cfm?forumid=55295D16-0237-9D67-543513A1C4C22E25">conference</a> to my Galleon install. It is nice and vague "ColdFusion / General Questions." If folks use it, and traffic is signficant, I'll look into subdividing things a bit more. Thoughts?
