My Macrochat was recorded and may be watched <a href="http://mmchats.breezecentral.com/p49809263/">here</a>. Enjoy listening to my silky-smooth voice as I detail the wonders of input validation and ColdFusion. 

You can download the code and PowerPoint <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/downloads/input_preso.zip">here</a>. Note - the PowerPoint was reworked from an older presentation, so you will notice some old notes in there. Just ignore them please. :)

You will also notice that I didn't get to the end of my presentation. The ending was going to discuss simple error handling in ColdFusion, something far too few people do. Since I didn't cover it on the Macrochat, I'll plan a blog entry on it later this week.
