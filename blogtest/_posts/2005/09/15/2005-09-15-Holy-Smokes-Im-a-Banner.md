<a href="http://www.macromedia.com/macromedia/events/max"><img src="https://static.raymondcamden.com/images/maxray.jpg" align="left" border="0"></a>So I was reading <a href="http://slashdot.org">Slashdot.org</a> last night when I noticed something. They had a banner ad for MAX - the same capaign I was a part of. (Yes, I know. I <i>tried</i> to tell Macromedia how scary I look. They didn't listen.) I pinged my contact, and yes, it is true. The Jedi's hairy mug is in both "normal" banners and the skyscraper type ad you see to your left. 

I'm not quite sure what to think. Part of me thinks this is so cool. The other part of me thinks... this is soooo incredibly cool. All I need now is a Times Square placement!
