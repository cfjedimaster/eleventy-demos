I got an IM from <a href="http://www.web-relevant.com/blogs/cfobjective/index.cfm">Jared</a> a few days ago and I'm just now getting around to blogging about it. Jared was able to score a small contract job doing a BlogCFC upgrade for <a href="http://www.flir.com/">FLIR Systems</a>. Flir builds thermal imaging and stabilized camera systems for things like helicoptors and search and resue operations. I believe the blog is just being used internally at the moment.

Either way - while I'm not a big "Open Source" guy, and I don't think it is a sin to sell code as some do, it is kind of cool to see someone actually earning money off of free software.

So, um, Jared, I'll be getting my cut when?

<b>Edited:</b> I was wrong - the blog is available outside: <a href="http://www.flirblog.com/">http://www.flirblog.com/</a>
