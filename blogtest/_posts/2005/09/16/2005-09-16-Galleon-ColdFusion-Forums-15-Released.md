Another week, another new release. Sorry BlogCFC folks, I've been all tied up in Forums lately, I'll return to BlogCFC 4.0 (and the <a href="http://mg.cflib.org">Model-Glue CFLib</a>) one day. So what is new in the 1.5 release?

<ul>
<li>Sorting. You can now sort the conferences, forums, and threads. Note - sticky threads always stay on top, period.
<li>Last post. You can jump to the last post from a conference, forum, or thread. Big thanks go to Shlomy Gantz for the SQL.
<li>Fixed a bug with pagination. 
<li>Fixed a bug in mysql install script.
<li>Added an error template. It will try to email the admin on error.
</ul>
