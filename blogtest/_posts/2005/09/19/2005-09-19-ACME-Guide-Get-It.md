Others have blogged it, but I wanted to help spread the word. The <a href="http://www.stephencollins.org/acme/">ACME Guide</a> is one of the best books (well, 60 pages, so it is a short book) I have <i>ever</i> seen in terms of web development. I think these guys are absolute <b>fools</b> for giving this away, so get it before they wise up! This book covers <i>everything</i> you need to know to get a darn strong web development up and running on a box. Any new web developer (well, CF developer) that my company hires will be required to read this. Sorry to gush so much, but I really think it is worthy of the praise.
