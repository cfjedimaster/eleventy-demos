Gee, wasn't I warning about some down time just a few weeks ago? Seems like, once again, we have a small storm headed our way. Lafayette will be on the edge, but on the bad edge. While I'm not worried too much, I am concerned about losing power. Right before my wife and I moved to Louisiana, a category one hurricane named Lilly came through. Our friends a few blocks away lost power for <b>five</b> days. I love this town, but the power grid (and phone grid, which is <b>still</b> suffering from Katrina) is a bit like a third-world country.

So - that being said - if you see a dramatic lack of posts and I don't reply to email, I'm not dead, just sweating to death in what Louisiana calls Fall.
