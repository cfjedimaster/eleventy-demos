We had a calm period for a short while, but things are warming up again. No downed trees, just a huge bunch of branches all over the place. We still have power, which shocks the heck out of me. The local power company said that they were surprised too. They also said they aren't going out anymore, so if we do lose power, it won't return till tomorrow. Eye is scheduled to hit land now at 1AM.
