Every now and then someone emails me wondering if I know someone available for a position. Most CF people I know are pretty occupied. In order to help folks out, I've added two new forums to my <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/forums/forums.cfm?conferenceid=5527DFBD-CC08-F498-C903DAFC2817BB56">ColdFusion</a> conference. There is one forum for job seekers, and one forum for people with jobs to offer. Again - the mailing lists over at HouseOfFusion have this covered, but I wanted to offer another way for folks to find employment.
