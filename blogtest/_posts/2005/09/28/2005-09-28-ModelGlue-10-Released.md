Folks, I cannot stress enough the amount of respect and admiration I have for the <a href="http://www.model-glue.com">Model-Glue</a> framework. I was surprised and very excited to hear that <a href="http://www.model-glue.com/index.cfm?mode=entry&entry=9D495E59-E081-2BAC-693525110654574B">1.0</a> was released today. I encourage <i>everyone</i> to check out this release.

For those wondering about the <a href="http://mg.cflib.org">Model-Glue conversion</a> of <a href="http://www.cflib.org">CFLib</a> - I have <b>not</b> given up on it. Real life just has a way of getting in the way, and now that I have multiple open source projects out there... well, it kind of fell to the way side. 

My priorities now are: BlogCFC 4.0, my DRK project (don't you wish you knew what it was ;), Galleon Forums 2.0, MG CFLib, Starfish (new project, shhhh), and Soundings updates. I'll be done sometime this century, I promise.
