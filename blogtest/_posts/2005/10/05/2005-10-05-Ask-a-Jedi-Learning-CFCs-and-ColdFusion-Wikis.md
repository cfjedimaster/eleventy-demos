Two short questions today. The first concerns CFC:

<blockquote>
I really like the usefulness of CFCs... What reference do you suggest for a newbie to buy to learn how to create and use them correctly?
</blockquote>

The best thing I can recommend is the <a href="http://www.cfczone.org/listserv.cfm">CFCDev mailing list</a>. It is a list server devoted to CFC development. I've recommended it many times before so forgive me if I'm repeating myself. There is also the <a href="http://www.cfczone.org">CFCZone</a> site itself, which has some example CFCs and links to other articles.

Dave asks:

<blockquote>
Have you seen any open source CFMX wiki apps floating around out there? I've been looking, but not finding much...
</blockquote>

I'm not aware of one.... but there <b>is</b> one more DRK coming out... I wonder if anyone out there writes a lot of DRK apps?
