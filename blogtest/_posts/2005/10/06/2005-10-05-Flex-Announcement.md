So, everyone and their brother is blogging about the <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/macromedia/proom/pr/2005/announcing_flex2.html">Flex 2/Flash 8.5</a> announcement today. I don't have much to add except that this is <i>exactly</i> what I had hoped Flex <b>1</b> would have been. I've seen Zorn in action, and I can say that it is <b>darn</b> nice. When the public Alpha starts on the 17th, I highly recommend you take a look at it.
