This is a very, very minor update. It includes a bug fix for the <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2005/10/8/IIS6-Bug-with-CFLOCATION">IE/II6</a> issue I talked about this weekend. It also includes a bug fix for an error that occured when someone posted a message after logging out. You may download Galleon <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/downloads/forums.zip">here</a>.
