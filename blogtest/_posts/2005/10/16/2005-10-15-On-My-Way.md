After waking up at 4AM this morning, I'm now sitting in the airport in Lafayette waiting for my journey to MAX to begin. I can't wait for this conference to begin, as I'm especially excited to see even more about the next Flex. If you are a reader of my blog and have any suggestions, feel free to pull me aside at MAX and let me know what you think.
