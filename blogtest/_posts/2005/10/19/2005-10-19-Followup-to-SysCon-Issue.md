So, last night I <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2005/10/19/Should-I-Be-Honored-or-Offended">blogged</a> about how one of my articles was being reprinted at Sys-Con without my permission. I got a lot of feedback from that posting (thanks everyone), and this morning I got a personal email from the group publisher for Sys-Con. We had breakfast and he explained that what had happaned was that the article was picked out as a <i>potential</i> article for republication, with my permission, but that the web team had thought permission was already granted. 

I did not think that there was anything malicious in what happaned, and it does seem like this is a mistake. A bad mistake - but a mistake. I did ask that the article be removed (how else will I pay for the 200 inch flat screen HDTV if I don't get my google adsense checks??) and was told that it would happen soon.

Those of you who read CFDJ know that I am involved with the magazine as the technical editor. I do not always get the chance to tech edit the articles before they go to publication, but when I do, I try to ensure they are properly written. I still feel like CFDJ is a good magazine. (And yes, I know that many people have had issues with the subscription department. I brought that up with the publisher.) I'm in kind of a special place. As you probably have noticed, over the last few months I've dramatically increased my posting amount and have tried to make this blog be <b>the</b> ColdFusion blog for my readers. This is not just because I'm a nice guy, I do get revenue from my sites, but I do hope that I provide a good service to my readers. So with all that being said, I'm a bit defensive about how my content is used. I think the publisher understands that now, and at least for me, I think things are resolved for now. 

I will post more if the situation changes. And with that - I may be offline for a while. I'm about 20 minutes away from my final presentation (that sounds a bit morbid ;) and after that I pack to head to the airport. So if you post any questions here, it may be a good day or so before I respond.
