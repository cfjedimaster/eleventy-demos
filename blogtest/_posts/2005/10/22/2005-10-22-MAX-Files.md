I finally got around to zipping up my MAX files and presentation. You can download it <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/downloads/max2005.zip">here</a>. If you have any questions, please let me know, and sorry for the delay. (And just in case it isn't obvious, you need to run these files under ColdFusion MX 7.0.1.)
