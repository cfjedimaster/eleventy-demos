Target has <a href="http://www.mybiggames.com/index_files/page0007.htm">announced</a> that they will soon be selling life-sized arcade games for less than 500 dollars. Each machine will be 62 inches tall and come with 12 games each. Sample games include Defender, Robotron, Sinistar (drool), but I don't see Galaga in there.

I don't know about you, but I've wanted a "real" arcade game in my house ever since I saw my first episode of <a href="http://www.sitcomsonline.com/silverspoons.html">Silver Spoons</a>.

And yes - I know I can home brew it and build my own MAME console - but to be honest, I hate dealing with my own hardware.
