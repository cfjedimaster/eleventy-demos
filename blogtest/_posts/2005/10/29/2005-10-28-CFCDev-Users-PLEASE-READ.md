I am aware of the "bombing" that has been going on the list. I am not sure <i>why</i> it is happening though. It looks like the email addresses that are no longer valid are having their failure notices showing up on list. That should not happen, of course. I am manually cleaning these people out when I can. I am going to open a ticket with MailEnable since it also appears we may have hit the max number of people for a mailing list, and obviously I want the list to grow.

However - I need to be away for most of today. So unfortunately I can't do anything else right now. I deeply apologize for any trouble this causes (boy do I love being an admin of a service ;) and I hope to have things cleared away tonight.
