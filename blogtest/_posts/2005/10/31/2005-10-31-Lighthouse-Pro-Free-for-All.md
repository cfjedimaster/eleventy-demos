<a href="http://lighthousepro.riaforge.org">Lighthouse Pro</a>, my ColdFusion bug tracking application is now free for all. You may download it now from the <a href="http://lighthousepro.riaforge.org">project</a> page. Please let me know what you think. I'm think I may have used Flash Forms a bit too much - so constructive UI criticism would be welcome.

Enjoy.
