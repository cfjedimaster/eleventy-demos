Ok, so maybe it isn't an "explosion", but we now have not one, but two sites offering podcasts of interest to ColdFusion developers.

The first is "The ColdFusion Podcast", located at <a href="http://www.coldfusionpodcast.com/">http://www.coldfusionpodcast.com/</a>.  Run by Bryan and Michael (sorry guys, don't know your last name), the site has two episodes up so far on a variety of topics. Well worth your time.

The other podcast is from Hal Helms and Jeff Peters. These podcasts may be found here: <a href="http://helmsandpeters.com/">http://helmsandpeters.com/</a> These podcasts are less CF-oriented and more project oriented, which makes them probably even more important and well worth your time.

(FYI, BlogCFC does allow you to podcast as well. As far as I know, no one using BlogCFC is using that yet though.)
