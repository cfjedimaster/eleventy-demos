Woohoo - the application was out for 24 hours before the first bug reports came rolling in, which is just fine. I want to see this application used by as many people as possible. So what has changed?

<ul>
<li>The SQL Server install script used a length of 50 for issue titles. This has been changed to 255.
<li>There was a bug using RSS feeds if you weren't an admin. Fixed.
<li>The RSS feed will now list the project name with each issue. A bit much for a single project RSS feed, but more useful in cases where your RSS feed is multi-project.
</ul>

You can download Lighthouse Pro from the <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/projects/lhp">project</a> page.
