Lots of updates - so here are the details:

<b>Lighthouse Pro</b><br>
Just changed the case of one SQL statement. Download from the <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/projects/lhp">project page</a>.

<b>Soundings</b><br>
Fixed a bug in matrix display. Download from the <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/projects/soundings">project page</a>.

<b>Blog Beta</b><br>
Fixed a bug with editing. Fixed mysql install script. Other misc small stuff here and there. (Thanks to Oguz and others for finding bugs.) Download <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/downloads/blogbeta.zip">here</a>.

Just an FYI, Rob Brooks-Bilson had a few good ideas so there will be one (maybe two) new features in the next update. So blame him for delaying "official" 4.0 launch. ;)
