Ugh. So my Mini Cooper has been giving me trouble lately, but I haven't had the chance to look into. Today my wife was driving back from Catahoula (yes, that's a real name) when our Town and Country decided to crap out. She had to drift into the school parking lot. So the TandC is at the shop, and of course, this means it will be gone all weekend. 

It also means I'm about 800 emails behind today, so forgive me for the lack of posting/responding.

On a funnier note - I'm running the new Google Desktop 2 Desktop bar, and so far I like it. One of the pods is a news pod. I'm not sure where it gets it's feeds from, and to be honest, I don't care as the feeds seem to be rather well chosen. Maybe a bit too well...

Last night I looked at my screen and saw:

<b>The Soviet air force has bombed the Hungarian capital, Budapest and Russian troops have poured into the city in a massive dawn offensive.</b>

Of course I about jumped out of my chair - but didn't understand why CSI was still playing when major world news was going on. 

Turns out - the news feed had picked up a "On This Day" <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/4/newsid_2739000/2739039.stm">article</a> from the BBC.

-sigh-

Thank goodness I'm not easily fooled.
