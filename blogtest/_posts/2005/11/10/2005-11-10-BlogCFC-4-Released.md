After <i>much</i> too much time, I'm happy to announce the release of <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/projects/blogcfc">BlogCFC 4.0</a>. With this release come numerous new features since the last official release. A short list of updates includes trackback support, search stats, layout improvements, bug fixes, etc. Also I'm happy to announce the launch of the <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/projects/blogcfc">BlogCFC project page</a>. This is the page to go to download the latest bits. 

BlogCFC is now in use at close to 100 blogs - something I <i>never</i> imagined when I first starting working on this project. I'm happy it has been so useful to folks, and I hope this new version exceeds my user's expectations. Of course, as with most of my releases, you can probably expect a .01 release shortly. ;)

So - this time, instead of shamelessly pointing people to my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/registry/2TCL1D08EZEYE">wishlist</a> (hey - don't stop on my account of course!), I'll point folks who want to show their appreciation to yet another <a href="http://ipodnanos.freepay.com/?r=22637619">"Free Ipod Nano"</a> site. (Which does work - as I got an Ipod last year. Which might make you wonder why I'm asking for a Nano - but why ask why?)

Enjoy.
