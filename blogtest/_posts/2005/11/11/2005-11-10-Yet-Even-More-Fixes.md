I've updated the BlogCFC 4.0 zip with a fix for print.cfm still using request.rooturl instead of application.rooturl. This along with the MS Access fixes are now listed in the release notes. What is not in the release notes is that I updated the trackback spam list. Every day I get new trackback spam, but at least it seems to be unique now. I'm thinking soon it will dwindle to nothing. 

As always, you can download the bits from the <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/projects/blogcfc">project page</a>.
