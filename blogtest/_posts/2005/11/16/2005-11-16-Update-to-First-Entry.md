So, I don't want to make a habit of this, but Steve sent me a quick fix to the IE problem in his <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2005/11/16/Intermediate-Contest-Entry-1">contest entry</a>. I've updated both the zip and the online version. It's already been discussed what was wrong, so this won't cover it up, but it will let folks with IE (and only IE, poor souls) play his contest entry.
