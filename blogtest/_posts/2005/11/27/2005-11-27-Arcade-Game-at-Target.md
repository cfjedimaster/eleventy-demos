So, I <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2005/10/28/And-now-for-something-really-important">blogged</a> a few weeks ago about how Target was going to start selling a 'real' arcade game for around 500 dollars. I saw the unit yesterday and I have mixed feelings about it. It is a bit too small - however, the unit I saw was on a ledge about 6 inches or so off the ground. If I did buy the unit, I would do the same - simply raise it up a bit.

However - what really turns me off is the size of the screen. Compared to the amount of space available in the case for screen to site in, the screen is quite small. 

How do the games look? Well, they are what you would expect from old games - but the point is to play them for fun - not for the high level graphics. That being said - the collection of games have a few hits (Sinistar is truly a classic) as well as some unknowns. 

The "experience" is "arcade-like", but the buttons felt a bit... smushy? Not sure how to describe it. They felt like they would tire the hands out quickly because of the force needed to push them. Of course, I played Joust which is a tiring game in general. 

So - is it worth the 500 bucks? Maybe. You can buy 'real' arcade games from <a href="http://www.brookstone.com/shop/thumbnail.asp?world_code=2&category_code=22&subcategory_code=170&search_type=subcategory&cm_re=A_BNR*MB*ARC">Brookstone.com</a>, but you will pay a premium for them, but from what I know, this is typical prices for classics like Galaga and Pac-Man. 

You can also build your own unit, but as I've said numerous times, I'm a hardware noob so that is out of the question. Hey - maybe someone wants to trade a few hours of development in exchange/consulting for the Galaga/Ms. Pac-Man unit?? :)
