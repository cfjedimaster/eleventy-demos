Karen asks,

Hi Ray, 
Looking for a hosting for a new website that will be done in  
ColdFusion. You know any?

So - this question is a rather simple one to answer. About as simple as 'Do you support the War on Terror' or 'Are you pro-choice or pro-life.' I'm sure this one post will result in about ten million comments or so. That being said, I will answer with that <b>I</b> think is the right answer. My company (<a href="http://www.mindseye.com">Mindseye</a>, and yes I know it's down at the moment) as well as I use <a href="http://www.hosting.com">Hosting.com</a>. Hosting.com graciously provides the box that runs this blog, <a href="http://www.cflib.org">CFLib</a>, <a href="http://www.cfczone.org">CFCZone.org</a> and the CFCDev list, and other resources free of charge. I can say I've seen cheaper hosting companies out there, but I like the turnaround time I've seen with them and I know my coworkers are happy with them as well.
