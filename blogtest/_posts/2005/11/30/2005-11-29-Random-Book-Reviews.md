I've finished two good books recently so I thought I'd give them a quick review. A few months ago I <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/2005/9/13/Book-Review-Perdido-Street-Station-by-China-Mieville">raved </a> about China Mi&eacute;ville and his book, Perdido Street Station. I recently finished <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&tag=raymondcamd06-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http{% raw %}%3A%{% endraw %}2F{% raw %}%2Fwww.amazon.com%{% endraw %}2Fgp{% raw %}%2Fproduct%{% endraw %}2F0345444388{% raw %}%2Fqid%{% endraw %}3D1133363016{% raw %}%2Fsr%{% endraw %}3D8-1{% raw %}%2Fref%{% endraw %}3Dpd_bbs_1{% raw %}%3Fn%{% endraw %}3D507846{% raw %}%2526s%{% endraw %}3Dbooks{% raw %}%2526v%{% endraw %}3Dglance">The Scar</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=raymondcamden-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />, which isn't a sequel per se, but does link a bit to the other novel. This book was amazing. Not as strong as Perdido Street Station, but darn close. I strongly recommend folks pick up either book. I'm currently reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&tag=raymondcamd06-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http{% raw %}%3A%{% endraw %}2F{% raw %}%2Fwww.amazon.com%{% endraw %}2Fgp{% raw %}%2Fproduct%{% endraw %}2F0312890729{% raw %}%2Fqid%{% endraw %}3D1133363167{% raw %}%2Fsr%{% endraw %}3D8-2{% raw %}%2Fref%{% endraw %}3Dpd_bbs_2{% raw %}%3Fn%{% endraw %}3D507846{% raw %}%2526s%{% endraw %}3Dbooks{% raw %}%2526v%{% endraw %}3Dglance">King Rat</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=raymondcamden-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />, which has started out quite well. (This book does not take place in the same world as Perdido Street Station.)

I'm a big fan of alternative history, and rather enjoyed <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&tag=raymondcamd06-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http{% raw %}%3A%{% endraw %}2F{% raw %}%2Fwww.amazon.com%{% endraw %}2Fgp{% raw %}%2Fproduct%{% endraw %}2F0345457129{% raw %}%2Fqid%{% endraw %}3D1133363266{% raw %}%2Fsr%{% endraw %}3D2-2{% raw %}%2Fref%{% endraw %}3Dpd_bbs_b_2_2{% raw %}%3Fs%{% endraw %}3Dbooks{% raw %}%2526v%{% endraw %}3Dglance{% raw %}%2526n%{% endraw %}3D283155">Weapons of Choice</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=raymondcamden-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />. The premise is that a naval force from the future (2020 I think) gets sent back to World War 2. The book is pretty entertaining, although it did tend to focus a bit too much on the weapons, like a typical Clancy book. I like weapons of destruction as much as the next guy, but I wanted more drama from the story. Still though - it was loads better than the last Turtledove book I read.
