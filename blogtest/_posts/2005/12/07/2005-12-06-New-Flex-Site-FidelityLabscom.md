I am <i>very</i> proud to say that my company helped build this new Flex site: <a href="http://www.fidelitylabs.com">FidelityLabs.com</a>. The purpose of the site is to offer the best advice on loans and loan providers by acting as a search engine for financial sites. I had zero to do with this site - but wanted to brag on my coworkers!
