So, I figure why stop at 2 OT posts when I can I go for three? Last month I <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2005/11/23/My-XBox-has-gone-to-that-great-game-graveyard-in-the-sky">blogged</a> about my XBox's hard drive crashing. I decided to ahead and send it in. I was told that the repair time would be five to eight business days, which ain't too bad. I sent it in. UPS dropped it off at the repair center on the 1st. I figured with the holiday rush, I'd be lucky if the unit was sent back by the 9th.

Get this - they actually fixed it and shipped it on the 2nd. It was there one whole day. Nice. I'd actually have it now but for two days in a row UPS has some weird error with the package. Supposedly it is on the truck today, but UPS doesn't deliver to my street till after 6PM. Then I get to find out if my saved games were rescued. I tell ya - out of this whole thing - the thing that gets me most upset is the fact that some games don't allow you to back up the saves to a card. As my hard drive was slowly dying, I quickly copied as many games as I could, but some games don't allow that option. I <i>believe</i> it is to prevent cheating - but no reason is good enough for me. Until the day they create a non-breakable hard drive, this option of preventing game save backups should not be allowed.
