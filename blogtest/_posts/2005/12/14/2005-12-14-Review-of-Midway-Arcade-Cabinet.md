So I don't like to just blog links, but a few weeks ago I <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2005/11/27/Arcade-Game-at-Target">blogged</a> about the 'cheap' arcade game that Target is selling. RetroBlast has a much more indepth <a href="http://www.retroblast.com/reviews/biggames.html">review</a>, and a pretty negative one at that.
