The <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2005/10/30/Intermediate-ColdFusion-Contest">Intermediate  ColdFusion Contest</a> is now over. We had 11 great entries. I want to thank  everyone who submitted code. I <i>know</i> it was scary for you. But these entries were <b>very</b> helpful. Not only did you show people how to solve a problem, but your mistakes were useful in educating others. Thank you again. I also want to thank all my readers who commented - and did so in a respectful way. Ok, so enough with the that, let's just get to the winner(s).

First off - I have 2 prizes to give away to the runner ups. Adobe was very generous and gave me a copy of Studio to give away. I'm giving this to Tony Weeg for his <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2005/12/12/Intermediate-Contest-Entry-10">entry</a>. This had my favorite design, so I figure Studio was a good award. 

The next prize is for Scott Johnson and his <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2005/12/1/Intermediate-Contest-Entry-8">entry</a>, which I thought was an awesome use of Flash Forms. His prize was provided by <a href="http://www.teratech.com">TeraTech</a>. It is a 50% off ticket to <a href="http://www.cfunited.org">CFUnited 06</a>. 

Last but not least - the grand prize - a copy of ColdFusion Standard (Thank you again Adobe!) is given to Behrang Noroozinia. His <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2005/11/23/Intermediate-Contest-Entry-4">entry</a> did a good job at validation, and I really liked his history management. To be honest, this is just a personal feeling, but his entry pleased me the most. I <i>know</i> folks are going to disagree with me, which is fine, but as I said, the main point of this contest was for us to all learn, which I think we did.

So - that's all for now. Start the critiquing of my decision below. Once again I want to give big thanks to everyone who participated, and to Macr... Adobe and TeraTech!
