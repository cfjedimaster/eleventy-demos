The <a href="http://cfunited.com/topics.cfm">speakers and topics</a> for next year's <a href="http://www.cfunited.com">CFUnited</a> have been revealed. I will be speaking on two topics: "From functions to CFCs" (I don't think I actually proposed this, so I may need to figure out exactly what they want. The description seems to imply moving from UDFs to CFCs.) and "Verity Searching Secret" (I believe they meant Secret<b>s</b>). Both topics are things I enjoy, so I hope to see you there!
