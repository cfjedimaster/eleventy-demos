I wrote an <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/devnet/coldfusion/articles/coding_contest.html">article </a> for Dev Center covering the first <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2005/9/20/Contest-Shall-We-Play-a-Game">ColdFusion</a> contest I ran. The picture and bio is a bit old, so please don't think I actually look that young. (Just add some gray and about 20 pounds. I blame the kids.)
