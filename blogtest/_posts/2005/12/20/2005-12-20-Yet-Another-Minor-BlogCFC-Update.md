Hot on the heels of a <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2005/12/16/BlogCFC-ColdFusion-Blog-402-Released">release</a> last Friday, I have yet another minor update to BlogCFC. Changes are:

<ul>
<li>/client/index.cfm - Rob Gonda made the del.ico.us link a bit more nice
<li>/org/camden/blog/blog.cfc - MS Access fix to my earlier offset fix
<li>/org/camden/blog/blog.cfc - I don't remove HTML from rss2 full feed now.
<li>/org/camden/blog/ping.cfc - Wrap the icerocket xmlparse in try/catch
<li>/install/ - Docs updated. Just a few typos fixed.
</ul>

Enjoy. As always, it can be downloaded <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/projects/blogcfc">here</a>. Today's build brought to you by Lush and "De-Luxe".
