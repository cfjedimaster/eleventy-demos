Know Flash? Want to learn Flex? <a href="http://www.mindseye.com">Mindseye</a> is hiring. Best of all - you get to work on my team and hear me rant about source control and how much nicer ColdFusion is compared to .Net! Here is the job description:

<b>Junior Flash/AS/Web Application</b><br>
Mindseye has an immediate opening for a Junior Flash/AS/Web Application 
Developer to assist in the development and maintenance of websites and 
flash-based applications.  You will be part of a talented, 
cross-discipline development team.  You will work primarily from our 
Boston office, which offers a casual yet hard-working atmosphere; some 
telecommuting is okay.

You must be quick on your feet and able to learn new technologies on the 
job. Knowledge of Flash/ActionScript, general web architecture, and one 
or more of the following technologies is a must:
<ul>
<li>ASP.NET (C#-based) and/or ASP
<li>Flex
<li>Java/JSP and/or JavaScript
<li>ColdFusion
<li>XML/XSLT
<li>DHTML
<li>CSS
</ul>

This is a Flash postion - but you will be learning Flex. If you already 
know Flex, it will be a definite plus.

Mindseye offers a generous benefits package, including fully paid health 
insurance, dental, 401(k), 3-weeks vacation and 10 paid holidays. Our 
office is conveniently located just minutes from South Station in 
Boston, where the Red Line and Commuter Rail converge.

Interested candidates should forward their resume, salary requirements 
and a code sample to hr@mindseye.com. First consideration will be given 
to those applicants who include all the requested information.
