I've gotten quite a bit of track back spam here. Luckily my TB spam list seems to work rather well. For example, I don't get TB spam on drugs anymore since I've covered almost all of them. Now the trend seems to be vacations and cruises. Just a few minutes ago, though, I got an interesting TB from carsblog.biz. She spammed an entry on the intermediate CF contest. For the heck of it I decided to visit the blog. Turns out it appears to be a "real" blog. In other words, it seems like a decent blog on car news. There are even some personal entries in there. (That's how I found out it was a she, since she mentioned her husband, although I suppose it could be a gay man as well.)

I was going to leave a snide comment, but comments are not enabled. Then I noticed a link to <a href="http://weblogs.us/">Weblogs.us</a>, a free blog hosting service. I took my fight to them and emailed the admin to let them know about the spammer.

It is too bad that someone who obviously put some thought into their blog decided to resort to spamming. Sad and stupid. I've had maybe 2 blog entries on cars here throughout the entire life of the blog. 

Of course - while it may be sad - I have no mercy for spammers. So how about <b>everyone</b> who reads this blog send a nice email to the admin of weblogs.us at jd.hodges AT gmail.com. Let him know that a spammer on his site is attacking one of the blogs you read. I don't blame him, of course, but he should be made aware of the problem with one of his scummy users.
