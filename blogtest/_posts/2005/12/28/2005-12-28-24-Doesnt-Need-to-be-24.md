So am I the only who a) loves 24 (the characters, the world they live, etc.) but b) can't stand the whole 24 hour concept anymore? I mean, come on. The first season, or two, it really added to the drama. Now it is just plain silly. You have some good characters and back story now. Just drop the real time "writers hack" and give us a good story!
