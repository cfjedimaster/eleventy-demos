So, less then <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2005/12/28/Lighthouse-Pro-ColdFusion-Bug-Tracker--Version-2">24 hours</a> later, I've got an update for <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/projects/lhp">Lighthouse Pro</a>. Thanks to two users, a few bugs have been fixed. Check the readme.txt for more information.
