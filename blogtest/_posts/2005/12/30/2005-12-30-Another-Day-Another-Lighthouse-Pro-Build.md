Wow, you would almost think I don't do any QA on my project. I've updated <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/projects/lhp">Lighthouse Pro</a> again today. At least one of the bugs was an old one. Anyway, here are the fixes:

<ul>
<li>Filters wouldn't properly say they were filtering.
<li>Bug Status filter wouldn't restore.
<li>When we send an email out about an issue, the bug type portion wasn't working right, so you would see stuff like this: Bug (Was Bug)
</ul>

Today's Build was brought to you by the letter X (because I played X-Men Legends for about four hours), and the number 6 (because questions are a burden for others).
