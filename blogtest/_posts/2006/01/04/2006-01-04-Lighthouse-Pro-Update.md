Another minor update to <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/projects/lhp">Lighthouse Pro</a>:

<ul>
<li>The SQL Server script was hosed for the pre-seeded data. This prevented you from logging in with the default logins or using any of the default loci, etc. Big whoops on my part.
<li>Minor fix to project editing.
</ul>

As usual, you can download the zip from the <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/projects/lhp">project</a> page. Today's build was brought to you by "Breathe Me", from Sia, originally heard (by me) on the <i>most</i> excellent finale of Six Feet Under. (The absolute best ending to a TV show I've seen yet.)
