I thought I'd drop a quick ntoe to let folks know how the site was going, and give a sneak peak of the UI. Most of the functionality is done. What I still need to do is:

<ul>
<li>Implement comments. I will be using <a href="http://www.alagad.com">Alagad</a>'s CAPTHA component for this. (Thanks to them for donating it!)
<li>Search
<li>RSS
<li>Security stuff. As folks know, I'm a bit anal about my URL params, so I need to a quick once through.
<li>FAQ. This is partially done actually, and I'll probably launch with it being incomplete for now.
</ul>

And finally, here is a screen shot. The design is <b>not</b> mine. I got it from the <a href="http://www.oswd.org">Open Source Web Design</a> site.
