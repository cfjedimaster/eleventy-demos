I released an update to the <a href="http://www.coldfusioncookbook.com">ColdFusion Cookbook</a> site this morning. Comments are now enabled. So - please - comment away! Thanks go to Doug Hughes and <a href="http://www.alagad.com">Alagad</a> for the Captcha component. I'm typically anti-captcha - but most of my sites get pretty swamped by spam - so if this stops even a bit of it - it is well worth the effort.

I've also cleaned up a few things here and there, including the PDF. I still think the PDF is pretty bad - but it isn't as ugly as it originally was.

Also note that we now have 17 entries - again thanks to <a href="http://www.brooks-bilson.com/blogs/rob/">Rob</a> and <a href="http://www.petersenfam.com/jeremy/">Jeremy</a>. I've also gotten close to 10 or so cookbook submissions. I was just waiting for the comment code to launch. Now I will have time to start going through the submissions.
