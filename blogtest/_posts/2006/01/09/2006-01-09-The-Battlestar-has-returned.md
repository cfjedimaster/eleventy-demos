So I'm a few days late, but last Friday, the second half of season two of <a href="http://www.scifi.com/battlestar/">Battlestar Galactica</a> started. I've blogged about this show before - but I cannot rave enough about how good this second half of the season has begun. My main complaint this season was how "emotional" it was. That's not always such a bad thing - but after the non-stop action of season one, it was a bit of a letdown. Mind you - I still thought it was the best sci-fi on TV - I just felt it wasn't as strong as season one.

Well - if Friday's episode is any indication - this second half of the season is like - well - a swift kick to the nether regions. I was really surprised how good it was. 

So - once again - if you aren't watching the show - pick up the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=as2&path=ASIN/B000AJJNFE&tag=raymondcamd06-20&camp=1789&creative=9325"><img border="0" src="B000AJJNFE.01._AA_SCMZZZZZZZ_.jpg"><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=raymondcamden-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B000AJJNFE" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />first season DVD</a> (and ensure it is the version with the mini-series) and then get Season 2 from the iTunes store.
