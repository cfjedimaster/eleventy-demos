I'm sure many other blogs are going to be posting this, but I wanted to pass on this Breeze presentation from Shantanu Narayen, Adobe President and COO. 

Linkage here: <a href="http://adobe.breezecentral.com/drupdate0106/">http://adobe.breezecentral.com/drupdate0106/</a>

The presentation relates directly to Adobe and Developer Relations. Don't do what I do - run it with <a href="http://www.indev.no/">FlushMute</a> turned on. I thought for a minute it was an oddly quiet presentation. :)
