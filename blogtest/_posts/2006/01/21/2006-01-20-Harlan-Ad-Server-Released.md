Six months ago today DRK12 was released by Macromedia. On that DRK I released a product called Harlan Ad Server. Harlan was a tool to allow you to earn money from your web sites by generating ads and advertising campaigns. Much like Google AdSense (which I use here), Harlan generates JavaScript code that can be placed on your web site (or even on a totally unrelated, non-ColdFusion web site). Once your ads are displayed, you can begin tracking the results including impressions and click throughs.

Before today, Harlan was only avaiable on the DRK. Now it is available to everyone. Please see the license in the readme.txt file for more information. To download the application, please visit the <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/projects/harlan">project page</a>.
