A few weeks back Ben Forta sent me a copy of one of his new books, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&tag=raymondcamd06-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http{% raw %}%3A%{% endraw %}2F{% raw %}%2Fwww.amazon.com%{% endraw %}2Fgp{% raw %}%2Fproduct%{% endraw %}2F0672327120{% raw %}%2Fsr%{% endraw %}3D1-1{% raw %}%2Fqid%{% endraw %}3D1138027461{% raw %}%2Fref%{% endraw %}3Dpd_bbs_1{% raw %}%3F%{% endraw %}255Fencoding%3DUTF8">MySQL Crash Course</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=raymondcamden-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />. I've been a casual user of MySQL for a while now, but I typically prefer to use SQL Server. After reading this book, I have a much bigger appreciation for the power and usefulness of MySQL. There were many features that I simply wasn't aware of, and while I could have read the docs (I know, RTFM), I have to say that I <i>really</i> enjoyed the format of this book. 

As an author, I've been a part of many "big" books (1000+ pages), and while they certainly have their place, I loved how quick and easy it was to read the Crash Course. I could easily skip over the stuff I already knew, and the material was very short and sweet. The size of the book also makes it a perfect desk companion. I'd love to see more books in this format, even a ColdFusion one. 

As a side note, I'd recommend <a href="http://www.mysqlfront.de/">MySQL-Front</a> for a visual client. It has had issues in the past, but seems pretty stable. I especially like the export options (html is one of them and is a great way to do a simple report). It isn't free, though, but 35 bucks is pretty cheap.
