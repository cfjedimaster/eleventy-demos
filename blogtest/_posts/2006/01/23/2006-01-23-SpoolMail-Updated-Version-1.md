SpoolMail has been updated to version 1(it makes sense, really, I released it at version 0). What's new? Well now I actually include the CF Admin Application.cfm file. This means that the application will now be password protected like the rest of the admin. (Duh.) I also had some good fixes sent in by users, including:

<ul>
<li>A timeout so a directory full of files won't time out the code.</li>
<li>Handling of zero-length mail files.</li>
</ul>

Enjoy! As always, you can download the code from the <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/projects/spoolmail">project page</a>. What projects are next in line to get some good ole Jedi love? <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/projects/harlan">Harlan Ad Server</a> will have a minor update this week. I didn't actually think people would use it - but they are and are sending in some good comments. After that I have a bigger update coming for <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/projects/lhp">Lighthouse Pro</a>.
