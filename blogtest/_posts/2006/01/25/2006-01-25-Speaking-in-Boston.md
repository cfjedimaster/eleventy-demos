So, it is <i>very</i> short notice, but I will be in Boston next week and will be speaking at the Boston CFUG. 

The meeting will be held on Friday the 3rd of February. The meeting will be held in a conference room at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, 600 Atlantic Ave. (4th floor) directly across the street from South Station. It will begin at 6:30. 

The building owners are asking that I supply a list to ease security into the building, so RSVP's should be emailed to brinaldi@remotesynthesis.com (additional people can show up, but they said having a list can simplify things for security). 

Brian also asks that you email him some topic ideas - otherwise I'll spend the time talking about Star Wars.

I'll bring along some books for a give away as well. (Which should be safe unless the airline loses my luggage.... again.)
