So, last nights episode was a bit slow - but I think one thing was made obvious - Charlie will be the first person to "go to the Dark Side." By that I mean he will leave the camp and join the Others. This will be our first real deep look into the Others camp. Just a prediction - but I'm pretty confident on this. He is pretty much a pariah now at the main camp, and from the flash backs it was obvious he wants to belong to a family. 

Also - and maybe I'm falling into the "oh my god did you notice this one tiny little detail" camp - did anyone else think the offhand comment about the washing machines being new was significant? I had thought that perhaps that Hanso (or is it Hanzo? I forget) had perhaps abandoned the Island. Maybe they are still monitoring things and providing basic support.
