This is a small update, written by Steve 'Cutter' Blades (no.junk at comcast.net). It adds a "Select All" JavaScript doohicky so you can quickly select all of the emails in the folder. Very, very handy for clearing out old stuff (or moving all back to the spool). This is version 1.0.1 and can be downloaded from the <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/projects/spoolmail">SpoolMail project page</a>.

<i>This build was brought to you by the Smiths, "How Soon is Now", one of the absolute best songs ever created. The kind of song I think Beethoven would probably like.</i>
