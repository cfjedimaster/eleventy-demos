I've uploaded a small update to <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/projects/lhp">Lighthouse Pro</a> that corrects a problem with yesterday's build. Props go to Tom Cornilliac for finding out that if you edited old issues, an error was thrown. You can download the files, as always, from the <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/projects/lhp">project page</a>.
