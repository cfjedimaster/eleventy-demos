I've had a request or two for this in the past, and I thought it was time I finally got around to it. I've added a new <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/projects/projects.cfm">Projects</a> page to my site that gives, at a high level, what the plans are for my projects. It does not cover everything, of course, but if folks are curious about what is coming next, it is the page to check.
