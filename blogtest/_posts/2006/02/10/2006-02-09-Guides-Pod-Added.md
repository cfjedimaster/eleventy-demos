I've added a new pod to the right of the blog. The pod contains the guides I've created, one for Application.cfc, and one for the CFC Scopes reference. I should probably rename the Application.cfc link. It isn't a reference, but more of a skeleton. The idea being that you can cut and paste this as a "base" Application.cfc template.
