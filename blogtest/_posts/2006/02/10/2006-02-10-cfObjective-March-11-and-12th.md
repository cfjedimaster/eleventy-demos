Just in case you missed it, registration is now open for <a href="http://www.cfobjective.com/conference/">cf.Objective()</a>, which has  a funny name but should be a great conference. Some darn good speakers are lined up, and Jared, the man behind the conference, is a great guy. This is definitely worth your money.
