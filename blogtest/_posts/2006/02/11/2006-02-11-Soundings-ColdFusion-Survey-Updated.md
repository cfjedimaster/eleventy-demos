I've updated <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/projects/soundings">Soundings</a>, my ColdFusion Survey application, with some minor bug fixes and a major performance change. The details are below:

<ul>
<li>Charting would drop labels if too many answers were present. For more information, see this <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2006/2/10/CFCHART-and-the-Case-of-the-Disappearing-Labels">blog entry</a>.
<li>Matrix questions would chart their answers and items in random order. Now they maintain the order you set when designing the question.
<li>Excel reporting was super slow. I mean - very, very, very slow. It should now be significantly faster.
</ul>

As always, you can download the application from the <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/projects/soundings">project page</a>. If you find the application useful, please visit my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/registry/2TCL1D08EZEYE">wish list</a>.
