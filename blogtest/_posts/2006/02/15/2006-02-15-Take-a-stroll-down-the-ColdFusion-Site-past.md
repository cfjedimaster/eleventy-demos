...AKA the ColdFusion site graveyard.

I was cleaning out my bookmarks when I came across this gem: 

<a href="http://www.macromedia.com/devnet/server_archive/articles/cf_server_community.html">ColdFusion Server Community Sites</a>

I don't know about you, but this list sure brought back some memories. I'd say a good majority of those sites are dead now. I seem to remember writing for CF Advisor back in what seems like the dark ages.
