Doug Cain posted a cool pod to the <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/forums/threads.cfm?forumid=CBD2117A-E4A8-E459-8B6AE34595361CED">BlogCFC Pod</a> forum. If you aren't aware of what the pod forum is, it is simply a forum to share different pods to deploy with BlogCFC. This pod allows you to embed a pod cast directly in your blog. On Doug's <a href="http://www.dougcain.net/blog/index.cfm/2006/2/17/Too-cool-for-school">blog post</a>, he talks a bit about the pod and you can sample it at the blog as well. Now he uses it for someone else's podcast, but I think it would be a great way to share your <i>own</i> pod cast, if you chose to make one.
