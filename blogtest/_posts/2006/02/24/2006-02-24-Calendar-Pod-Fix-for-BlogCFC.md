As I've mentioned before, the next rev of BlogCFC is many moons away, but a user discovered another bug with offsets this week so I thought I'd share the fix. You only need to download this file if you use the offset feature of BlogCFC. Click the download link below to download the new calendar pod file. Save it in the pods directory, refresh your blog cache, and you are good to go.<p><a href='enclosures/D{% raw %}%3A%{% endraw %}5Cwebsites{% raw %}%5Ccamdenfamily%{% endraw %}5Csource{% raw %}%5Cmorpheus%{% endraw %}5Cblog{% raw %}%5Cenclosures%{% endraw %}2Fcalendar%2Ezip'>Download attached file.</a></p>
