Tom sent me this interesting <a href="http://www.ew.com/ew/article/commentary/0,6115,1162044_3_0_,00.html">article</a> over at EW that attempts to answer the mysteries of LOST. The most interesting one is the fifth theory, which I think is closest to my theory (although I think there are multiple psychics 'haunting' the Island).
