Today I am happy to announce the public release of <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/projects/canvas">CanvasWiki</a>, a ColdFusion-based wiki implementation. License information may be found in the readme.txt, and as always, if you find this application useful, drop by the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/registry/2TCL1D08EZEYE">wishlist</a>.

This is the last of my DRK projects. I think everyone should really give props to Macromedia/Adobe for the DRKs. They supported <i>multiple</i> projects from me that the community uses and were kind enough to let me open source the projects after a certain amount of time. That is <i>very</i> generous of them.
