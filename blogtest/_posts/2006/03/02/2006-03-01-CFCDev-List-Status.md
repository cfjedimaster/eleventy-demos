CFCDev is currently disabled. Once again, stupid freaking <a href="http://www.mailenable.com">MailEnable</a> decided to go crazy. This is the second time it has done so - completing filling the drive and just simply going insane. The queue had 120k emails in it - and for some reason was posting bounces back to me (my home address, not my gmail address which is what I use for cfcdev) and the list itself, and since ME's support forums are down, I've decided to just turn the list off until tomorrow morning. Sorry folks - but I got to sleep.
