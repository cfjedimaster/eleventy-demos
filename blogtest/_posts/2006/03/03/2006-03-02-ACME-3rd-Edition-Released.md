The third edition of the <a href="http://www.stephencollins.org/acme/">ACME Guide</a> was released by Stephen Collins this week. If you already tried to download it and had problems (as I did), the download is now properly fixed.  For those who don't know about the guide and missed my earlier raves, the ACME Guide is a book that helps you transform a new machine into the perfect ColdFusion development box. It walks you through the set up of the web server, database server, ColdFusion, an editor, and source control as well.

If I could have <b>one</b> book on my computer, this would be the only one I'd ask for. I know I'm going to need it this summer when I finally pick up the Mac laptop I've had my eyes on. So stop what you are doing and <a href="http://www.stephencollins.org/acme/">download</a> it today.
