I recently started frequenting a site called <a href="http://www.digg.com/">digg</a>. It is a news site - a bit like <a href="http://www.slashdot.org">slashdot</a>, but I find the articles to be much more interesting. Today it linked to a <a href="http://www.ipodbank.com/showthread.php?t=201">story</a> concerning how to get a free iTunes song. All you have to do is fill out a simple survey.

However - the reason I'm taking the time to blog about it is <i>not</i> that someone was pointing out how to get a free song, but how to get <i>multiple</i> free songs by simply using multiple email addresses and doing the survey again and again. Or in other words - cheating.

Excuse me - but when did the net get populated by four year olds? Did the poster spend one darn minute thinking that maybe this wasn't the right thing to do? I filled the survey - honestly (although I really don't know much about mechanical pencils), but will not be doing it again. One person on the link above even bragged about getting <b>186 free songs</b>. Jeeze. Now that's something to be proud of. I mean, I'm sure Paper Mate has to pay for all those songs, and we all know how evil Paper Mate can be. They deserve to be ripped off for um - you know - making pens and stuff.
