Tomorrow I'll be <a href="http://coldfusion.meetup.com/17/events/4874951/">presenting</a> at the Online ColdFusion Meetup Group. I will be giving a preview of my CFUNITED presentations, so I'll be talking a bit about CFCs and Verity. It is a very short meeting so it's really more of a "sneak peak", but hopefully it will give you a good idea of what I'm covering.
