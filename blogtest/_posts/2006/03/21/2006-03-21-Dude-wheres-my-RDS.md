It seems as if there was a lot of confusion in regards to getting RDS support into Eclipse. Steven Erat has <a href="http://www.talkingtree.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/3/21/Install-RDS-Plugin">posted</a> a nice little slide show about the process. It seems like the confusion stems from two problems. The documentation kind of makes it seems like you use Eclipse's auto-updating feature to get RDS support in. You do not. You simply download the plugin, copy it to your plugins folder, and restart Eclipse. The other problem (in my opinion) is that the link is kind of poorly named. Steven's slide show points out exactly what you need to click on.
