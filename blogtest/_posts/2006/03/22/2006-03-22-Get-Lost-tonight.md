Ok, so it's not like I'm addicted or anything, but don't forget that Lost returns tonight. 8PM on ABC (of course). Also, it was announced that the season finale for Lost will air on May 24th (and will be a 2 hour episode).

On, and since folks <i>really</i> like to talk about the show, I set up a <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/forums/forums.cfm?conferenceid=240470C3-A0AE-3FF3-C4D1640560DEA426">forum</a> to talk about it.
