Woohoo! Another bug related to the tableprefix feature. I'm thinking of my friend know who suggested now and sending evil thoughts to him. ;) Anyway, the <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/projects/soundings">project page</a> has been updated with the new build and zip number. Also, someone just sent in a nice little idea. The idea was to allow a 'clear results' type function. That way you can play with your survey and when ready to go live, easily remove all the test submissions. I'll try to get that in next week.

Here is a crazy question. Who thinks my applications need a logo?

<b>Edited:</b> I forgot to mention. Today's build is brought to you by Fatboy Slim.
