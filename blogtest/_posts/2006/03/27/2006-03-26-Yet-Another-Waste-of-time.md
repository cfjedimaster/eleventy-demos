I launched a new blog last week and was going to stay quiet about it, but figured it won't ever get any traffic unless I actually mention it. Just to be clear, this isn't a tech blog and it would be nice to say it was a complete waste of time, but even that is a bit too much probably. ;) 

<a href="http://www.egoaddict.com"><img src="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/images/ego.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" border="0"></a> I'd like to preset <a href="http://www.egoaddict.com">EgoAddict</a>. The idea behind it is pretty simple. I've noticed lately a small, but growing, collection of sites and tools whose sole purpose is inflate ones ego. So for example, the first tool I've reviewed at EgoAddict is a tool to figure out the net worth of your blog. 

I know - pointless. Less than pointless. But hey, it's fun and I really thought it would be cool to aggregate these tools. If you have any comments or ideas, add it to my <a href="http://www.egoaddict.com/index.cfm/2006/3/24/Welcome-can-we-talk">first entry</a> where I introduce the site.
