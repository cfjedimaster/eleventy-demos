So I know a few people are working hard on my <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2006/2/22/Advanced-Contest-Announced">latest contest</a>, but I thought it might help to extend the deadline a little bit. That and I'm about as swamped as I can be as well. (And for some reason, with the warm spring air I'm not waking up at my normal 5AM anymore.) So I'm extending the deadline to April 8th (which happens to be my birthday in case you want to bribe me).
