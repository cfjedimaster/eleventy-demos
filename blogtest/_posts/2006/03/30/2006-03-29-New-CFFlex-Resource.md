Simeon has <a href="http://www.simb.net/blog/index.cfm/2006/3/30/New-Flex-Resource-For-CF-Developers--FlexCFcom">posted</a> about a new site for ColdFusion developers using Flex: <a href="http://www.flexcf.com/CanvasWiki/index.cfm">FlexCF.com</a>. One cool thing about the site (if I may say so myself) is that it makes use of two of my projects, <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/projects/canvas">CanvasWiki</a> and <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/projects/galleon">Galleon ColdFusion Forums</a>.
