I've updated my <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/enclosures/cfcscopes.pdf">CFC Scopes</a> reference. A reader (Falcon79 - sounds like a mid-80s CIA code name) pointed out I didn't mention the Super scope. While it isn't a "variables scope" like the others in the document, I do think it makes sense to add it.
