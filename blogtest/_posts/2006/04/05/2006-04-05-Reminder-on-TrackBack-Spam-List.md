A month or so ago I <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2006/3/1/BlogCFC-Trackback-Spam-List-Exposed">blogged</a> about an interface I built to reveal my TB spam list. This interface lets BlogCFC users update their TB spam list by copying it from my list. I recently turned off trackbacks (thanks spammers), but I wanted folks to know that the list is still being updated. Do not forget that you can use the list to block comment spam as well. The list may be found here:

It has some naughty words in it, so you might want to wash your hands after reading it.
