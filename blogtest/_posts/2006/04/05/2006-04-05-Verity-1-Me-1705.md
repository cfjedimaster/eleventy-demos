I love Verity, really, I do. But something strange happened today. A site which has been using Verity for ages (well, since CFMX7) suddenly reported an odd error today:

<blockquote>
Collection (status code): theCollectionNameHere (-1705) 
</blockquote>

Of course, I already had a script that did a purse/reindex. So I ran that, and immediately the search began working again. Anyone else seen this before?
