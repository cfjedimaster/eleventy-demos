Because I cannot fight <a href="http://www.corfield.org/blog/">the</a> <a href="http://www.jeffryhouser.com/index.cfm/2006/4/4/Because-Mer-Tagged-Me">meme</a> spreading around the blog-o-sphere today, I thought I'd chime in as well. Here are 40 things about me you (probably) already knew:

</ol>

Four of my favorite foods:

Four foods I dislike:

</ol>

Four places I would rather be right now: (Well, I love where I am, so these are places I want to visit)
<ol>
<li>South Korea (Do I need to explain?)
<li>China

</ol>

Four friends I have tagged to do this - I'm following the advice of others and will not be tagging others. Follow the meme if you want!
