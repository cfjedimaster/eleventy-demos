Version 1.5.2 was released today. Changes are listed below:

<ul>
<li>There was a pretty bad bug that cropped up if you deleted a question and  didn't "fix" the ranks by making sure they were no missing numbers. This should be corrected now.
<li>John Paul Ashenfelter provided some CSS fixes that helps remove some of my ugly HTML (pardon me, I'm an old schooler ;) and makes things a bit cleaner. I think it still has work to do, but it's better. Thanks John!
<li>The title of the survey now displays on each page. This was an obvious and dumb thing for me to forget. Thanks go to a user who pointed it out. (I forget who.)
<li>Matrix questions weren't correctly showing the right selected cells if you went backwards in the survey. Thanks go to a user who pointed it out. (I forget who.)
</ul>

As always, you can download Soundings from the <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/projects/soundings">project page</a>. This time I <i>will</i> mention my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/registry.html/104-1251129-9971151?id=2TCL1D08EZEYE">wishlist</a>, but only because I made a decision on XM over Sirius (that should spawn a few hundred comments). Just in case someone is feeling extra generous. ;)
