I've <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2006/2/3/Norton-and-Short-Cuts">blogged</a> <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm?mode=entry&entry=D6932DDE-9D70-AD5B-4BA605A0B7E2BE08">before</a>  about <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm?mode=entry&entry=316695B6-B176-F0A4-56AF22FD93D1AE0F">Norton</a> and how much trouble it gives me. I've found yet another reason to dislike it. Apparently it breaks <a href="http://www.techfeed.net/cfQuickDocs/">cfQuickDocs</a>. To me, that's like breaking air - it's just not good. I rely on cfQuickDocs and hit it at least 20 times a day. When the creator recently updated the site, it stopped working for me. I got JavaScript errors in both Firefox and IE. On my laptop, I did not. 

Turns out the issue was Norton. Something about the JavaScript bugged it so it just stripped it out. I tried various settings, but nothing worked quite right till I turned off Intrusion Detection. I should also point out that this is Norton Internet Security. My laptop just has Norton AV and doesn't have this problem. 

Needless to say, Norton will <i>not</i> be getting any more money from me.
