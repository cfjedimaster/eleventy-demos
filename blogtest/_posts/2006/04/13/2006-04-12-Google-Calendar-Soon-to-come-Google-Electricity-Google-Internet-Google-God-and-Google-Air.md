Ok, so I'm only joking about those last few items, but I am <b>extremely</b> psyched to see that <a href="http://google.com/calendar">Google Calendar</a> is here. I've been waiting for this ever since the rumours cropped up a few weeks back. Personally I'm addicted to Google like a crack addict and this just makes it worse.

One minor nit - the XML feed doesn't seem to be standard RSS. That is something I would have done, with maybe the next ten events as the "articles" for the feed. It does have iCal support, but I had trouble getting Sunbird to load it.

Anyway - so far it seems nice. I like the layout. I need to see if I can add it to my personalized home page, and if so, I may just leave MyYahoo.
