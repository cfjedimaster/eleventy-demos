<a href="http://www.mcchris.com"><img src="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/images/fett.jpg" border="0" align="left" hspace="5"></a> So it was the end of the day yesterday when one of my coworkers mentioned <a href="http://www.mcchris.com">MC Chris</a> to me. I had never heard of him, but he said I should head over to his web site and download Fett's Vette. This is - without a doubt - one of the funniest songs I've heard in a long time. You <b>must</b> stop what you are doing and download it now. In fact, his entire album is free, and actually pretty cool I think. As a word of warning, this song throws the F-bomb about 10 times more than your average Sopranos episode, so it may not be work safe. Put the headphones on!

Speaking of Star Wars, my wife got me the Slave 1 for my birthday. It is about a third done and I may post a picture of two when I get done. My brother in law actually got the Star Destroyer. Not the new "wimpy" one with 300 or so pieces, but the three <i>thousand</i> piece one. Serious legos I tell you.
