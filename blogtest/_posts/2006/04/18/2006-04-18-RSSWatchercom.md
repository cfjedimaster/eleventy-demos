Every now and then I get an email from someone who discovers <a href="http://www.rsswatcher.com">RSSWatcher.com</a>. This is a site I made quite a while ago. The purpose of the site is to search RSS feeds. So for example, I've put in profiles for flex, the PSP, and my name. (Yes, its an <a href="http://www.egoaddict.com">ego tool</a>.) You can associate multiple RSS feeds with a search term so it's a good way to monitor feeds when you are on vacation. 

I just thought I'd remind folks about the tool in case they didn't know it. (And I did some minor behind the scenes updates on it so I thought it was a good time to bring it up.)

p.s. As a side note, I'm loving the preview feature from the <a href="http://www.blogcfc.com">BlogCFC</a> alpha. I tend to make HTML mistakes quite a bit and it catches these immidiately.
