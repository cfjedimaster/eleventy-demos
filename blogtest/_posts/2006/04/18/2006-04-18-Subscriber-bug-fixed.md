I'm currently using the alpha version of <a href="http://www.blogcfc.com">BlogCFC</a> here and someone pointed out that they were not getting emails when a new entry was added. I found a bug in the 5.0 code and have corrected it. I would love it if any subscriber would simply post a comment if they get this entry in email.
