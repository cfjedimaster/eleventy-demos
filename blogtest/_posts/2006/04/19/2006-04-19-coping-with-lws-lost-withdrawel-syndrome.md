So I won't be making my weekly Lost review post tonight since, well, there isn't a new episode of Lost. Being the addicted person I am though I thought I'd at least share a few Lost-related URLs since, well, I can't stop thinking about it even though it isn't on tonight.

First - a <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/eo/20060419/en_tv_eo/18835">spoiler  link</a> - don't follow the link unless you want to know about  a character leaving the show. Personally I was a bit sad to see this character go. 

Secondly - there are a few Lost sites out there, but my favorite is <a href="http://lost.cubit.net/">Sledgeweb's Lost</a>. I mainly like it for the <a href="http://lost.cubit.net/investigations.php">Investigations</a> page, which has a nice listing of the "cool" bits of each show, and stuff you may have missed. For example, I had not seen the logo on Henry Gale's balloon.
