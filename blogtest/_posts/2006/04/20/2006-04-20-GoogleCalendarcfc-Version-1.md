I've updated my GoogleCalendar.cfc. It now correctly (I think) handles time zone offsets and recurrences. I also added a simple way to make it refresh its own cache. 

I think next I'll make a few convenience functions, like getTodaysEvents, getThisMonthsEvents, getThisWeeksEvents. Suggestions are welcome. (And if you use it on your site, let me know!)

The download is attached to this entry. I'll add a project page later on. 

Oh - and I actually included instructions this time, and, thanks to certain events in the past, a license file as well.<p><a href='enclosures/D{% raw %}%3A%{% endraw %}5Cwebsites{% raw %}%5Ccamdenfamily%{% endraw %}5Csource{% raw %}%5Cmorpheus%{% endraw %}5Cblog{% raw %}%5Cenclosures%{% endraw %}2Fgcal1%2Ezip'>Download attached file.</a></p>
