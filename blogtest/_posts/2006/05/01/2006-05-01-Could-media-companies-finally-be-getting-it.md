So I've given the media companies hell before, but could it be that - maybe - they are actually starting to get it? ABC is now offering, for free, <a href="http://dynamic.abc.go.com/streamin">streaming versions</a> of some of their hit shows. I'm sure (or I hope) it will eventually get to a point where you can stream <i>anything</i> from their library, including stupid pilots from the 80s that no one really watched. 

I'm not holding my breath, but maybe this is the beginning of a new age for the network stations. It's funny. I was telling my wife last night that I would have little to no objection to completely giving up "free" tv, since most of it is garbage and I can buy Lost online. On one hand, I'd love to see network tv just die a slow painful death if they refuse to innovate. Now that they may actually be doing so, I'm glad to see it. (Just tell me when I can start streaming the Young and the Restless please.)
