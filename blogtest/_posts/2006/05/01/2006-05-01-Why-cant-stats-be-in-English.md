So I was originally going to start an entry on a cool new "toy" that <a href="http://www.majornelson.com/archive/2006/04/29/Now-your-Xbox-360-can-blog.aspx">translates your XBOX 360 playing habits into a blog</a>. This by itself is fun and kinda cool, but not very useful, but it got me thinking. All this toy is doing is translating your stats into a blog about what you are up to. Why can't we do that with stats in general?

Let me give you an example. Being a stat junkie, I love <a href="http://www.blogbeat.net">Blogbeat</a>. Right now it is telling me this about my blog's traffic:

<blockquote>
up 106.3% over the last 24 hours<br>
up 0.7% over the last 7 days<br>
up 19.7% over the last 30 days <br>
</blockquote>

Now imagine that written like so:

<blockquote>
Your blog is doing much better today compared to yesterday, but in general, the past week hasn't seen much movement. However, over the last month your traffic has increased.
</blockquote>

Wow. Now isn't that a heck of a lot more simply then showing increases in percentiles? Can't you imagine your clients just loving a stat report in that format? And since you have the original numbers, you could please both the "pointy-haired" manager as well as the stat addicts. 

Now imagine this coming in via RSS to a client managing ten sites. Instead of seeing a bunch of numbers, they can instead see a nice, friendly, almost folksy description of his sites in a simple to read report. 

Most of my audience are techs, but I'd like to try something. If you have a moment, show both examples above to non-techies and see which one they prefer. 

p.s. I may consider something like this for BlogCFC, and if so, I'll write more about it. I can imagine writing a UDF that translates stuff like 33{% raw %}% higher to "better" and 120%{% endraw %} higher to "much better".
