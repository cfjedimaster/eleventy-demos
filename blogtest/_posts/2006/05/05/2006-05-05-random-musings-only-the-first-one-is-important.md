I fixed a bug with <a href="http://www.blogcfc.com">BlogCFC 5</a> where subscriber data wasn't being saved. If you tried to subscribe in the last week, you may not have been. Sign up again. If you already are subscribed and do it again, you won't get subscribed twice.

Still here? I did warn you this wasn't unimportant. Of course, it wouldn't be my blog if I didn't talk about Lost at least once. I must have been the last person to know about <a href="http://www.jayandjack.com/">The Lost Podcast</a>. I'm listening to it now and it's pretty good. I definitely agree with their assertion that "Henry" is the best thing on the show now. They also have a dang good <a href="http://jayandjack.com/wiki/index.php?title=The_Lost_Experience">wiki</a> on the Lost Experience.

You can now also buy a novel from one of the Lost castaways: "Bad Twin", written by Gary Troup. The story was mentioned in the last episode. We saw Sawyer reading it and he was anxious to see how it ended. I've added it to my wishlist since, well, I can't <i>not</i> feed my Lost addiction.

Last but not least - the past year has been "medical" year for me. I'm not in great shape. I'm overweight. I don't exercise, but in general I'm healthy. (Please, no comments. I <i>know</i> I need to exercise.) But for some reason, the last year has been wacky. First I had the <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2005/9/9/Poison-Ivy-2-Ray-0">Poison Ivy Attack</a> back last September, which I had no idea I even knew was possible. Then back in January I <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2006/1/24/A-Farewell-to-Arms">hurt my arm</a> by tearing a rotator cuff. Something else I didn't know I had.

Now I'm fighting a cough. I've had it for two weeks and a few nights ago had some chest pain when coughing. I gave up and went to the Doc in the Box and turns out I had a bronchial infection. I got a cortisone shot (which I got the last two times I went to a doctor) and 3 prescriptions. I am feeling <i>much</i> better today.  I'm still coughing a bit, but most of the pain is gone.
