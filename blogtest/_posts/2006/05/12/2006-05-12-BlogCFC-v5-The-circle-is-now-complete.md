I'm happy to announce the immediate availability of BlogCFC 5.0. This has been a long time coming. In fact, the last release was January 22nd. So what has changed? Here is a short list:

<ul>
<li>New default look and feel.
<li>Administrator (no more design mode)
<li>CAPTCHA support
<li>Auto-include images
<li>RSS improvements
<li>Related Entries support
<li>Comment display improvements
<li>SES improvements
<li>Cowbell improvements
<li>Preview support
<li>Draft mode support
<li>Send to a Friend
<li>Lots of bug fixes
</ul>

First and foremost, I want to thank Scott Stroz, Jeff Coughlin, and Charlie Griefer. Scott added the "Pure CSS" changes to the front end, and helped all around in general. JC and CG built thew Related Entries support from the ground up. Their wishlists are mentioned in the readme doc. If you have supported me before and want to do so again, I ask that you please support them first. Of course, I won't mind if you visit <a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/registry/2TCL1D08EZEYE">my list</a>. ;)

I will continue to work on BlogCFC of course. The plans for 5.1 are Postgres and AJAX changed to Related Entries. My next area of focus though will be on CFLib and Soundings. (Yes, Next-N is coming in.) Oh, and I start a new job on Monday as well, so things may be a bit crazy. :)

As always, you can expect a few.... issues to crop up. You may want to monitor the <a href="http://www.blogcfc.com">BlogCFC</a> web site and the Subversion repository. 

Enjoy.
