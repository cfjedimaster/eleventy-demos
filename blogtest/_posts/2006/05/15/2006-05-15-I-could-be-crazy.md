Those of you who know me, and know me well, know that I'm not the most exciting guy in the world. In fact, I'm very much an old fuddy-duddy at times, and that is just fine. I like things simple. I like thins consistent. I don't like change. (And yes, I know change is good.) 

Today is a huge day for me. It is my first day at <a href="http://www.roundpeg.com">roundpeg</a>. I also told my wife to "have her way" with my office. And a few seconds ago I just purchased my Macbook Pro. (Which, in theory, will be here on the 23rd.)

So yes - I must be crazy to be doing all of this at once. And yes - my stomach is doing flips in multiple dimensions at once, but at the same time... I'm loving it.
