Google has released (yet another) free service, the <a href="http://www.google.com/notebook/">Google Notebook</a>. It is a research type tool allowing you to save clips from various web sites into a notebook. I'm not quite sure how useful it is, but it seems handy. 

I'm building a notebook for <a href="http://www.google.com/notebook/public/05549208375696116763/BDT7kIgoQrNaGkLQh">ColdFusion</a>, which I've shared and may be useful to others (once I get content in). It appears though that I can't let others add to the notebook, which is unfortunate. If multiple people could add to the notebook, it could turn out like digg or del.ioc.us.<p><a href='enclosures/D{% raw %}%3A%{% endraw %}5Cwebsites{% raw %}%5Ccamdenfamily%{% endraw %}5Csource{% raw %}%5Cmorpheus%{% endraw %}5Cblog{% raw %}%5Cenclosures%{% endraw %}2Fgoogle{% raw %}%5Fnotebook%{% endraw %}2Egif'>Download attached file.</a></p>
