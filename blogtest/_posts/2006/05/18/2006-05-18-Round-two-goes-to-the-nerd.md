I've been following the case for a while, and I'm happy to see that Manning, Jr. <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2449810">has been charged</a> with assault. He will probably get off, but I hope he rots in jail. 

For those who don't know, a few weeks back these jerks beat up some poor media-described nerd who dared to be using a laptop at Denny's. (Although I thought we were at the point where laptops didn't automatically make you a nerd?)

As I said, he will probably get off, and at the end of the day, if you beat someone up it isn't the same as rape or murder, but I'd still like to see Manning, and his partners in crime, actually spend a few days in jail. (With a corresponding dock in the huge salary he gets.)
