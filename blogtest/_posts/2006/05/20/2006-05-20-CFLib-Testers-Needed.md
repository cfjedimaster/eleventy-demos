If you are bored on this fine Saturday afternoon, please take a look at the MG version of CFLib set up here:

<blockquote>
<a href="http://mg.cflib.org">http://mg.cflib.org</a>
</blockquote>

I need testers to play with the user system only. Register - make mistakes - log on - make mistakes - etc. The password reminder system works as well.

If this works well, then I have a bit more cleanup to do on the front end, and then I dive into the admin, and then CFLib will go live with CFCs and custom tags added to the library.

<b>Edited:</b> I forgot to mention. This is JUST testing. Your username will be nuked later on.
