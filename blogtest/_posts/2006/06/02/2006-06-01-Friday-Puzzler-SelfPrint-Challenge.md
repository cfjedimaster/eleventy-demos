First off, sorry for the lack of a challenge last Friday. I don't even remember why I didn't have one, but hopefully today's will make up for it.

Today's challenge is simple. Really! Write a program that, when executed, will display it's own source code. Here's the catch though - you can't use cffile or any other file operation. 

This idea isn't mine - I read about programs like this a few weeks ago. I think they even have a name - but right now I can't find it on Google.

Good luck!
