Adobe has released some initial <a href="http://www.adobe.com/events/max/">MAX</a> info. If by some chance you have no idea what MAX it - it was Macromedia/Allaire's main development conference. Adobe is running things now so it should be interesting to see how it works this year. Only a few details are known now:

Place: The Venetian, Las Vegas, Nevada<br>
Date: October 23-26, 2006

But you can sign up for email updates. 

I got in from Detroit last night, and as I have a few hundred emails, please forgive me if I need a little time (few weeks?) to respond. I do have some interesting news though. People who weren't exactly thrilled with my last ColdFusion contest should watch this blog carefully over the next few days.
