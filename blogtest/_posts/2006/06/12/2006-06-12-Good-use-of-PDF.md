Ok, so I don't talk much about PDF because, probably like most of you, I just don't think about it. PDF is just how forms are done (mostly). Today my wife brought me a list of forms I had to print out for my son's new school. It was quite a list - a good ten forms or so. I anticipated a lot of: click, print, back, repeat.

However - the school did something intelligent. They put all 10 forms in one PDF. All I had to do was load and print. 

I know I'm making a big deal of something simple, but I haven't seen that before and I thought it was nice.
