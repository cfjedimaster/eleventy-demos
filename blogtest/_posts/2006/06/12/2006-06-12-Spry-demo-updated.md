A few days ago I blogged about the update to <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/spry/">Spry</a>. I've updated my demo. You can see two AJAX-ified Blog demos:

<a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/spry/blog.cfm">Demo 1</a> is the same as the last one. View source to see how the mark up has changed.

<a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/spry/blog2.cfm">Demo 2</a> is a slightly more powerful demo. It lets you sort the results (although date sorting is broken now). 

Also - both demos now call the CFC directly. Thanks to the tip from Mike Nimer, I'm now using a returnType of XML in my CFC files. I've packaged everything up into a zip. You can download the code by clicking the Download link below. I did not include the Spry JavaScript libraries however. You can download them from the <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/spry/">site</a>.

All in all - I continue to be extremely impressed with <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/spry/">Spry</a>.<p><a href='enclosures/D{% raw %}%3A%{% endraw %}5Cwebsites{% raw %}%5Ccamdenfamily%{% endraw %}5Csource{% raw %}%5Cmorpheus%{% endraw %}5Cblog{% raw %}%5Cenclosures%{% endraw %}2Fspry%2Ezip'>Download attached file.</a></p>
