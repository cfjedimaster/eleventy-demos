I am <b>very</b> happy to announce that the <a href="http://www.coldfusioncookbook.com">ColdFusion Cookbook</a> has hit 100 entries! While I built the site, about 90 of those 100 entries were published by <a href="http://www.petersenfam.com/jeremy/">Jeremy Petersen</a>. The PDF is now almost the size of a "real" book, and I think that is something to be proud of.
