The title says it all. You can now get the <a href="http://www.model-glue.com/index.cfm?mode=entry&entry=D5815F2A-3048-55C9-432B8F55F7D81A87">beta 1</a> version of Model-Glue 2. I've been playing with it already and I'm very happy with that I see so far. I'm working on a very large project in my free time (did you notice the lack of updates to my released projects) and it is using Model-Glue 2. Along with new features, Joe finally wrote some good documentation. (I think he got tired of me complaining!)
