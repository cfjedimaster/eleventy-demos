This blog post is mostly for me so I don't forget, but here is an excellent tool for migrating from SQL Server to MySQL: <a href="http://www.kofler.cc/mysql/mssql2mysql.html">MSSQL2MySQL</a>.  The only drawback is that you need MS Office or VB installed to run the script. I still have MS Office on my desktop, but I don't use it anymore. I'm completely on OpenOffice now. (Except on the Mac - I'm still using Office there till OpenOffice for the Mac gets improved.)
