Another set of updates to <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/projects/canvas">CanvasWiki</a>:

<ul>
<li>Add Page: A simple form to add a new page. While not necessary (you can make a new page by just linking to it), this will make it easier for folks.
<li>Search: You can search the wiki now. Only searches the most current pages.
<li>I "reverted" some of the SQL to the more advanced form. This should work in SQL Server 2000 (where I tested) and MySQL 5, but probably not Access. 
</ul>

As always, if you like what you see, take a gander at my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/registry/2TCL1D08EZEYE">wish list</a>. 

Enjoy.
