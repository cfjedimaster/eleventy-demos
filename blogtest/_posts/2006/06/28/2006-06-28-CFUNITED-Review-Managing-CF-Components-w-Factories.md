Not much to say here outside of that fact that it was an excellent presentation by Sean Corfield. If there are folks reading my blog who are attending, you should try to attend this on Saturday. It talked about the problems of dependancies between CFCs and configuration. He talked about ColdSpring and how this can help. I've never really used ColdSpring. It was something I knew I needed to learn more about (like Reactor), and now I'm definitely convinced. 

p.s. I absolutely love iChat and the video conferencing feature. I just spent a half hour with my wife and kids and it was amazing. Much better then simple phone calls. (I have the Macbook Pro, my wife has the Macbook, and both come with built-in video cameras.)
