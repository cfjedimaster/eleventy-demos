I'm a bit late on this - but at CFUNITED, the Fusion Authority Quarterly Update was released. This is a new ColdFusion (only) trade publication written and produced by Michael and Judith Dinowitz. They are giving the first issue away for free at the conference, but you can subscribe for 49.95 a year. More details may be found <a href="http://www.fusionauthority.com/News/4628-New-ColdFusion-Technical-Journal-Released-at-CFUNITED.htm">here</a>.

Yours truly has an article on Application.cfc in the issue. Other authors include Matt Woodward, Kay Smoljak, Doug Boude, and others. 

I really think it is worth checking out. I'm not sure how folks who aren't at the conference can get a copy though.
