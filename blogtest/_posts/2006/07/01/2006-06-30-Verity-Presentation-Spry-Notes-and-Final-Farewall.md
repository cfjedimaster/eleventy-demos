I've attached the Verity presentation to this blog entry. I added entryDAO.cfc to the zip. This is code from the <a href="http://www.coldfusioncookbook.com">ColdFusion Cookbook</a> that demonstrates "real" use of Verity. You will see two Verity related functions in the CFC. The "calls" to these functions are done in the controller file run by Model-Glue.

For those who met me in the Spry class run by Kelly - I promised some more Spry stuff but I decided to sleep last night instead. ;) I'm planning on:

<ul>
<li>Updating my queryToXML UDF to reside in a CFC that will also include arrayToXML and listToXML. (And shoot, why not structToXML as well.)
<li>I've been meaning to write a demo showing how Spry can auto refresh itself at a specific interval. I also plan on showing how you can send content back via Spry, not just read it. 
<li>If I get time, I'll show an example of how Spry degrades. This <i>does</i> exist in the Spry documentation, but I figure a demo won't hurt, right readers?
</ul>

So - it is now 2:31 AM. I got a grand total of 4 hours of sleep last night. I woke up at 2 so I could catch a cab at 3 to Reagan for a 6 AM flight. All I can say now is that my brain is definitely running on about half-CPU now. It was <b>awesome</b> to see everyone. CFUNITED really came off well I think, and I hope to see even more people next year. I also want to thank everyone who came up and said hello!<p><a href='enclosures/D{% raw %}%3A%{% endraw %}5Cwebsites{% raw %}%5Ccamdenfamily%{% endraw %}5Csource{% raw %}%5Cmorpheus%{% endraw %}5Cblog{% raw %}%5Cenclosures%{% endraw %}2Fcfunited06verity%2Ezip'>Download attached file.</a></p>
