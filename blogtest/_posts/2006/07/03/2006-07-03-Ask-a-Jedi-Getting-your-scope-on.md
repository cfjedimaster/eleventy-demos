Justin asks...

<blockquote>
I am a programmer coming from a background of php and ruby on rails and I need to find a place to get some info on scopes.  I have heard a lot mentioned about the different scopes while at cfunited this year, but I don't really know what the basic scopes are or what is appropriate in them.  Any good resources for learning about this kind of thing?

First off, welcome to a real programming language. (<b>Kidding!</b>) While I haven't used Ruby, I've used PHP a bit, and while I definitely prefer ColdFusion, PHP is probably what I would use if I didn't have access to CF. Anyway, your best bet for such problems is always the documentation. You can read the docs online for CF7 at <a href="http://livedocs.macromedia.com">livedocs.macromedia.com</a>. For your specific question, check this resource:

<blockquote>
<a href="http://livedocs.macromedia.com/coldfusion/7/htmldocs/00000912.htm#1123172">Scope types</a>
</blockquote>

This is a nice table that covers just about everything you need to know. 

ColdFusion lets address scopes without fully qualifying them. I don't believe the order of look up is in the docs, but Yacoblog has a nice page describing the order here:
