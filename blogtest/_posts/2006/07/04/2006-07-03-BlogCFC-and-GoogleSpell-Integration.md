The fine folks over at RedBallon Labs (I need a cool name like that) have written a series of articles on integrating BlogCFC and GoogleSpell. You can start <a href="http://labs.redbd.net/blog/index.cfm/2006/7/4/BlogCFC-and-GoogieSpell-Intergration-Explained">here</a> and work yourself backwards through the Related Entries list.

This is pretty cool. I use the Google Toolbar myself, but this can come back to bite you when you aren't on your own machine. Luckily my speling is near perfect so I need not worry about it. 

RedBalloon's article would also be of interest to <i>anyone</i> wanting to add some spelling tools to their web applications, so check it out.
