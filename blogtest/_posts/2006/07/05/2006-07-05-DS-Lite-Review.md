Is it DSLite? DSlite? No idea. Anyway, before my trip to CFUNITED, I decided to pick up a DS Lite. I never purchased the DS as it seemed like a waste of time. I mean, yes, Nintendo knows how to make a handheld, but they seemed very... coy about the DS. It was <b>not</b> their "new" handheld to replace the Gameboy. Rather, it was "another" handheld. Sure it played the same games, but from a marketing perspective it really gave me the heebie-jeebies. One company working on two different handhelds at the same time seems risky, even if that company has a proven track record in the area.

What pushed this decision for me was a few things. First, my wife stole my PSP. Yes, she stole it. She got addicted to Lumines and the Namco pack. Then my son got addicted. That left me without a handled. Secondly, I saw the New Super Mario Brothers. It was both fun and a unique new version of the classic. Since the Lite was a refined version of the DS, I thought it was a good time to jump back on the Nintendo bandwagon. 

The unit is a bit weird to hold at first - mainly since I was more used to the PSP. The screen isn't as good as the PSP, but it is darn close. I'd rather watch a movie on the PSP, but game wise, I think both are about equal. What is nice is that even GBA games seem crisper and much brighter. 

I picked up Animal Crossing, which is... different. Not the game I'd normally pick up, but I figured what the heck, why not. I haven't played it a lot actually, but so far it's fun. A bit cutesy, but hey, I don't need to shoot Nazis all the time. I'm also playing Mario Cart (fun!) and a few old GBA games. 

The one thing I don't like so far is the sound. The quality is fine, but the volume is much lower than what the PSP can put out. I could hear it on the airplane, but not very well.
