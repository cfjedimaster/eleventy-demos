I have two upcoming speaking engagements I want to mention, as well as to let people know that I am available to present to your user group (or business I guess) as long as you give me a good 2-3 week warning. I've been doing this off and on lately and I've decided to create a page with my speaking engagements when I release the new design for the blog. So - in the mean time - if you would like to have me speak at your organization, just drop me an email. As I said, I would normally need 2-3 weeks of warning. It needs to be at night, roughly 6PM CST, and obviously over a Breeze account you would set up. I'm not going to do more than 2 a month, so it's first come first serve. 

Anyway - my next presentation will be a Spry presentation for the <a href="http://www.gotoandstop.org/meetings.htm">Flash and Multimedia Users Group of Arizona</a> on July 26. It will be on Spry and I'll focus on hooking it up with ColdFusion.

The second presentation will be to the <a href="http://www.statelinemmug.com/">Stateline Adobe User Group</a>. It will be on September 14th. The group is pretty light on ColdFusion so I'm doing a basic ColdFusion overview. Marketing essentially. I should get paid for this. :) Anyway, most of my readers probably would <i>not</i> be interested in that, but I do love to show off the tool I know and I love.
