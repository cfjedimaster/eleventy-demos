Charlie Arehart has created a great <a href="http://carehart.org/spry/spry_resources.cfm">Spry Resources</a> page. Check it out. My readers know I'm having quite a passionate love affair with Spry. I have an article or two in mind for later blog postings, so someone slap me if I don't get them up soon. Also, for those who don't follow the updates at <a href="http://www.blogcfc.com">BlogCFC</a>, I'm currently working on version 5.1. One of the updates will be the use of Spry to handle the "Related Entries" function.
