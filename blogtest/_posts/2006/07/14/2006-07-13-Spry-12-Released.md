Adobe's AJAX framework, <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/spry/">Spry</a>, was updated last night to version 1.2. This is still a pre-release but it has some pretty cool new features. From the changelog:

<ul>
<li>Spry is now compatible with frameworks based on Prototype 1.5 rc0 or later.
<li>A spry:state control now makes it easy to use messages like "Loading" when your data is being sucked in.
<li>A new debugger which lets you see your dynamic regions and how they can get translated by the remote data.
<li>Documentation and updates to the Accordion control.
<li>Bug fixes and more.
</ul>

For a full list, please see the changelog included in the <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/go/labs_spry_download">download</a>. I'll try to upload a demo or two later in the day to show off some of the new features.
