I've been meaning to see Superman since it came out, but I didn't get a chance till this weekend. The whole family went along with my wife's sister and her family. All in all we make a small army, but hey, that's all good.

From the very beginning I absolutely loved the movie. It both referenced the old movies and charted a new course for the character, much like Batman Begins. Unlike Batman Begins, which was very good as well, Superman was much less dark and just plain fun to watch. Kevin Spacey makes an absolutely perfect Luthor, and I'm glad they didn't kill him off. (But I'll stop here, I don't want to reveal any spoilers.)
