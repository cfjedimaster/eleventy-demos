I've released version 1.6.001 of <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/projects/galleon/">Galleon Forums</a> this morning. It fixes a few small issues. One relates to a bug that would occur when editing users and email confirmation is turned off. The other involved people who dared to install the application in a folder I didn't approve. (Bad end users!) As usual, it can be downloaded from the <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/projects/galleon/">project page</a>.
