Gee, I bet you thought that since the season was over I'd stop blogging about Lost? Sucker! Tom Mollerus sent me a link over at EW about some possible big changes coming up for Lost:

The article focuses on the Lost Experience, the online game that, I have to admit, I've fallen behind on. No big details are revealed in the article, but it is well worth a read.
