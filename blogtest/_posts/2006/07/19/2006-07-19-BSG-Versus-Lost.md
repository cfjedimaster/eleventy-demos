Ok, it's not really a Battlestar Galactica versus Lost post, but I did have two things to share.

First is the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz1W7m_1E4s">trailer</a> for season 3 of Battlestar Galactica. BSG is due to return in October, which seems like a long time, but, lets face it, compared to Sopranos the time frame is practically minuscule. (Am I the only one who thinks this whole 'Wait 16 months for Sopranos' thing is just crap? I mean - I get it's an art to make good TV - but come on. I barely even remember the end of this "half season". Not that it was bad, but it was a bad way to end with so many months to wait.)

Second is a <a href="http://mapgallery.esri.com/2006/414/85121816138512.jpg">Lost poster</a> that is pretty interesting. Warning - this file is huge.
