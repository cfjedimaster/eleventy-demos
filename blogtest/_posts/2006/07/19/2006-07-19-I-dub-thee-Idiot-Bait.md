So after reading an <a href="http://www.markdrew.co.uk/blog/index.cfm/2006/7/19/Strange-but-true">entry</a> on Mark Drew's blog, I eventually ended up on a <a href="http://weblogs.macromedia.com/jd/archives/2003/01/instantet_the_e.cfm">post</a> at John Dowdell's blog that is absolutely hilarious. 

I think we need a new term for blog posts that somehow seem to be a draw for users who can't read: Idiot Bait. 

I used to get a lot of freaky mail when I ran <a href="http://www.deathclock.com">Death Clock</a>, but at least they were <b>on topic</b>. At least folks knew what they were complaining about. I'm shocked the readers on JD's post even know how to type.
