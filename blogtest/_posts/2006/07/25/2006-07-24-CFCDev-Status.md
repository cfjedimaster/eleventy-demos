I just wanted to give folks a quick update on CFCDev. I think about one hour after I asked for a corporate sponsor on cf-talk, the fine folks at <a href="http://www.katapultmedia.com">Katapult Media</a> purchased a copy of SmarterMail. Unfortunately, no amount of corporate sponsorship can give me time, so while I've had the license since Monday morning, I haven't yet had chance to actually set it up. My plan is to do this Saturday morning. (So if you are a cfcdev users and around on Saturday, post here and I'll add a comment when I start testing.)

Again, I apologize for the delay. Until I get a job just writing ColdFusion apps, these things will have to wait. :)
