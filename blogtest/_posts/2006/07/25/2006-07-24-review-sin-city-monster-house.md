So, I'm probably the last person to get around to seeing Sin City. It was wishlisted to me a few weeks ago and I finally made time to sit down and watch it. I have to say - this movie more than makes up for the director shoving "Shark Boy and Lava Girls" onto the world. This is easily one of the best films I've seen in a long time. The visual style is amazing and really brings the comic to life. I loved the different stories and how they worked together. I was reminded quite a bit of Pulp Fiction when watching it. 

Speaking of Pulp Fiction - if you think it was a bit violent, this movie will probably be a bit too much. I think the only thing more violent than Sin City is Kill Bill, and even then it's a pretty tight race. 

I haven't yet read the Sin City comic, but I plan to. The DVD that I got (and the one linked to above) has a graphic novel with it. The author of the comic, Frank Miller, is one of the best writers out there and created what is probably the best Batman stories ever created.

On the flip side of Sin City. Our family went to see Monster House this weekend, and really enjoyed it. It was much better than Cars. The story was more interesting, the design of the animation was better, it was just all around fun to see, although I'm surprised they didn't wait till October to release it.
