If you are bored tonight (and with no Lost on, you must be), I'll be giving a presentation on Spry tonight to the <a href="http://www.gotoandstop.org/meetings.htm">Flash and Multimedia Users Group of Arizona</a>. It's listed as a two hour preso but should only be an hour. The time is 8:30 CST and I've been told everyone and the world can attend via Breeze.
