Mark Andracheck has written a <a href="http://webmages.com/cfmxIntelOSXguide.html">guide</a> to getting CF running correctly on Intel Macs. I haven't tried his method myself (I've already got mine running and there is no way I'm going to touch it), but for those who want to try setting it up, you may want to check his site out.
