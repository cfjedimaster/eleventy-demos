I got the mail server running early this morning, and while I'm not 100% sure things are ok, I think they are almost there.

Unfortunately, the Mail Enable to SmarterMail importer did not get the listserv. 

So my question is: I can probably get the listserv back up in 5 minutes, but you would need to resign up. Should I do that just to get the list back, or should I keep trying to find a way to import the old users?
