So, in case it isn't yet quite obvious, I've changed the UI for the blog, and have upgraded to the latest version of <a href="http://www.blogcfc.com">BlogCFC</a>. I am <i>very</i> about this for a few reasons:

<ul>
<li>I love the liquid design. All my screens tend to be wide screen so I like how the content spreads out.
<li>I was often updating small files here and there on my site. Now with BlogCFC 5.1, I don't have to. I can use the pages and textblock features to do it via the web. It's called eating your own dog food, and you know what, it tastes good.
</ul>

Unfortunately, my Subscriber list was 99% spammer. So I deleted the entire list. Sorry guys. I do ask that my loyal readers please re-sign up using the Subscribe pod to the right. You will have to confirm your subscription, but this is a one time change.

Enjoy.
