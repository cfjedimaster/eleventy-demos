I typically like to answer questions, but every now and then I'll just pass them on. Being a CFEclipse guy and knowing next to nothing about Dreamweaver, I thought I'd pass along this cry for help:

<blockquote>
We have an IIS virtual directory on our site containing
global images, css, js, etc that's used across many sites.  However, in Dreamweaver, when the user is designing, it doesn't seem to be able to recognize the virtual directory.  This is causing my boss all sorts of heartburn as he
develops his little HTML pages with the WYSIWYG.  Since it's not working for him, he's all over me for a solution, which I have yet to find.
</blockquote>

Outside of this specific question, would folks recommend any Dreaweaver sites or blogs? Is there a Dreamweaver Jedi Master out there?
