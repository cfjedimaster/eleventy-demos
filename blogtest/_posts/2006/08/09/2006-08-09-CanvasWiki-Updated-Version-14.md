I've updated <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/projects/canvas">CanvasWiki</a> tonight with a few small changes. The big change is a simple modification to how I display titles. The wiki asks you to name pages like so:

Main.Products.Servers.ColdFusion_Server

This represents a page for named ColdFusion_Server under a Servers section, which is under a Products section, and lastly which is under a Main section.

And that is exactly how it was displayed. Now I simply change the periods to pipes and replace underscores with spaces. A small change, but it really makes a difference.

There is now an Oracle script provided by John Keir.

There are a few other small changes as well, documented in the readme, and yes, I know I need to get a demo online. So I've done it. You can find a demo of the wiki <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/demos/canvas">here</a>. Let's please try to be mature and not go crazy with the edits. ;)
