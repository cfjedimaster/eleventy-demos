For the past week or so Ted Patrick (Adobe's Flex Evangelist) has been sharing a cool little project with me. Today it went live: 

<a href="http://www.onflex.org/FXT/">FXT - Flex Templating</a>

From the site....

<blockquote>
This is an implementation of client side templating using Flex. It is a very compatible and productive way to make data driven websites very quickly. The custom Yahoo Web Search mashup took less than an hour to create and the entire UI can be reskinned by changing a single SWF file.
</blockquote>

This is a pretty darn powerful tool here and folks should check it out. Be sure to view source on the examples as well. I've never seen &lt;script type="text/xml"&gt; in use before. (To be honest, I've never seen it at all!)
