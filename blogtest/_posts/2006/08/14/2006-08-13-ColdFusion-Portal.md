If you haven't yet seen <a href="http://www.flex.org">Flex.org</a>, you should check it out. It is a great idea. All the Flex resources in one nice web page. It is such a good idea I thought I'd pull a Microsoft and "innovate" a version for ColdFusion. I don't have a fancy short URL for it, but here is my version:

<blockquote>
<a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/demos/cfportal">ColdFusion Resource Portal</a>
</blockquote>

If you have any suggestions, send them my way, but I don't want to add much more. Right now the content fits well on one page. In case you are wondering, the pods on the right (except for Sites) are being driven by Spry.
