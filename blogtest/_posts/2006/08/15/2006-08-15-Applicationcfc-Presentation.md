As a member of the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/communities/experts/">Adobe Community Expert</a> group, I'm given access to Adobe Breeze. While I'm currently preparing for a few upcoming <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/speakingengagements.cfm">speaking engagements</a>, I thought I'd try out the Breeze account Adobe is sharing with me.

With that in mind - can I get a show of hands from people who <i>think</i> they could attend a meeting at the end of this month, let's say August 30th, at night, let's say around 6PM, on the topic of Application.cfc. 

This is not firm, but I'm interested in see who could possibly show up. If this works, I may start doing a monthly presentation (can I call it the Jedi User Group without being sued by Lucas?) on various topics.
