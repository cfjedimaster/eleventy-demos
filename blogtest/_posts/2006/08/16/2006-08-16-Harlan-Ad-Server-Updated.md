It's been a few months, but I've updated my ColdFusion based ad server, <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/projects/harlan">Harlan</a>. The changes include:

<ul>
<li>Fix IE issues. IE sucks. I hate IE. Have I said that IE sucks?
<li>When deleting an ad from a campaign, I was resetting all of the stats for all ads in the campaign. Now I only remove the stats for that ad.
<li>On the logon form, auto-focus on the username. Charlie suggested that in BlogCFC, and I'm trying to do that to all my applications now.
</ul>

Version 1.02 can be downloaded from the <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/projects/harlan">project page</a>.
