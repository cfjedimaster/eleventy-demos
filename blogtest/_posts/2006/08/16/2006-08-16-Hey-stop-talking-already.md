So the last 4 or 5 posts have been about me talking, and I swear, in real life, I'm quiet like heck. I wanted to point out that I have also scheduled another user group meeting, this one in November for the Hartford, CT group. This will be a repeat of my Spry presentation, obviously updated to handle 1.3 features. (Or 1.4 if they have it out by then.)

I finally got around to adding a project page for the code that drives my <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/speakingengagements.cfm">speaking engagements</a> page: <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/projects/googlecal/">GoogleCal</a>. GoogleCal is a CFC that lets you read events from Google's calendar service. The next version will let you add events as well. Maybe if I get lucky Google will be kind enough to include my code in their examples, but I have yet to find a good contact at the mother ship.
