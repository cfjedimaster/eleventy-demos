I wish I had seen this when I posted my earlier <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2006/8/24/FlexTV">entry</a>. Adobe is offering <a href="http://www.adobereg.com/flex2&coldfusion/">free seminars</a> on Flex and ColdFusion (it's like peanut butter and chocolate). These are on site sessions in Chicago, Boston, New York, and San Francisco. (What, no Lafayette?!?!) You have to register for the session so if you plan on attending, I'd recommend signing up now.
