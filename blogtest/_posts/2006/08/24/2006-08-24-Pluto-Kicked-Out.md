CNN is <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/TECH/space/08/24/pluto.ap/index.html">reporting</a> that Pluto will no longer be considered a planet. Our solar system of 9 will now be 8. 32 milliseconds after the announcement, multiple California lawyers announced they are opening up a suit on behalf of Pluto to return it's status. Pluto could not be reached for comment, but a statement was released from his manager:

<blockquote>
"Obviously we are very disappointed with the decision of the International Astronomical Union and will vigorously defend our right to participation in the Solar System."
