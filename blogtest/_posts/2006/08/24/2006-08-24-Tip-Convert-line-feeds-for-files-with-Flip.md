Someone sent me files today that didn't have the right line feed type. (By "right" I mean what I expected. ;) A quick Google search turned up <a href="http://ccrma-www.stanford.edu/~craig/utility/flip/">flip</a>, a utility for Win/Max/Unix that lets you quickly convert the line feeds in a file. I was able to detect the line feeds she had used - and what I had used (really, I had no idea), and then convert her files to the proper format.
