This is just a reminder, but Wednesday night at 6PM Central I'll be giving a presentation on Application.CFC. This is a class for beginners who have not yet had a chance to learn this cool new feature of ColdFusion MX 7. As I mentioned before, I am <i>considering</i> a monthly presentation via Breeze, so this may become a regular meeting for me.
