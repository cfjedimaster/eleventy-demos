I found this a few weeks ago, and I thought I'd share it with folks. In your Eclipse navigator, if you right click on a folder and select, "Go Into", the navigator will reload with only that folder being available. This is an excellent way to quickly hide the rest of the navigator. It's also useful for presentations. I tend to find myself searching for files (no matter how well I document ahead of time), and restricting Eclipse to a subset helps narrow the search.
