My local paper ran a story today entitled, <a href="http://www.acadiananow.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060903/NEWS01/609030333/1002">They make what?</a>. It covered what our public officials are getting paid. (Although to be fair, it should cover all the benefits they get.) Unfortunately, the most interesting article doesn't exist on the web site. Apparently the one local government agency that wouldn't respond to the FOI request was our airport.

Get this.

Apparently the job titles and salaries of the airport officials is a matter of national security. The paper was sent a list of names and job titles, but they were not connected. Salaries were not sent. The airport is checking with Homeland Security even though the law clearly states that they should have responded to the paper properly.

What is sad is that the job title information is readily available on the <a href="http://www.lftairport.com/">web site</a>. 

So - nothing too exciting here I guess. Just one more sign of the new world we live in.
