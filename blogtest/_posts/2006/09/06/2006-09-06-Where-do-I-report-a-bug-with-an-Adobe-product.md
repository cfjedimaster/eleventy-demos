I talked about this a few months ago, but it came up again today in conversation so I thought I'd remind folks. As we all know, ColdFusion is perfect and has no bugs and is the best programming language on the planet. If, however, you do not agree with that and think you have a bug (inconceivable!), you can report a bug here:

<a href="http://www.adobe.com/go/wish">http://www.adobe.com/go/wish</a>

You can also use this link for other Adobe products, but it seems as if they only list the old Macromedia products. I didn't see Photoshop listed for example. You can also use this page to make requests as well. (ColdFusion needs more cow bell!)
