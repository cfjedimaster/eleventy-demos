YouTube has a video which reveals the secrets behind <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PPCCcXarkc">Dharma</a>. This can be considered a big spoiler, although to be honest, it doesn't actually answer <i>everything</i>. Personally, I'm pretty psyched about what this video reveals, but I've been a Lost addict since day one anyway. I'm definitely not surprised by the revelation that Dharma had good intentions, especially after the "We're the good guys" comment at the end of season two.
