This is mainly for those who use my products. I want everyone to know that this week is very, very bad for me. In general, if you have a support question, and you <b>can</b> wait, I ask that you do so, until the beginning of next week. I apologize, but I'm busy night and day now to fix an issue so I will not be able to help. Obviously my blogging volume is going to be much lower than normal. I am still giving my presentation this week (two actually, but one is for my local user group), but the presentation I'm giving later in the week is an intro to CF thing that will not really be of interest to most folks.
