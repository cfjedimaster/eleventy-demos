Anyone else just not terribly excited about iTunes selling movies? Without getting into a huge DRM discussion, I can say I'm very happy with the prices for songs, and the TV show prices seemed fair as well. But 9.99 for an old DVD that I can get at Walmart (for probably cheaper), and 14.99 for a new movie? Wow. I'm just really surprised.
