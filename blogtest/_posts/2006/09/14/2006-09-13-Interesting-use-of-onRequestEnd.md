Andrew pointed me to an <a href="http://www.andyscott.id.au/index.cfm/2006/9/12/Proof-of-Concept">article</a> on his blog where he discusses an interesting use of the onRequestEnd method of the Application.cfc file. He is very clear in pointing out that it is just a proof of concept, but it is still definitely worth a read.
