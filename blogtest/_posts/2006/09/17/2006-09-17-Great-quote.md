It's Sunday, so I'll continue my trend of inane useless posts. I'm currently reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http{% raw %}%3A%{% endraw %}2F{% raw %}%2Fwww.amazon.com%{% endraw %}2FYear-Our-War-Steph-Swainston{% raw %}%2Fdp%{% endraw %}2F0060753870{% raw %}%2Fsr%{% endraw %}3D8-1{% raw %}%2Fqid%{% endraw %}3D1158549350{% raw %}%2Fref%{% endraw %}3Dpd{% raw %}%5Fbbs%{% endraw %}5F1{% raw %}%3Fie%{% endraw %}3DUTF8{% raw %}%26s%{% endraw %}3Dbooks&tag=raymondcamden-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">The Year of Our War</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=raymondcamden-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />. It is a pretty good book so far. I'm not quite sure if I actually like it - but it is definitely interesting and unique. A night ago I came across a line that I thought was pure gold:

<blockquote>
<p>Never trust a language that has no future tense and twenty words for "drunk."</p>
</blockquote>
