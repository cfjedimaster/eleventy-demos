I just watched a very interesting video on youtube (and no, it didn't involve unicorns):

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZYA2zFsCK8">Part 1</a><br>
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICRvZogSbdI&NR">Part 2</a>

The video talks about the Florida reporters who were fired for refusing to lie for Fox News. The courts upheld that Fox was <b>not</b> required to tell the truth.

I'm torn by this. I tend to think (outside of libel/slander), that a person can say what they want. Maybe this ruling can be a wake up call to the public to start questioning what they see from the media. 

For all it's cheesiness, Running Man did have some <i>very</i> interesting scenes. When the broadcasters were "photoshopping" events to twist them to match what they wanted to show, it now seems more prophetic than I could have imagined. For fun - try googling for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&rls=GGGL,GGGL:2006-16,GGGL:en&sa=X&oi=spell&resnum=0&ct=result&cd=1&q=reuters+photoshop&spell=1">reuters photoshop</a>.
