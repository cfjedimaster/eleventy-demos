I've recently had a few people email me at my gmail account, and I just wanted to let folks know that that is a <b>bad</b> way to contact me. I only use gmail for listservs and typically don't even load up the main inbox. If you need to reach me, please use the <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/contact.cfm">contact</a> form or email me at ray, the at symbol, camdenfamily, then use a period, and then a big fat com.

Thanks!
