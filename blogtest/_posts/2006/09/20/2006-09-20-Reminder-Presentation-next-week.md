Next week will be the next meeting of the "ColdFusion Jedi User Group." My presentation will be on adding a security system to a web application. This is definitely for beginners who know how to work with content and want to add CMS-type tools to their site, but don't know how to do it in a secure way. I'll cover how to add an "admin" tool to your site and ensure it is secured. 

I will not be covering security in terms of protecting url parameters and stuff like that. That is a complete other presentation.
