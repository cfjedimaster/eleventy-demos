If you are in the UK (or can afford to travel to it), check out <a href="http://www.cfdevcon.com/">CFDEVCON</a>. It is a one day conference on November 9 in Surrey, about 30 minutes or so from London. The price is 40 pounds (plus VAT), and if the exchange rate is anything like it was last time I was in England, that is only about 50-60 American dollars, which is pretty darn cheap if you ask me. Registration is open and some <a href="http://www.cfdevcon.com/#speakers">speakers and topics</a> are already announced.

You know - a long time ago (in Internet years), there used to be quite a few ColdFusion conferences. It seems like we are slowly returning to the those "good ole days" and I'm pretty darn happy to see it. (Now we just need to get CFSOUTH back - anyone want to help me? :)
