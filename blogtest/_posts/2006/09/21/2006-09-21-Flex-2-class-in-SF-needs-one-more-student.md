Forgive the advertisement (but hey, if the Google Ads don't bug you...): My organization is hosting a Flex 2 class in San Francisco on October 2 - 4th. The price is $1,495. We need one more sign up to host the class, so if you are interested, you can sign up here: <a href="http://www.roundpeg.com/home.cfm?main=training&action=classinfo&classid=
