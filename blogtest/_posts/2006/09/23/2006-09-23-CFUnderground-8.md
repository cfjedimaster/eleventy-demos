Going to <a href="http://www.adobe.com/events/max/">MAX</a>? If you will be in Las Vegas on Sunday, TeraTech will be holding <a href="http://www.cf-underground.com/">CFUnderground</a>. This is a one day mini-conference held on Sunday, October 22nd. I will be missing it this year (I don't get in till Monday at noon), but I can recommend the conference. As you can see by the title of this post, it will be the 8th time this event has taken place.
