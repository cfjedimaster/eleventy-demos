On Wednesday night of this week I'll be doing my presentation on adding a simple security system to your web sites. Wednesday morning I'll post the URL. I'm sick (again), but with just a cold, so be sure to show up and ask me complex questions and watch how slowly I respond. :)

Next week I'm on vacation so the blogging will be <b>very</b> light. On Sunday we are driving to Atlanta. Wednesday night I'll be presenting to that user group (I'm rapping about all my applications, which is a nice and flexible format which I like :) and then Thursday we drive back. 

By the end of this week I hope to have BlogCFC 5.5 released. If you haven't been following along with the development, check out the <a href="http://www.blogcfc.com">web site</a> for information about what I added.
