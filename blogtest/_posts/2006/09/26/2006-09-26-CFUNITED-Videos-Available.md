If you weren't able to attend CFUNITED (or if you weren't able to see all the sessions you wanted to), you can now purchase a video package. More information, including a sample video, may be found <a href="http://www.cfunited.com/video_recordings.cfm">here</a>. The price for people who did not attend the conference is $649. For those who did attend the price is $200.

I watched a bit of a few videos and I'm pretty surprised by the quality. You get both a video of the presenter as well as what was displayed on screen in a nice big display. They seem pretty well done.
