Tonight is the second meeting of my "ColdFusion Jedi User Group", which I know is a silly name and all, but I had to come up with something. The meeting will be at 6PM Central. The topic will be "Adding a Basic Security System to a Web Application", which is a lot more complex than it really is. I'm simply talking about how to add basic security (username/password) and roles to an application. <b>This class is for beginners!</b> 

The URL is:

I anticipate this meeting being a short one, and I'll try to have some tea with me so I don't sound too much like an aging jazz singer.
