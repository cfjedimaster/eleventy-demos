Steve House has written an excellent article on connecting Flex 2's Tree component with a CFC back end:

<a href="http://cyberdust.wordpress.com/2006/09/29/using-a-hierarchy-of-components-to-populate-a-flex-tree-control/">
Using a Hierarchy of Components to Populate a Flex Tree Control</a>

What I find most interesting is how he handles returning a null value to Flex to handle cases where there are no children. This is definitely an article to bookmark. I'd love to see someone (Adobe? Me? Whomever) create a nice list of articles that are purely Flex+ColdFusion.
Hey Steve - you mentioned you had trouble posting the article with WordPress. Maybe it's time for another <a href="http://www.blogcfc.com">blog</a>? :)
