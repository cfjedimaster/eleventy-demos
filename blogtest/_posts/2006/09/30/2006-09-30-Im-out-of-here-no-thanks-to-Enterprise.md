This is my last post before heading out for vacation. I'll be checking email at night, but not really posting. Oh, let me give a big thanks to Enterprise Rent-A-Car. My wife and I made a "reservation" two weeks ago. When I called today, I was told the car we wanted wasn't there, and that it would possible show up any day now.

Serious.

They then told me they were working to find me another car (we needed a car to fit 7) and then promptly left at 1PM without even calling. 

Thanks a lot Enterprise. Wasn't there a Seinfeld episode once where he asked how they could call it a "reservation" when nothing was actually reserved?

Luckily we picked up a good vehicle from Budget and well - it is time for me to not worry anymore. Good bye!
