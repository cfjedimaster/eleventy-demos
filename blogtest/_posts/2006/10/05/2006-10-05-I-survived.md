I've been up since 3AM but I am now back from Atlanta. I'm about 100+ emails behind so please do not expect quick responses if you sent in a support request. I'm not really going to be "back" until Sunday so as I've said - things will be quiet here.

The <a href="http://www.georgiaaquarium.org/">Atlanta Aquarium</a> is amazing. I simply cannot describe it. I walked in and my jaw dropped. If you are anywhere even near Atlanta, I cannot recommend it enough. 

I'd also recommend the <a href="http://www.fernbank.edu/museum/">Fernbank Natural History Museum</a>. It was one of the most beautiful museums I've seen. (And the Imperial Rome exhibit was great.)
