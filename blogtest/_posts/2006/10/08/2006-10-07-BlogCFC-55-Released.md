The 5.5 release of BlogCFC is now released. You may download it from the <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/projects/blogcfc">project page</a>. Lots of new stuff in this release - and here is just a partial list of what has been added:

<ul>
<li>BlogCFC now supports slideshows. Slideshows can have titles and captions. Slideshows can be created via a web based admin.</li>
<li>Files can be uploaded/changed via a web based admin.</li>
<li>XML-RPC support.</li>
<li>Ability to quickly upload an image when editing a new entry.</li>
<li>Default CAPTCHA made simpler. Thanks to Charlie Arehart.</li>
<li>Oracle support (thanks to Deanna Schneider)</li>
<li>Support for DSNs that require usernames/password (ditto thanks to Deanna)</li>
<li>Various UI changes</li>
</ul>

This is a just a small set of changes since the last official release, 5.1.004. I'd suggest checking the readme.txt file for a complete listing of updates.

As always - BlogCFC is what it is because of the support of my users. This release had a lot of help. Deanna Schneider - Scott Stroz - and many others contributed both code and bug reports to help me get this release finished.
