A user contacted me today and mentioned that he is looking to start a hosting service specially designed for ColdFusion users. He wanted to know what the top things CF developers would want out of a host - and also what bugs them out their current hosts. 

As an aside, my host is CFXHosting.com. They have graciously allowed me to host my ColdFusion sites for free for some time, so I always try to take the opportunity to mention them to my readers.
