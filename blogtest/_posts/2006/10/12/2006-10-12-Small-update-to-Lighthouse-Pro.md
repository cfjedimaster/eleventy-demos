A very minor update was released today for <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/projects/lhp">Lighthouse Pro</a>. The new version is 2.1.002 and contains the following updates:

<ul>
<li>/components/IssueManager.cfc - Big change to emails. Michael White wrote an HTML version of the bug emails.
<li>Stats are now called Reports. Remember if we call it something else, people won't know better. (For example,  "Alternative Questioning Procedures" isn't really torture.) I also show the Creator field in the Excel dump.
<li>The RSS page now has auto-discovery links for Firefox.
</ul>
