I was planning a simple tutorial on how to create an RSS feed. This would be a very simple and direct "Do This", and not "Here are the ten thousand versions of RSS" type of article, but Pete beat me to it. You can find this article here:

<a href="http://www.petefreitag.com/item/465.cfm">Howto Create an RSS 2.0 Feed</a>

If you just need to get a RSS feed up quickly, this is the article for you. 

By the way - time for a &lt;cftease&gt; - In a few days (or week or so, but close) something is going to launch. What is it? I can't say. But I can say it is the main reason my open source applications have slowed down quite a bit the last few months.
