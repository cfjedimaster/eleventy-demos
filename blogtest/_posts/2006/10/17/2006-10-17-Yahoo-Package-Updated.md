This is a small update. I've now included the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/maps/rest/V1/geocode.html">Geocoding API</a> in my package. This lets you get a longitude/latitude value from an address. You can download it from the <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/projects/yahoopackage/">project page</a>.
