I was in a meeting today and ran into a few people who weren't aware of the <a href="http://www.coldfusioncookbook.com/">ColdFusion Cookbook</a>. The Cookbook is a site with simple Q/A style pages. For example, <a href="http://www.coldfusioncookbook.com/entry/114/How-do-I-return-a-query-from-an-Excel-file?">How do I return a query from an Excel file?</a> The site currently has over 100 entries and also offers a printed version.

To give credit where credit is due - while I built the site, <a href="http://www.petersenfam.com/jeremy">Jeremy Petersen</a> does (almost all of) the content editing. 

Anyway - if everyone knew about this - forgive the noise!
