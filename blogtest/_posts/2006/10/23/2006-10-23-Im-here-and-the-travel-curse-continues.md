I arrived safely, and I should be happy (I am of course ;) but there was a hiccup. For some reason the hotel thought I was arriving yesterday and simply cancelled my account. A <b>very</b> nice Adobe rep (whose name I cannot remember) fixed me up in about five minutes.

Anyway - hope to see everyone soon!
