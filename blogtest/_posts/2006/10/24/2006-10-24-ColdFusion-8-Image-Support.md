I'm not covering everything here as I was a bit late, but here are the high level features:

Resizing (in various ways)<br>
Pasting images over each other<br>
Adding text to an image<br>
CAPTHA (of various levels of difficulty)<br>
base64 encoding images<br>
Works with Blogs (lets you store images in databases)<br>
Read Exif/IPTC metadata<br>
Basic drawing functions (line, rectangle, curves)<br>
