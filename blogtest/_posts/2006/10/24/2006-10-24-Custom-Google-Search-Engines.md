Filed under the "How do they make money" category, Google has released <a href="http://www.google.com/coop/cse/overview">Google Co-op custom search engines</a>. This allows you to create a search engine with various filters automatically in place. Consider this simple <a href="http://www.google.com/coop/cse?cx=002988318612745418124%3Ae5ryuhjfoyq">ColdFusion</a> one. I set it up to search House of Fusion, my blog, and MXNA, but to not limit itself to just those sites. Google also lets you turn on AdSense (ahem, which I did of course), customize the colors, add it to your home page, etc. Pretty interesting.
