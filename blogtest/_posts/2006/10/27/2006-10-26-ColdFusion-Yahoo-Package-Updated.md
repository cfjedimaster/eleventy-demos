I've updated my ColdFusion Yahoo package. You can download it from <a href="http://cfyahoo.riaforge.org">RIAForge</a>. New in this release is support for term extraction (find relevant keywords from a block of text) and audio searching. You can search for artists, songs, albums, and even places to buy music. 

The Yahoo Package now contains easy APIs for...

<ul>
<li>Answers
<li>Audio
<li>Geocoding
<li>Maps
<li>Search
<li>Term Extraction
<li>Traffic
<li>Weather
</ul>
