On Wednesday, which is technically November, I'll be holding the October CFJUG (Jedi User Group) meeting. This will be on Breeze at 6PM Central. This will be a follow up to my previous presentation on security, and will cover more details in regards to securing your applications. As a guide, I'm going to follow (most of) the bullet points mentioned on my <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/coldfusionsecuritychecklist.cfm">CF security checklist</a>.

If you guys can - please RSVP so I have an idea of who will be showing up.
