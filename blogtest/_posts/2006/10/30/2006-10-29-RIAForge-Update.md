Just a quick note to publicly thank everyone who has posted their project to <a href="http://www.riaforge.org">RIAForge</a>. How are we doing? Check out these stats:

Total Active Projects: 67<br />
Total Views: 36489<br />
Total Downloads: 2507<br />
Total Verified Users: 442<br />

Pretty impressive I think. I've been slowly rolling out updates to help improve the site, both in features and bug fixes. Look for search to get added this week. (I know, it should have been there at launch!) Also, check out this excellent <a href="http://www.pbell.com/index.cfm/2006/10/22/Instructions-for-Getting-Started-with-Subversion-on-RIAForge-using-Subclipse">blog post</a> by Peter Bell. It helps you set up your project to use Subversion with RIAForge. It is excellent for those who are new to Subversion and need a little help. (Peter, I may "innovate" that help into the site. Thanks!)
