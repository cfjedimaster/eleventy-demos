Dear LG, provider of TVs, appliances, and other fine devices:

I just wanted to send you a quick thank you note. Thanks for selling me a dish washer that I had to return because it was rusty. Thanks for replacing it with one that has broken down 2-3 times over the past few months. Lastly, thanks for telling me you would replace the unit (a month ago), and then telling me that since I got the unit at a discount, that I'd have to pay the difference to get a new unit. Thanks for saying it is Best Buy's fault and I should take it up with them. (Can't wait for that call.) Thanks for telling me that since Best Buy didn't charge me for the second install (remember the first one was rusty?) that I'd have to pay for a third install. Thanks for everything, really.
