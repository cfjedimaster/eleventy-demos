Once again Adobe is using the <a href="http://labs.adobe.com">Labs</a> site to release new software in development - this time a ColdFusion toolkit that integrates with WebSphere Portal Server. From the site:

<blockquote>
The ColdFusion Portlet Toolkit is a proof-of-concept library that allows you to use ColdFusion as a Portal Application within an IBM WebSphere Portal Server (WSPS version 5 and greater). A Portal Application can serve several different portlets. Every portlet you deploy will run inside the same ColdFusion Portal Application. This toolkit provides one concrete Portlet called CFCPortlet. This Portlet simply passes the requests on to the ColdFusion server. The ColdFusion then invokes CFC methods to render the Portlet, and to perform actions. You can deploy several instances of this Portlet on your Portal Server. The setting cfcName defines which CFC will be used to marshal the Portlet events.
</blockquote>

Seems pretty cool. You can find more information here: <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/ColdFusion_Portlet_Toolkit">http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/ColdFusion_Portlet_Toolkit</a>
