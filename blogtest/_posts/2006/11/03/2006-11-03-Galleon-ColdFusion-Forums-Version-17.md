It's been a long time since I had a real release of Galleon, my ColdFusion Forums package. Today I am happy to release a major new release, version 1.7. This version incorporates some of the changes that Rick Root had added to <a href="http://www.cfmbb.org/forums.cfm">CFMBB</a>, which was based on an earlier version of Galleon. To be honest - I left Galleon get stale for a while - so hopefully this update will get people excited about the product again. Changes in this release are:

<ul>
<li>Passwords can be encrypted.
<li>Signatures.
<li>Gravatars.
<li>Code block support so you can embed code in the post.
<li>Message attachments.
</ul>

You can download Galleon from RIAForge: <a href="http://galleon.riaforge.org">http://galleon.riaforge.org</a>

My own forums (<a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/forums">ray.camdenfamily.com/forums</a>) will be updated later this weekend.
