Tonight our user group talked about regular expressions, or regex. While I think I'm pretty good with them - I didn't have a good tool to write them. I typically just fired up a ColdFusion file and did my tests via the browser. 

The speaker at tonight's meeting showed off <a href="http://weitz.de/regex-coach/">The Regex Coach</a>, a real handy, but Windows only, little tool to let you test regular expressions. Now I just need to find a Mac equivalent.
