I'll be speaking at the <a href="http://www.frameworksconference.com/">Frameworks Conference</a> being held in Rockville. The conference is from February 1st to 2nd and <a href="https://secure.teratech.com/frameworks2007/pages/secure_registration.cfm">registration</a> is now open. I'm not quite sure what I'm talking on yet - but I'm sure it will smell like glue.
