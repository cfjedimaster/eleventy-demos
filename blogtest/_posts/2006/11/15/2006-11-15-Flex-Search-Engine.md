Ted Patrick, Flex Evangelist, released the first alpha of his <a href="http://www.onflex.org/ted/2006/11/flex-search-alpha-1.php">Flex Search Engine</a>. What does it search? Flex content of course. Specifically:

<blockquote>
The current engine contains the collective history of Flexcoders, FlexComponents, Flex Developer Center articles, Flex documentation, AS3 documentation, and soon blogs from the flex community.
</blockquote>

The Flex app was written in about thirty minutes, which seems just about right. The back end is all ColdFusion, using MySQL and it's full text search engine. 

Just another darn good example of Flex and ColdFusion!
