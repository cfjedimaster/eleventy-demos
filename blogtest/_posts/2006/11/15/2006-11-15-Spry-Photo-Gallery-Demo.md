Don Booth of the Spry team created a darn cool Spry demo. It is a simple photo gallery but it really comes off nicely.

I'm not a big fan of effects but they really work well here. Be sure to view source. There isn't a lot of code behind this application. This may get "innovated" into the BlogCFC Slideshow feature.
