This was already <a href="http://blog.acidlabs.org/2006/11/16/i-heart-vertigo/">reported</a> by acidlabs, but it deserves repeating. Vertigo, the "edgy" part side of DC, is <a href="http://www.dccomics.com/news/?nw=6186">releasing</a> PDFs of some of its most classic comics, including Sandman (a work of art), Hellblazer, and Preacher. Unfortunately they aren't in the handy CBR format, but are still quite readable in PDF form.

I read comics off and on growing up - but Sandman really hooked me. I didn't even know comics like that existed at the time and for a while I read quite a bit of the Vertigo line. I stopped buying comics a few years after college, but am now getting back into it, specifically Marvel's Ultimates line.
