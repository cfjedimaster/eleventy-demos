Boyzoid has a very nice, simple, and direct example of doing a custom component in Flex:

<a href="http://www.boyzoid.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/11/22/Flex-Custom-Components-and-Custom-Methods">Flex Custom Components and Methods</a>

This is a follow up to my <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2006/11/22/Second-revision-of-my-Flex-homework">last entry</a> where I mentioned the potential need to add a function to the ViewStack component. (Be sure to read the comments on that entry. I had read the docs wrong and it wasn't necessary.)

By the way - Boyzoid is my Flex hero. He just recently learned Flex this year but is already teaching me a lot. You only need to look at <a href="http://flogr.riaforge.org/">Flogr</a> to get a good idea of what a "newbie" can do with the power of Flex. (Ok, sorry to sound like an Adobe cheerleader, but I just can't get over how happy I am with Flex 2.)
