The title says it all. Speaking personally, I'm incredibly thankful for my family. Outside of the family - thank you to everyone who reads this blog and adds their comments, both positive and negative, to help keep me on track. I think I've learned a heck of a lot more from the folks who post here than I've taught my readers, so thanks to all of you as well. I'll drink a good beer today for each and everyone of you. (Ok, maybe not for <i>all</i> of you....)
