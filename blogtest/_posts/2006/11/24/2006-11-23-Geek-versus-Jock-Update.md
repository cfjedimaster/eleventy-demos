Kevin sent me this link a few days ago:

In case you don't remember, Manning and his buddies teased, and then beat up some poor guy who dared to use a laptop. He has been suspended for one game, which seems pretty lax to me. I mean, beating someone up isn't the end of the world, but it reflects an attitude that I think is pretty disgusting. I really hope the victim takes Manning to court.
