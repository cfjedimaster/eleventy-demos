Ok, so I've complained about this so many times before I'm not even going to bother linking to the older entries, but it looks like Microsoft has finally addressed the issue of running multiple versions of IE in the same browser.

With a OS image.

I'm not kidding - look <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2006/11/30/ie6-and-ie7-running-on-a-single-machine.aspx">here</a>.

I don't pretend to be a Windows programmer - or even a high level programmer. (I'm a CF Jedi/Flex Padawan and that is fine with me.) But I'm sorry - I <b>refuse</b> to believe that there is no way to run IE6 and IE7 on the same box. Am I the only who thinks this is either an excuse to drive up browser/license usage or a sign of <b>really bad programming</b> on Microsoft's part? 

I mean seriously. You take a string of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and render it in an engine. Are you telling me there is <b>no</b> way that can't be packaged up and run by itself? You built an operating system where that was impossible? Man I am glad I'm on a Mac now (at least on my laptop).

Anyway - I promise this is my last rant on this. (This year anyway. ;)
