I have a rather big announcement to make. For the upcoming new year I've decided to make a rather drastic life change. I'm more than a little bit scared - but this is something I've wanted to do for a <i>long</i> time now. I feel like if I don't do it now - I won't do it ever.

December 22nd will be my last day with <a href="http://www.roundpeg.com">roundpeg</a>. I've enjoyed my time there - but have come to realization that my passion lies a bit closer to the code. I am leaving roundpeg to become a full time consultant. I will have more information available soon, but I will be available to hire for:

<ul>
<li>ColdFusion Development (including Model-Glue of course)
<li>Flex Development
<li>Spry Development
<li>Training in all of the above. 
</ul>

I still plan to be the avid blogger I've always been, so you need not worry there, and hopefully I'll be able to share a lot more since I'll be back in the grind. I can also promise you that my open source development will not slack off. I still plan on getting Canvas and Soundings 2.0 out this year.

I do ask that if you are interested in working me that you use my contact form (or email address) and not the comments below. 

Ok, let's get started!
