I'm looking into various accounting packages that I can use for my new business and one of things I'd like to consider is an online version. I want this because I'm going back and forth between a PC and a Mac, plus I just want something I can access from multiple locations.

One of the first ones I looked at was <a href="http://oe.quickbooks.com/">Quickbooks Online Edition</a>. I was all ready to try the free demo when I discovered that...

a) Their online edition only supports Windows operating systems.

b) Their online edition only supports IE.

I realize that still represents a sizable portion of the net, but I couldn't imagine, as a web developer, selling this to a client.
