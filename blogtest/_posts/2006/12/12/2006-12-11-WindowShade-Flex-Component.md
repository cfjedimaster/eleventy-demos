A friend asked me a few days ago if there was a "WindowShade" type Flex component. By that she meant a panel or some sort where you can double click to hide the contents of the panel. Stephen Gilson had such a component. As he doesn't have a blog (dude, get <a href="http://www.blogcfc.com">one</a>! ;) I'm posting his code here. It isn't quite what my friend wanted, but is pretty cool.

I will <i>readily</i> admit I don't quite get how the drawing works - but it is pretty cool how he embedded the icons for the panel into the code itself. 

You can see this in action here:

And you can right click to see Stephan's source and download the component. 

Who else thinks it is time for a CFLib for Flex 2 components?
