Ok, so I googled this a bit and wasn't able to find anything. I don't use my DVD-RW drive very often. I normally use it to rip CDs, install software, or burn a disc. These all work fine. Yesterday I put in a video DVD (Ie, a normal DVD you would watch on TV), and it showed up as a blank disc in XP. I tried ejecting/reinserting a few times, but it always just showed up as blank. Anyone else seen this?
