This time I'm serious, <a href="http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/entitlement/index.cfm?e=labs%5Fspry">Spry 1.4</a> is out now. I have a few blog posts planned, but it will have to wait till I'm off the wonderful drugs I'm on now. Let me send a big Bah Humbug to those of you who dared to send bug reports. Not fair to request help from the drugged Jedi. ;)
