I just found out that my blog won "2006 ColdFusion Blog of the Year" over at the <a href="http://cfsilence.com/blog/client/index.cfm/2006/12/22/2006-CFeMmys--And-The-Winners-Are">CFeMmys</a> being run by Todd. I want to thank everyone who voted me. I am convinced, however, that the true strength of this blog is from the readers who post their comments. So congrats to everyone. What a nice way to end the year!
