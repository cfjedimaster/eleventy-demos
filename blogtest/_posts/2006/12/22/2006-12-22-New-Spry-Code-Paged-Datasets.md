The Spry guys have left us a little Christmas preset - new demos and a new feature, the <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/spry/samples/data_region/SpryPagedViewSample.html">PagedView</a> class. From the description:

<blockquote>
This sample shows you how to use the Spry.Data.PagedView class to control the paging of data in a data set. The PagedView class is a special type of data set that listens to another data set and knows how to extract data out of the other data set whenever it changes. Because it is a data set, you use it within spry:regions to present a paged view of the data. There are special methods on the PagedView class that allow you to jump to random pages, or display a page that contains a specific row of data. Because the PagedView extracts its data from the data set it depends on, the ds_RowID value for each row in the PagedView is identical to the ds_RowID of the corresponding row in the data set it depends on.
</blockquote>

Cool stuff. Along with this are new demos and examples of stuff from the 1.4 release. More information may be found <a href="http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/webforums/forum/messageview.cfm?forumid=72&catid=602&threadid=1226651&enterthread=y">here</a>.
