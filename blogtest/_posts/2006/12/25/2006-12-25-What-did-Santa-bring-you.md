My big gift actually came a few days ago. I finally took the HD plunge with a Sony 46 inch 1080p LCD. I watched football on it for the first time yesterday (Go Saints!) and was just in awe at how great it looked. My kids got a great collection of gifts. My son got the Avatar DVD set which I can't wait to watch with him. My wife got me the Han Solo/Chewbacca 
Transformer to add to my Star Wars collection. 

So - anyone else get some cool loot?

And yes, I know the day isn't about presents, but lets pretend we're shallow for a minute. :)
