Recently I updated my Windows Media Player to version 11. Why? No real reason. I rarely use WMP but I was bored so I figured it couldn't hurt. 

Tonight I was going to show some pictures on my XBox 360 to some family and for some reason, the pictures that I had previously shared (using Windows Media Connect) no longer showed up on the XBox. 

Turns out that WMP now is the primary handler for all shared media streaming from the box. I had to re-add my photos to the application in order for them to show up again. Even that was a pain in the rear. The new UI of WMP11 is just plain weird. Sorry - maybe I'm old school but I like my applications nice and square with <b>standard</b> file menus. I can handle going back and forth between the PC and the Mac, but I hate it when applications get "artsy".
