Since I plan on being a bit - how shall we say - "Not Prepared to Type" at midnight, consider this an early Happy New Year's message to my readers. 2007 should be wonderful. I have a new job (and a new boss, myself!). We will have ColdFusion 8 (which by all accounts looks to be the best release ever). We will have Apollo (Central done right). We have Flex 2 (and I'd be willing to bet we see some interesting signs of Flex 3). It is a great time to be a web developer!
