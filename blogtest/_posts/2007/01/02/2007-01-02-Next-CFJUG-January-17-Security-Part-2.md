So, it has been long delayed, but I'm now officially rescheduling the next CFJUG (ColdFusion Jedi User Group) meeting. This meeting will be on Wednesday, January 17th, at 6PM Central. 

This will be a follow up to my previous presentation on security, and will cover more details in regards to securing your applications. As a guide, I'm going to follow (most of) the bullet points mentioned on my <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/coldfusionsecuritychecklist.cfm">CF security checklist</a>.
	
Please RSVP (by leaving a comment) so I have an idea of how many people will show up. If a company would like to sponsor this meeting with a give away, let me know. (And I'm not doing this to sell out - but to have something to offer to folks as a reward for showing up to listen to my sexy voice. ;)
