Do you have a good AJAX/ColdFusion tutorial/blog entry/story, etc? If so, please submit to <a href="http://www.ajax-tutorials.com/tutorial-list/">AJAX-tutorials.com</a>. I asked them to add an AJAX and ColdFusion category and they have done so. I'm not trying to pass the buck here. I plan on writing as well, but as I'll be out of the office next week it may be a little while. So if you have some content, help spread the word. (And show those .Net/PHP folks how nice CF is! :)
