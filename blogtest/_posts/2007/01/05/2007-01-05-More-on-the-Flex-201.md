Just a quick note here to point to the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/support/documentation/en/flex/2/releasenotes_flex201_sdk.html">release notes</a> for Flex 2.0.1. What interests me most is the Module support - something I need to look into soon.

For those curious - I do have a new Flex demo in the works. Since this is in my spare time it may take me a little while. I wanted to build a simple site where a user could register, login, and manage contacts and notes. (I even have a cool name, but that's as far as I got.) My main reason for building this is that as much as I like OneNote, I can't carry it with me.
