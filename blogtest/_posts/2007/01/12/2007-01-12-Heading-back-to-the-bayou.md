After a week of training in Virginia, I'll be heading home tomorrow morning. Sorry for the extremely light blogging this week (although, come on, I bet at least some of you were happy to get a few less emails ;) and if you sent me an email, give me a few days to get back to you. 

Oh - and I finally played Guitar Hero 2 tonight. That is the most absolutely fun game I've ever played in my life. Although my little sister kicked my butt.
