Ok - so I know I blogged like 10 minutes ago (I'm making up for last week), but a few moments ago <a href="http://www.figleaf.com">Figleaf</a> announced that they are running a new Flex 2 conference as well: <a href="http://flex2conference.figleaf.com/">FlexManiacs</a>. (I <b>love</b> that name!) 

It will be held in Washington, DC from June 25 to June 26. The price is $249. While not as cheap as <a href="http://360flex.org">360Flex</a>, that is still a darn good price for a two day conference.

I'm hoping that in a few months I'll be speaking at conferences like these!
