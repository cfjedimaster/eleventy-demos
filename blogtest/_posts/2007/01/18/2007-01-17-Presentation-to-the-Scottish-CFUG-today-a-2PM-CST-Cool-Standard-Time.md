I'll be doing a quick presentation today for the Scottish ColdFusion User Group. My presentation will be a quick introduction to Model-Glue. I'll be focusing on 1.1 but will be showing a bit of the 2.0 beta as well.

The URL for the presentation is: <a href="http://adobechats.adobe.acrobat.com/r66866989/">http://adobechats.adobe.acrobat.com/r66866989/ </a>. Everyone is invited. I will mention though that this is just a quick introduction. If you know Model-Glue already you really won't learn much.

Oh, and yes, I'll be in full Braveheart makeup. Seriously.

p.s. If your company is interested in Model-Glue training, let me know.
