Adobe is running a survey to find developers who can help decide what Flex 3 will look like. The full text of their invite is below:

<blockquote>
Hello,

Adobe is looking for experienced PHP, Java, ColdFusion, and Ajax developers to participate in an advisory panel on the future of Adobe Flex. If you would like to help shape the future of rich internet applications, fill out the following survey (no prior Flex experience required):

https://prerelease.adobe.com/callout/default.html?callid=90D54BEDFD134F6D886F50C5DF830AB2

Selected respondents for the private panel will have the opportunity to provide feedback on future versions of Adobe Flex and test early releases of Adobe software. In appreciation, all active participants will be eligible to receive a complimentary license of an Adobe desktop product.
</blockquote>

Notice that you do <b>not</b> need to be a Flex developer currently.
