Ok, I'm mad. Really mad. And I typically don't post when I'm ticked off, but there is something that is so unacceptable to me that I cannot stay quiet. I'm not going to name names, but I just have to bring this up.

I work on a web site with some friends of mine. Recently the site has been having stability issues. The site will stop responding, we get JRun errors, etc.

This is on a shared server, so there could be any number of reasons why this is happening. Shoot, it can even be my code.

So my friend calls tech support when the site was down again today, for the third time this week. What did support say? It was our fault.

Ok, I'm fine with that. But when we asked for log files to prove it, we were told:

<blockquote>
The ColdFusion server you are on is up and running. The error is limited to your website. Restarting the ColdFusion service to get your site back up is affecting other domains on this server. Please make changes in your code to stop this issue. If you upgrade to a dedicated server you could have access to server log files to diagnoses such issues. This option is not available on our shared servers.
</blockquote>

So let me see if I get this. They are saying our code isn't working, but if we want to prove it, we need to give them more money?

That's crap. Period. They could easily zip up the logs, or, if they are worried about us seeing issues from other clients, they could hop in the Log Viewer and do a quick search on our application name.

I'm going to stop now before I name names and say something I regret, but I simply cannot believe a company would respond like this.
