Following the meme that <a href="http://www.buntel.com/blog/index.cfm?mode=entry&entry=54DB3FFD-4E22-1671-5BDCF74737695F12">Tim</a> started, I thought I'd answer the Developer Persona as well:

<ul>
<li>33 years old
<li>Married for over ten years and has three kids. (Along with cats and a flatulent dog.)
<li>Drives a Toyota Highlander Hybrid (which got a flat this morning)
<li>Bought a home a few years ago. No idea what style it is. It has walls, floors, and ceilings. Oh, and windows too.
<li>Is slowly becoming a Mac convert. Uses a Mac laptop and will have a Mac desktop this summer.
<li>Thinks Children of Men should win everything. Twice.
<li>Just a tiny bit into Lost (ahem), Battlestar Galatica, the Office, Heroes, and other good "geek" tv (launching GeekTheTube.com soon). Watches a soap opera that he won't admit the name of...
<li>Likes to play snowboarding on the XBox. Real life? Um - no.
<li>Food. Yes.
<li>Musically tends to prefer progressive, dance, and classical. Big into "classic alternative" and the "Shoegazer" subgenre. Really like female-led bands (Lush and Curve are in the mix right now). Recently got into Public Enemy. 
<li>Doesn't get why Youtube is as popular as it is. (And secretly wishes he had invented it.)
</ul>
