In a few hours I'll be heading out to the airport (with free WiFi!) to fly up to D.C. for the <a href="http://www.frameworksconference.com/">Frameworks Conference</a>. I'm presenting an introduction to Model-Glue.  It looks like there will be some <b>darn</b> nice presentations at this conference. I don't typically attend a lot of sessions at conferences (not that I know everything of course), but I think I'll be pretty booked at this one.

So - please pardon the slowdown in posting (although I'm going to try to review every session I attend), and as always, don't forget the rule: While I'm gone there are no bugs in my applications. Just features.
