I'm so proud I could cry. I've <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2006/5/17/I-love-Louisiana-but">blogged</a> on Louisiana and cock fighting before, but it looks like we will soon be the <b>only</b> state in the country where it will be legal. New Mexico, the only other state, is now <a href="http://www.katc.com/Global/story.asp?S=6037554&Call=Email&Format=HTML">close</a> to banning the practice.

I still say that if the legislature here thinks it is legal, they should put it on TV and broadcast it. If there is nothing to be ashamed of then why not stand behind it?
