Ok, so I'll admit. I loved Flash Forms. I built applications with them and I really dug them. But now that Flex 2 is free, I'm completely dropping them. 

So why bring this up? I still get quite a few questions about Flash Forms, and honestly, I'm pretty darned rusty with them now. 

My personal recommendation is for folks to rip out any use of Flash Forms and consider it an excellent way to learn Flex!
