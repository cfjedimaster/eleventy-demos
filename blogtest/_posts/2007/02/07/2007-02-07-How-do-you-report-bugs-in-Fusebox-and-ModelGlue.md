So one of the first things I asked Sean about was how to report bugs in Fusebox. Turns out there is a public bug tracker so you can not only report bugs but check for existing bugs as well. You may find the Fusebox bug tracker here:

Model-Glue uses the same system (Trac) and it's bug tracker may be found here:
