I had to update the <a href="http://www.riaforge.org">RIAForge</a> server so it was down for a while. All should be ok now. If you didn't realize it was down, then please ignore this blog entry. (By the way, <a href="http://www.talkingtree.com/blog/">Steven Erat</a> kicks major you know what for saving my you know what during the update.)
