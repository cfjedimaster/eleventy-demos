Matt Woodward recently released a nice guide for those of us who have left the "joy" of Windows and moved over to the Mac:

<a href="http://mattwoodward.com/articles/setup_mac_dev_environment.pdf">Setting Up a New OS X Development Environment for ColdFusion</a>

This is a nice little PDF with a great overview of the tools that folks moving to the Mac will need for development.
