The title says it all. Version 2 of <a href="http://www.fusion-reactor.com/fusiondebug/">FusionDebug</a> has been released. New features include source code lookups, a custom perspective, and a "complete package" install if you want to make it even simpler. (This complete package includes CFE as well!) For more on what's new in 2.0, see <a href="http://www.fusion-reactor.com/fusiondebug/featureFocus-2.0.html">this page</a>.
