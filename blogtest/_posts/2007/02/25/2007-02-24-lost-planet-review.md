I just finished playing Lost Planet for the XBox 360 and I thought I'd pass along my thoughts. Lost Planet is an arcade style shooter set on a desolate freezing cold planet. Much of the fighting takes place against the Akrid, a bug like race that reminded me a <i>lot</i> of Starship Troopers. You also fight against other humans, and there is quite a bit of mech fighting as well. 

All in all I thought it was a great game. As I mentioned, the game reminded me a lot of Starship Troopers, which wasn't the best movie, but was fun. I thought the aliens were well done in the movie and they were just as well done in this game. You never knew what new type of bug was going to jump out at you. Some of the larger creatures are incredible. I remember more than once thinking there was no way in heck I was going to survice. 

The game also has multiple styles of mechs (big robots) for you to pilot. It's not Battletech, but at least you have some chance on foot against the robots. What's even cooler is that you can swap out the weapons on your mech (the game calls em VS, but I always called them mechs) for better chances against a particular enemy.

The graphics are absolutely stunning in HD. The sound is average though. Not great or bad. There were quite a few cut scenes in the game. Some were ok - but honestly I enjoyed the game so much I really didn't pay much attention to them. I was more eager to get back into the action.

I'd definitely recommend this game. I heard that the game had a lot of bad reviews but I had an incredible amount of fun playing it, and will probably play through the whole game again.

On the flip side - I got Call of Duty 3 a good two or three months ago and haven't played it more than a few times. Call of Duty 2 was amazing but the third installment is simply more of the same with a few "click the right button" games tacked on. Plus the game has a bug where your soldier will simply get stuck for no good reason. I'd definitely avoid COD3 unless you are <i>really</i> hard up for another WW 2 game.
