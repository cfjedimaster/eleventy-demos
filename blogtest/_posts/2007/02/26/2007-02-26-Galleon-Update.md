I got the new update to <a href="http://galleon.riaforge.org">Galleon</a> up on RIAForge. I'm happy that's up after all the hullabaloo from last week. (Do you have any idea how long I've waited to use hullabaloo in a blog post??) Thanks to Rob Gonda for his help. This new addition has (along with changes to the back end to support an object factory) the following updates:

<ul>
<li>You can now do quotes when replying to a post. It is a manual process, but it gets displayed nicely.
<li>I remove the special tags ([code] for example) from emails.
<li>A few fixes for BlueDragon compatibility.
<li>In the admin screens for users, threads, and messages, you can now enter a search term to filter the data. Very handy for trying to find a particular message or user.
</ul>

As always - comments, suggestions, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/registry/2TCL1D08EZEYE">wishlist</a> items are appreciated.
