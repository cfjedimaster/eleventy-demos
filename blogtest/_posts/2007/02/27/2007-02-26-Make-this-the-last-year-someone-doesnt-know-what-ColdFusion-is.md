After the recent trouble I had with <a href="http://www.thepeoplestoolbox.com/programmers/">The People's Toolbox</a>, I'm going to keep an eye out for any and every chance possible to help spread the gospel of ColdFusion. 

Rey Bango has released <a href="http://www.gotcfm.com/">GotCFM?com</a> - a site that aggregates and lists out ColdFusion powered web sites.

<b>But it needs you.</b> Please go and submit <b>all</b> of your ColdFusion powered web sites to help this list grow. Consider it a mission. Consider it a crusade. Just spread the word and add your sites.
