Welcome to my first "State of the Forge" report - a simple update on the latest stats at <a href="http://www.riaforge.org">RIAForge</a>. I plan on doing this at the end of every month to keep folks in the know about how the site is doing. 

First just the stats:

Total Active Projects: 167<br />
Total Views: 416650<br />
Total Downloads: 40375<br />
Total Verified Users: 1330<br />
Updates in past 24 hours: 8<br />
Unique Logins in past 24 hours: 33<br />
New users in past 24 hours: 10<br />
Pageviews: Over 5,000 per day in February.

For the site in general - I've been working on a large addition (I won't say what, but as a hint, have you noticed how I'm trying to get <a href="http://canvas.riaforge.org">Canvas</a> shipped?) as well as general improvements here and there.
