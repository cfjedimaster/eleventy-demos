I'm a bit late on this, but the location/dates for MAX 2007 have been <a href="http://forta.com/blog/index.cfm?mode=entry&entry=09E91627-3048-80A9-EFC29EC9DC72FEFB">announced </a> over on Ben's blog:

MAX North America: September 30-October 3, 2007, Chicago, IL<br>
MAX EMEA: October 2007, Barcelona, Spain<br>
MAX Japan: November 2007, Japan<br>

This will be my first time in Chicago (of course, I'm only going if I get asked to speak). I'd love to go to the MAX in Japan.
