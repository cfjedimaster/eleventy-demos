I'll be presenting to the <a href="http://www.cfug.co.nz/">Auckland ColdFusion User Group</a> today. Yes, <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=auckland&layer=&ie=UTF8&z=4&ll=-36.879621,174.726563&spn=56.988994,167.34375&om=1&iwloc=addr">Auckland</a>. The presentation is at 11PM CST so come hear me speak in half-sensible sentences mixes in with dreams of sleep. This is my Spry (with a side of ColdFusion) presentation that I think some of you have seen before, but if you <i>are</i> up at the ungodly hour, check me out.
