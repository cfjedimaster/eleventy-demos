So I've been ranting and raving about how we need to make this the year <i>everyone</i> knows about ColdFusion. Well, I am <i>very</i> happy to say that Yahoo has just updated their <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/search/">Search SDK</a>, and guess what language makes a <b>brand new appearance??</b>.

Yep - that's right. <b>COLDFUSION!</b> Sorry to "yell" but I'm just that happy about it. The SDK includes both a simple search example and my <a href="http://cfyahoo.riaforge.org/">ColdFusion Yahoo package</a>.

And there is more coming soon...
