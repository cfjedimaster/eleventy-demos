I meant to post this a few days ago but completely forgot. During my travels to NYC last week I noticed two odd language uses I just had to share.

First - the ATM at the airport asked me not to use or insert my card, but rather to <i>dip</i> my card. Of course - my first thought was of guacamole. (In my own defense I was rather hungry.)

Then I get to the hotel and when trying to find my room, noticed that all the room numbers were even. I return to the elevators and to confirm my suspicion, there was indeed a sign that pointed out that even rooms were to the right and <i>uneven</i> rooms were to the left. I guess "odd" would have been too short of a word. ;)

p.s. Am I the only one who finds <i>so</i> many hotels confusing? It's like they don't want you to find your room. Or leave it.
