Anyone seen an issue where clicking a link in Thunderbird takes a <i>really</i> long time to load up in Firefox? Firefox acts normally, but Thunderbird locks up during this time. It normally isn't more than 30-40 seconds, but obviously links should load immediately. It doesn't happen all the time, but roughly 80-90% of the time. So - has anyone seen this?
