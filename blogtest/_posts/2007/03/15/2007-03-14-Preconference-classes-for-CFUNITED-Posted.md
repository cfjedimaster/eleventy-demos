If you want to learn even more at CFUNITED, please check the <a href="http://cfunited.com/blog/index.cfm/2007/3/14/CFUnited-Preconference-classes-posted">list</a> of pre-conference classes</a>. 

I'd like to point out two classes. I do not know the material behind them - so take these recommendations with a grain of salt. First is Nate's "Advanced Database" class. Way too many of us (myself included!) do not use the database enough. Secondly - Charlie Arehart's class, "New in CFMX 6&7: What Did You Miss?" Many of the questions I get cover things that people simply didn't know existed in ColdFusion. If you have been too busy to really get into the MX features, this could be the perfect class for you.
