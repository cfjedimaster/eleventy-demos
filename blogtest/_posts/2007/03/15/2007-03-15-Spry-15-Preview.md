Big news in Spry-land tonight - the <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/spry/preview/">1.5 Preview</a> has gone live, and wow, there are some great things here. I won't cover everything new in the preview, check the <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/spryteam/">Spry blog</a> for that - but here are some of the high points:
<!--more-->
<ul>
<li>JSON Support - probably the most requested new feature. Spry not speaks JSON. Yesterday I <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2007/3/14/Quick-example-of-JSON-versus-XML">blogged</a> about how JSON compared to XML. I am <i>very</i> happy to see Spry support JSON finally.
<li>HTML DataSets - Now this is just plain sexy as hell. You can use Spry to suck in data from an existing HTML table - either on the same page or a different page. If for some reason you can't get access to simple XML or JSON, you can instead simply point Spry to an HTML table.
<li>PagedView - The Spry team had released support for paging before, and this looks like an even nicer version of the last preview.
<li>An <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/spry/preview/articles/data_api/">API</a>! Finally - a simple doc to help you use Spry. If you are like me and know that Spry can do something, but can't remember the exact function name, this will be a big help.
</ul>

So again - this is just a preview and not the official release, but it definitely looks like great things are ahead. In the days that come I'll follow up this post with some additional examples. Enjoy!
