I just released <a href="http://lighthousepro.riaforge.org">Lighthouse Pro 2.3</a>. This has one big new feature - email support. You can now configure LHP projects to check a particular email account for bug reports. Even better - the project will look for a particular email address. That means you can use one email account, but multiple email aliases for your projects. LHP reads the email - creates the issue - and then deletes the mail from the server.

This also makes it easier to create a public facing bug report form for your projects. You can simply set up a form to send email to the proper address and your users will have an even easier way to report bugs.

Enjoy.
