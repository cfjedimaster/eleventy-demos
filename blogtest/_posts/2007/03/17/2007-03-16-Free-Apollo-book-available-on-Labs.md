Adobe Labs has released a free Apollo book, 

<a href="http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Apollo:Books:Apollo_for_Adobe_Flex_Developers_Pocket_Guide"> Apollo:Books:Apollo for Adobe Flex Developers Pocket Guide</a>

This book clocks in at 108 pages and considering the price (again, free), it is something you should pick up if you are going to start playing with Apollo. It even has a mini-Cookbook, which I'm a big fan of.<p><a href='enclosures/D{% raw %}%3A%{% endraw %}5Cwebsites{% raw %}%5Cdev%{% endraw %}2Ecamdenfamily{% raw %}%2Ecom%{% endraw %}5Cenclosures{% raw %}%2F397818531%{% endraw %}5Fabfdfd9cd0{% raw %}%5Fm%{% endraw %}2Ejpg'>Download attached file.</a></p>
