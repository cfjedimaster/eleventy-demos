I thought I'd point out this Adobe Edge article by Brian Rinaldi:

<a href="http://www.adobe.com/newsletters/edge/march2007/articles/article6/index.html?trackingid=RUUK">Add dynamic content to your site with RSS
and ColdFusion</a>

His article talks about how to use my <a href="http://cfrss.riaforge.org/">RSS.cfc</a> project (which Brian provided fixes for in the last version) to download and parse various RSS feeds into your ColdFusion site.
