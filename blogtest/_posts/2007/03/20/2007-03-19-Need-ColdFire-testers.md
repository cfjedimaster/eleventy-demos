I <a href="http://coldfire.riaforge.org/blog/index.cfm/2007/3/20/Need-folks-to-test">blogged it</a> over on RIAForge, but in case folks miss it, I checked into Subversion a new coldfire.cfm file that should fix the "Everything breaks, can't change pages, etc" bug. If you get this new version, <b>nothing</b> will show up in the ColdFire panel, but it should correct the issue. Once folks have confirmed the fix I'll ask Adam to update the browser side. ColdFire may be found here: <a href="http://coldfire.riaforge.org">http://coldfire.riaforge.org</a>.  Remember to get from SVN, not the zip.
