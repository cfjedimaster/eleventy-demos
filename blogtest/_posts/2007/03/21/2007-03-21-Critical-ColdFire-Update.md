Sorry for the flurry of blog posts today (is anyone actually reading <i>all</i> of these??). <a href="http://coldfire.riaforge.org">ColdFire</a> was updated today and it should now work for most people. I do have one user still reporting problems (and there are still bugs logged in the tracker I haven't hit yet), but the main "Too Big Header" bug should now be gone. Long Live JSON.

And to brag a bit - ColdFire is about 1.5 weeks old now and is currently sitting at #5 on RIAForge.org (in terms of downloads).
