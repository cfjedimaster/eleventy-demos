I've released an update to <a href="http://www.riaforge.org">RIAForge</a> today that lets project owners run a host wiki on the site. This is mainly meant for documentation but could be used for just about anything really. FAQs are a good example.

The wiki is Canvas 2.0, which is <i>almost</i> ready for release. I discovered some case issues (you will never convince me there is a need for case sensitive file systems) that I need to roll into the core Canvas 2 for a final RC release. I'm hoping to do that before I head out to Vegas next week. (<a href="http://www.startrekexp.com/">Star Trek Experience</a> - here I come...)
