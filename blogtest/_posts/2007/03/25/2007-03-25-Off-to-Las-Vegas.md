For the third time in less than a year I'm off to Las Vegas. Last time it was MAX. Now I'm heading out to meet with a client and help them out with a redesign of their web site. I don't gamble, but I love the desert and I'm looking forward to seeing it again. Of course, this means it is time to play "What will happen to Ray on the Plane" again. Something tells me this will be a perfect flight. I've already gotten an earlier flight from Lafayette and am on stand by for an earlier flight to LV as well.
