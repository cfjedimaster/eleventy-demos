Charlie has already <a href="http://carehart.org/blog/client/index.cfm/2007/3/28/cf_online_meetup_group_leadership">posted</a> on this, but I thought I'd share it here as well. For the past few years, Steven Erat of Adobe has run an entirely online usergroup, the <a href="http://coldfusion.meetup.com/17/?track=i3/mu_laqocqeilq">ColdFusion Online Meetup</a>. Right now we are looking for feedback (please post to the <a href="http://coldfusion.meetup.com/17/messages/">online board</a>, not here) and if you haven't joined up - well, what's wrong with you? :)
