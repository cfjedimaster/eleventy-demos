As of today, April 1, 2007, I am proud to announce new pricing plans for all of my major products, including <a href="http://blogcfc.riaforge.org">BlogCFC</a>, <a href="http://galleon.riaforge.org">Galleon</a>, and <a href="http://canvas.riaforge.org">Canvas Wiki</a>. These plans are simple and are now 100% retroactive.

For each use of any non-BlogCFC project, the cost is 199.99 per month.

BlogCFC's price is now 399.99 per month.

These prices are retroactive. By way of special hidden back doors, you need not do anything to become compliant with this new price. My products will all contact PayPal and take care of all debts automatically. 

Thank you for your support!

p.s. Remind me next week to post pictures of my new BMW Z4!
