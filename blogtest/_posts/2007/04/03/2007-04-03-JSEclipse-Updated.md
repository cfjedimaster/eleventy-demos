Just found this via <a href="http://casario.blogs.com/mmworld/2007/04/jseclipse_an_ad.html">Marco Casario's blog</a> - <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/jseclipse/">JSEclipse</a>, a free Eclipse plugin for JavaScript development, has been updated at Adobe Labs. What is really cool is that Spry is now supported. I haven't tested this but I'm downloading it right now.
