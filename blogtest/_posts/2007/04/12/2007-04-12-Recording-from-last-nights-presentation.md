If you missed my presentation last night (and are one one of the 5 people who haven't seen me blather on about <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/spry">Spry</a>), then you can view it here:

I've attached a zip of the files to this entry. Again - if you saw my earlier Spry presentations, this is nothing new. What I'd love to do is have an all day class on Spry and ColdFusion. That would be, in the words of Paris, hot.<p><a href='enclosures/D{% raw %}%3A%{% endraw %}5Cwebsites{% raw %}%5Cdev%{% endraw %}2Ecamdenfamily{% raw %}%2Ecom%{% endraw %}5Cenclosures{% raw %}%2Fsprypreso3%{% endraw %}2Ezip'>Download attached file.</a></p>
