A week or so ago I mentioned my next CFJUG (ColdFusion Jedi User Group) meeting topic but didn't schedule it. I now have a date for it - Monday, April 30th at 5PM CST. This is a bit earlier than I normally do, but hopefully it will still work for folks.

The meeting topic will be an overview of ColdFusion data structures. Lists, Structure, Arrays, Lions, Tigers, etc. Basically I'll be talking about the various forms of data within ColdFusion and how you can work with them. This class is for beginners (although experts are invited to join in for heckling purposes).
