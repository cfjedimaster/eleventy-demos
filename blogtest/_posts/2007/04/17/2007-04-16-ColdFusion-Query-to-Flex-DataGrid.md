Kyle Hayes has posted an <b>excellent</b> captivate demo that walks you through hooking up a Flex DataGrid to a ColdFusion query. He covers the complete process from Flex Project creation to writing the ColdFusion CFC. This is an excellent demonstration for folks who are having a hard time wrapping their head around the process.
