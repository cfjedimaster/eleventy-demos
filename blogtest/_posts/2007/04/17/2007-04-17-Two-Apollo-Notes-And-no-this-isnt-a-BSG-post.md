First, an announcement. Adobe, Creation Chamber and Xylem Interactive are hosting <a href="http://apolloranch.eventbrite.com/">Apollo Ranch</a>, a <b>free</b> one night conference on Apollo. The conference is being held in Boulder, CO on May 5th and runs from 5 to 11:30 PM - which I think is pretty cool actually. (Of course, I think I gave a 1AM presentation to New Zealand a few weeks back.)

Secondly, I'll be presenting to the <a href="http://www.kcdevcore.org/">Kansas City UG</a> tomorrow night on Apollo. The meeting will be online at: <a href="http://adobechats.adobe.acrobat.com/rayonapollo/">http://adobechats.adobe.acrobat.com/rayonapollo/</a>

I'll be honest (as I was with KS) that I'm new to Apollo, so I'll probably make a mistake or two, but I'll be sharing what I've learned so far and what my take is on the technology.
