This was announced a bit earlier on Ben's blog (but will probably get ignored because of some <a href="http://www.forta.com/blog/index.cfm/2007/4/18/Is-That-What-Desperation-Looks-Like">other boring post</a>), but the ColdFusion 8 edition of CFWACK (ColdFusion Web Application Construction Kit) is now in development. The big announcement is that the series will move from 2 books to 3.
