Hey, buddy. Yeah, you. You wanna some new releases? How about...

<a href="http://blogcfc.riaforge.org">BlogCFC 5.7.001</a> - Includes updated RSS and Search code

<a href="http://canvas.riaforge.org">Canvas 2</a> - Yes. Finally. Includes... um, a whole lot of stuff. It still doesn't have an upgrade script for 1.5, but I'm not the first person to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/default.mspx">release</a> a delayed project out of just pure frustration. Mark Mazelin gets credit for 99% of Canvas 2. He was done <i>months</i> ago. This is my fault.

<a href="http://harlan.riaforge.org">Harlan 1.0.4</a> - The ColdFusion Ad Server so poorly written it <a href="http://ooine.com/index.cfm?commentID=327">sends people to PHP</a>!

<a href="http://lighthousepro.riaforge.org/">Lighthouse Pro 2.3.004</a> - This is just a minor bug fix.
