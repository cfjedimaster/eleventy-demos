Next Monday I'll be presenting on ColdFusion Data Structures. This is a free meeting over <strike>Breeze</strike>Connect. It will be held at 5pm. I'll post the meeting URL the day of the meeting.

My <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2007/4/16/ColdFusion-Newbie-Contest-Announced--Monster-Maker">Newbie Contest</a> is under way. You have three more weeks to submit. I've gotten one submission so far and my god is it horrible. If you enter you will be sure to win. (JUST KIDDING!) I can announce one prize now - a ticket to CFUNITED 07. All you have to cover is airfare and hotel. Thats a 1000 dollar prize right there.
