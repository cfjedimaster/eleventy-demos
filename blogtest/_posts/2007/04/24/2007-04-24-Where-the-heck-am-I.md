I'm here - just busy as heck. I was planning on installing Ubuntu today on a new partition when Partition Magic decided it would rather just screw up my drive. Now Windows won't boot and since Dell couldn't be bothered to ship me an install disk (well, maybe they did, but I have no idea where it is), I'm having to borrow an ISO and do a reinstall. Ugh. Luckily my Mac laptop was setup well for development so I'm on that for the next day or two.
