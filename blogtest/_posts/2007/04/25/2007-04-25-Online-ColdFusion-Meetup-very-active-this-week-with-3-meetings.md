The <a href="http://coldfusion.meetup.com/17/">Online ColdFusion Meetup</a> group will be very active this week (unlike this blog). 

The first meeting will be Steve Bryant presenting on the DataMgr Component Set. This meeting will be on Thursday at 5PM Central. Info and RSVP here: <a href="http://coldfusion.meetup.com/17/calendar/5667225/">http://coldfusion.meetup.com/17/calendar/5667225/</a>

The next two meetings are previews of presentations being held at cf.Objective next week (which reminds me - be prepared for my travel horror stories). At 9:30 AM on Friday, Dean Saxe will present on "Security and the SLDC".
