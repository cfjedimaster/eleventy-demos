As you can tell by the lack of blog postings (except for those  of me complaining), I'm still behind on my email and my open source projects. In case folks are curious - there is a major update to <a href="http://coldfire.riaforge.org">ColdFire</a> in the wings - written by a user (I didn't forget you buddy, your email is still on the dead PC). I'm going to try to get that out before the end of this week.

Lastly - <a href="http://scottpinkston.org/blog/">Scott Pinkston</a> spent more than half a day today helping me with Ubuntu. I've got my primary screen at 1600xSomething resolution, but for the life of me I can't get it to the proper 1920xSomething resolution that my Dell monitor supports. I've tried all the guides and yet I just can't get it working. I haven't even tried my second monitor yet. If you are an Ubuntu user and use Dell's 24 inch monitor, let me know. (Oh, and I could use a good graphic IRC client. I know the folks there miss me. Really.)
