A few days ago I blogged about how Mozy had saved my life with my recent computer troubles. I mentioned that the Mac version was in beta, but it wasn't really public quite yet. That has changed. Mozy now has <a href="https://mozy.com/mozy/macmozy">openly released</a> the Mac Beta version. If you downloaded the version from Scott Pinkston, grab it again as this is a newer build.
