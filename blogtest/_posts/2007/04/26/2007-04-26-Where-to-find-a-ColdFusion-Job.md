I had a reader ping me yesterday about finding a job. He is in India and looking to telecommute. I sent a standard list of job sites, but I thought I'd open the discussion up and create a truly great list of places folks can go for ColdFusion work. Please add your comments and as you do, I'll edit this list for future reference.
