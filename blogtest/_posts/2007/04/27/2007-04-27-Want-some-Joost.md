Kyle Hayes is giving away some <a href="http://www.kylehayes.info/blog/index.cfm/2007/4/27/Another-Batch-of-Joost-Invites">Joost invites</a> over on his blog. All you have to do is answer the oh so serious question: If Paris Hilton were a ColdFusion tag, what would she be? 

What better way to spend Friday?

I installed Joost myself, and while the content isn't terribly exciting yet, it works <i>really</i> darn well. I can see myself watching TV on the platform once the content improves.
