Tonight I'll be presenting (over Connect) a meeting on ColdFusion variable datatypes. I'll be talking about the various forms of datatypes available to ColdFusion, specifically focusing on the things that may be confusing to newbies. (And to be clear, this is a presentation for folks new to ColdFusion.) 

This meeting will be held at 5PM Central. It will be on Connect and I'll be posting the meeting URL a little bit later in the day. I'll post the URL to this entry, so if you want to attend tonight, just visit this entry. (I'm posting now as I'll be gone most of the morning.)

For those who cannot make the meeting, it will be recorded.
