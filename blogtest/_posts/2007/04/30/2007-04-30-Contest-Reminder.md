Just a quick reminder about my <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2007/4/16/ColdFusion-Newbie-Contest-Announced--Monster-Maker">ColdFusion contest</a>. You have until May 15th to get your submissions in. I've gotten 2 so far and they are pretty darn cool. <i>Please</i> tell me I'm going to have a lot more. If you are a newbie and are a bit worried - do not be. This will be a totally painless learning experience - and a chance to win some nice prizes. Ok? (Do I sound like I'm begging yet?)
