With the recent crash of my Windows PC, I decided to accelerate my purchase of a Mac desktop. I just got an email that it shipped early! I didn't go for the 8 core (4 core should be enough to run Enclipse, shoot, maybe even Dreamweaver), but I'm pretty excited about this machine. I'll soon be 100% Mac!

I did get Ubuntu running ok, but, honestly, I just want something I can be effective in and not spend a lot of time worrying about making a small configuration change that will bring down the whole machine.
