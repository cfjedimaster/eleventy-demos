The info on Scorpio (ColdFusion 8) just gets better and better...

First check out <a href="http://www.daveshuck.com/blog/index.cfm/2007/5/1/My-notes-and-analysis-of-Ben-Fortas-presentation-to-the-DFWCFUG">Dave Shuck's blog post</a> on Ben Forta's last Scorpio presentation. He lists out what Ben discussed including a lot of the new AJAX stuff and CFINTERFACE.

Next - Ben <a href="http://www.forta.com/blog/index.cfm/2007/5/2/Working-With-JSON-In-Scorpio">reveals</a> that Scorpio will support JSON, which is <i>very</i> good news since Spry will support it, and JSON is <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2007/3/14/Quick-example-of-JSON-versus-XML">much slimmer</a> than XML.

Lastly, if you were at my <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2007/5/1/CFJUG-Recording-and-Materials">last presentation</a>, you heard me reveal another new Scorpio function. To be 100% clear, I was given permission by Adobe to mention it so this is NOT a sign that the NDA isn't in effect. Scorpio adds a function that checks for the existence of an array element. No need for a UDF or try/catch anymore if you have arrays that potentially have null elements.
