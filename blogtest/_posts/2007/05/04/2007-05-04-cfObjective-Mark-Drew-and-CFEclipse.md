Mark Drew has announced frameworks support for CFEclipse and let me say - it looks incredibly sexy. He demonstrated support for Fusebox, Reactor, Model-Glue, and other frameworks. The plugin is even able to automatically determine your framework automatically, which is just incredible. Mark says the frameworks are configured by XML, and that Transfer support, for example, was added in about 5 minutes.
