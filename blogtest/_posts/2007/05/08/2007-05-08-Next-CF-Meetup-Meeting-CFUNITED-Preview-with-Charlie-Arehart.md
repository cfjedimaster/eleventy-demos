The next meeting of the CF Meetup user group will be held on May 10th, 2007 at 12:30 PM. Charlie Arehart will give a preview of his session at CFUNITED on features you may have missed in CFMX6 and 7. 

Trust me - you are not using everything you could be in CF. (I include myself in this group.)

For more information, and to RSVP, go to the <a href="http://coldfusion.meetup.com/17/calendar/5756012/">event detail</a>.

As a reminder - this is completely free for anyone and everyone.
