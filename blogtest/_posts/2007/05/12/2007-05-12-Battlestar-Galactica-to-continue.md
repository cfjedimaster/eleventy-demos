Batllestar Galactica (also known as the best show on tv) was recently rumored to be ending its run after the 4th season. Now Sci Fi Wire is <a href="http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=2&id=41457">reporting otherwise</a>. Not only is the 4th season not the last (well, not now anyway), but the original report had said that there would only be 13 episodes. Now they are saying it will be a full 22. 

Season 3 was absolutely amazing, and frankly I'm surprised it didn't get more press than it did, <i>especially</i> with the 'pro suicide bomber' thread in the beginning. It fit well in the story but considering todays political climate it was a pretty gutsy call to make. The ending of season 3 was also pretty darn good. I've watched the last 5 minutes about, oh, 15 times now.
