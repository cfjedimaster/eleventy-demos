This is just a reminder that entries for my <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2007/4/16/ColdFusion-Newbie-Contest-Announced--Monster-Maker">contest</a> are due on Tuesday. I've gotten some good entries already and am hoping to have a few more. As a reminder - this contest is for beginners, and you should not be afraid to send your entry in. The point isn't to make fun or tease your code, but rather to help you (and my readers) learn. I've seen beginners do stuff that is actually pretty cool before so if you are on the fence - just do it!
