So earlier today I <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2007/5/15/Coolest-Windows-Feature-Ever">ripped on Windows</a>, which, admittedly, isn't hard to do. But it is only fair that I give OS X some love as well. 

I was in the process of copying a large set of files (legally owned, I swear) from the Mac to the USB drive when I encountered error -36. 

Not having any idea what that was I did quick Google and came across this page: <a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=9805">Mac  OS System Error Code</a>. If you scroll down to -36 you will see (emphasis mine):

<blockquote>
I/O error <b>(bummers)</b>
</blockquote>

Bummers?!? There is no way a major computer company would write a support page that said bummers! I'd say it... but Apple? No way!
