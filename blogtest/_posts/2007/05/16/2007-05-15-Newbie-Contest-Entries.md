Just to ensure I didn't miss anyone due to a spam filter or the chaos of switching platforms, here are the people that have sent me contest entries. If your name is not on this list and you sent me a file, please post a comment here, don't email.

<ul>
<li>Simeon</li>
<li>John Ramon</li>
<li>Joel Watson</li>
<li>Phillip Senn</li>
<li>Alexei Protasov</li>
<li>Rob Makowski</li>
<li>Nick Sweeney</li>
<li>Jay Cunnington</li>
<li>Johnathon Stierman</li>
</ul>

My plan is to start reviews on Monday. Since one of the prizes is a CFUNITED ticket, I need to wrap this one up rather quickly.
