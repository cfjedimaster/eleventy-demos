At cfObjective, Jason Delmore of Adobe had a cool slide showing the history of ColdFusion. I bugged him into sending me the slide, and when I didn't have the fonts, I bugged him again for the PDF export. (You can ask various people on the CF team - I'm good at bugging folks.) Anyway - here it is:

<a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/downloads/historyslide-1.pdf">ColdFusion - A Little History</a>

It doesn't go into great detail (it is just one slide), but could be useful for managers wanting a high level timeline.
