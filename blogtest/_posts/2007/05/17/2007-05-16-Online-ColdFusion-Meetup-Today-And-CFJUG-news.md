At 11:30 CST today Simon Horwith will be presenting a preview of his CFUNITED full day class. For more information, and to RSVP, please visit the <a href="http://coldfusion.meetup.com/17/calendar/5778241/">site</a>. Just in case folks don't know - this is a 100% free, online meeting.

Speaking of 100% and online, the CFJUG (Jedi User Group) meeting may be pushed back a bit. I had said 'End of May' sometime, but with the downtime the last few weeks with my hardware, I want to push it a bit more. I'm going to aim for the first week of June. This meeting will be an introduction to custom tags. (Followed by UDFs and CFCs later in the summer.)
