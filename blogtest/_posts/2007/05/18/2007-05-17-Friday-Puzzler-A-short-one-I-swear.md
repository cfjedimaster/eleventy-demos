Ok, so after posting a few puzzles that were, um, not quite simple, I thought it would be nice to post something that you actually could solve rather quickly. This one is <b>very</b> simple, and I almost didn't post it, but I have a soft spot for string parsing (I started my web dev life in Perl) so I thought this could be fun.

You are a newly employed member of the CIA. Your job is to help catch dumb spies using an encryption technique where the first letter of every line is a message. What do I mean? Consider this letter:

<blockquote>
Berry told me he had lost his<br />
umbrella last night when<br /> 
sailing with his friends.<br />
<br />
He really is kind of stupid.<br /> 
Really. I mean, how dumb<br /> 
of a person do you have to be to<br /> 
collapse on a moving bock and hurt your<br />
knees while<br /> 
sailing?<br />
</blockquote>

In case it isn't obvious, read down the first column of letters and you will see "BushRocks". Yes, I'm joking, but after all the times I teased him I figured my (poor) Republican readers needed a break. ;) 

So your task is to simply parse a string and get the first column of letters.
