This is going to be a short post. Lost airs here 9-11 and it is approaching midnight here and since my body still thinks it is 2 AM, I'm quite tired. 

Before I touch the whole WTF part of the show - let me just say that this show had some of the best lines ever. The whole Sawyer/Evil Blonde Chick (yes, I forgot her name again) conversation was classic. Charlie's part was also great. I've said before that he wasn't my favorite character, but tonight he really shone. (And then he died. Ah well.)

What about that map that Ben had? Did anyone else seem to think it looked a little bit... I don't know, Playskool? My friend said it looked like he went to the Lost Restaurant and that was the place mat. Seemed kind of silly for him to be doing precise measurements on it.

So now the big question is.... what in the heck are they going to do for three more seasons? I mean - they left the island, and while life sucked for Jack (and possibly Kate), what can the writers do now? If the whole thing was a dream... well that would be a major copout. If they spend the next three seasons showing what happened to folks... that would just plain suck. I'd almost rather them simply end now. It <i>would</i> be a great way to end. Sure, they wouldn't have answered everything (Black Smoke/Giant Foot/Hurley still fat), but from a story perspective, it would be a great way to go out.

So here is my question folks - what in the you know what are they going to do next?
