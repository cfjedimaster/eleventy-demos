Not that many people use it - but I updated <a href="http://harlan.riaforge.org">Harlan AdServer</a> today. Harlan is a simple ad server program that lets you create and track ads and campaigns. Today's update is something I should have added a long time ago - the ability to reset stats for ads or campaigns.
