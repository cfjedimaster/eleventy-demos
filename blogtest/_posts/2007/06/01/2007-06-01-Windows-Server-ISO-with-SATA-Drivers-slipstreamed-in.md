Taking a wild chance here. If anyone has built their own Windows Server ISO with SATA drivers baked in, please contact me off list. I have a valid license for Windows Server 2003, but am stuck trying to rebuild my old Dell since I have SATA drives and no floppy. (Yes, I know I can build one myself. I tried - but just got too ticked off and lost all my patience. :) Have I mentioned how much I don't like Windows anymore?
