Just a quick post to point out a link to tech spot:

<a href="http://www.techspot.com/vb/topic18329.html">Error Message:Setup did not find any hard disk drives installed in your system</a>

This finally solved my problem of Windows not being able to find my hard drives. Specifically this <a href="http://www.techspot.com/vb/post146731-3.html">post</a>.  I'm still not 100% sure why this fixed things, but I was able to get Windows Server 2003 installed at least. (Now I just need to get some drivers for my Ethernet card.)
