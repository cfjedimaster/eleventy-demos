Forgive the simple cross post - but I wanted to point out Mark Drew's latest blog post:

<a href="http://www.markdrew.co.uk/blog/index.cfm/2007/6/4/Project-X-unveiled-Say-a-big-hello-to-SnipEx">Project X unveiled: Say a big hello to SnipEx</a>

This is an uber-cool new feature coming to CFEclipse - remote snippets. This even includes integration with CFLib. You will be able to insert a UDF right into your document all via CFEclipse. (Hey Mark, you going to reimburse my Adsense loss?? ;)
