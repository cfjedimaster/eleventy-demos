The title says it all. I am <b>very</b> proud to announce that Yahoo has launched the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/coldfusion/">ColdFusion Developer Center</a> with tips and articles on how to use various Yahoo services with the One True Programming Language (sorry, couldn't resist). I bugged Yahoo about this and when they finally came back to me and asked me to write it up - I'm the one who didn't have time. So any delay in this launching was all my fault - but I'm just glad it is finally there! Yahoo has a <a href="http://developer.yahoo.net/blog/archives/2007/06/coldfusion_in_t.html">blog entry</a> on it as well, so please show your thanks there and let them know you appreciate it.

I said it earlier this year. This is the year we make the world know our language. I don't need everyone to like ColdFusion - but I want the world to know our name. I want them to respect us. (I know I can say I respect .Net and PHP!) And this is the last gosh darn year I want to see "ColdFusion is dead". If I sound a bit fanatical, well, I probably am. But this is my crusade this year, and I know I've got lots of help!
