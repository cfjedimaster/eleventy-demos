I'm a bit late announcing this (hotel net connection had issue with POP), but the Teratech folks have announced that <a href="http://europe.cfunited.com/">CFUnited is going to Europe</a>. The web site doesn't have much yet (I can't even find the <i>dates</i> yet), but this is good news for folks who couldn't make the trip to the states.
