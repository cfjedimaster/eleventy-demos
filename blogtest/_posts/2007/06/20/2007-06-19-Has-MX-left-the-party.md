I don't think I've seen anyone comment on this - but it seems like ColdFusion 8 drops the "MX" from the title. Prior to CF8 we have ColdFusion MX and ColdFusion MX 7. I would have expected ColdFusion MX 8, but all signs point to a simple ColdFusion 8. 

Certainly not a big deal - but has anyone seen "official" confirmation on the MX going bye-bye?

Folks may not remember, but when MX was added, there was a lot of talk about what MX stood for. Macromedia refused to ever say, but some executive accidentally let it slip that it stood for.... I forget. ;) Shows you how important it was to me. I did find this old <a href="http://www.itwriting.com/mxinterview.php">interview with Jeremy Allaire</a> where he mentions MX didn't stand for anything in particular. And <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/jd_forum/jd004.html">here</a> is an old article by John Dowdell</a> saying basicaly the same. 

So - will anyone miss it? I personally don't care. I know I'm in the minority - but I kinda liked the Windows "year" thing. (Windows 95, 98, 2000.) To me it made it very easy to 'date' a release. Can you imagine a ColdFusion 2007?
