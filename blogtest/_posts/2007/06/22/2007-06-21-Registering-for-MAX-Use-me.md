Ok, so "use me" may not be a great title, but if you are considering <a href="https://secure.adobemax2007.com/na/register/">registering for MAX</a>, please do the following:

<blockquote>
On the third page of the registration process at the top of the page there is a box to check that says "Check here if you are a member of a community or user group."  Checking that will pop up another text box that says "Please input your community leader or user group manager's name".
</blockquote>

On this page you would enter my name as a referral. Now as a speaker, I've got a free pass anyway, but a) I want to drive people to register and b) the top referral "driver" gets a brand new top of the line MacBook Pro!

Note - Only do this if you aren't a member of a local user group. If you are a member of a local user group, use your own manager's name, not mine!
