CFUNITED is hosting a set of <a href="http://cfunited.com/go/topics#track-birdsoffeather">Birds of a Feather</a> at CFUNITED. These are more informal and casual meetings as opposed to the normal "Guy with Powerpoint" presentation. There a quite a few good ones. Here are a few I want to point out:

<a href="http://www.infoaccelerator.net/index.cfm?event=showEntry&entryId=6602C9DF-FF30-C9A3-AD81491461CA13FC">CFUnited BOF: AIR and Flex Fears Debunked</a> - Andrew Powell talks about AIR and Flex specifically in terms of a ColdFusion developer.

<a href="http://www.firemoss.com/blog/index.cfm?mode=entry&entry=65B4B26F-3048-55C9-43A64C845A3892A1">Frameworks BOF</a> - Joe Rinehart discusses frameworks. As the creator of Model-Glue, I'm sure this will be nice and unbiased. ;) (Just kidding Joe!)

I'm running a Birds of a Feather Wednesday night on 8 on open source development. This will be an discussion on how developers can move into the open source world.
