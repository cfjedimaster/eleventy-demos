The title says it all. You can now grab the 2.0 version of Model-Glue from the new shiny website at:

I'm going to do a few MG 2 blog posts once I return from CFUNITED. 

Along with MG 2 for ColdFusion, Joe has released a version of <a href="http://www.model-glue.com/flex.cfm">Model-Glue for Flex</a>. I've yet to have a chance to play with this, but I'm pretty darn excited. I'm still a newbie at Flex and I could really use some guidance!<p><a href='enclosures/C{% raw %}%3A%{% endraw %}5Chosts{% raw %}%5Cwww%{% endraw %}2Ecoldfusionjedi{% raw %}%2Ecom%{% endraw %}5Cenclosures{% raw %}%2Fmgnew%{% endraw %}2Epng'>Download attached file.</a></p>
