Once again I'm sitting in the airport in Lafayette about to fly off. This time though it is to CFUNITED and I'm giddy with excitement. Ok, maybe not giddy per se. But I'm grinning like the Cheshire Cat and can't wait to arrive. So far everything is on time, but with Delta, who knows what will happen.

And now for the few random notes. First off - I never told folks what happened last time I traveled. I got to the airport early enough where I was able to take an earlier flight. So the trip began pretty darn nice. Or so I thought. The plane taxis out to the end of the runway, and when we turn to take off, I noticed the engines weren't revving up. In fact, we were driving back towards the terminal! At this point I'm a bit ticked because a) my bad luck had kicked in again and b) the pilot was saying anything. But we drove past the terminal and went to the <i>other</i> runway. I figured that maybe it was just a switch in take off patterns. But then we wait. And wait. Finally the pilot comes on and says that we are waiting because... wait for it... the brakes were too hot. That's a new one for me. We eventually did take off though and the rest of the flight was fine.

Next random note: I absolutely freaking love the new shorthand struct/array creation in ColdFusion 8:

<code>
&lt;cfset myarr = [1,2,4,8,16]&gt;
&lt;cfset mystruct = {% raw %}{ foo=1, goo=2, zoo="three"}{% endraw %}
</code>

Last random note: I know this is going to tick people off. Today many net radio stations have stopped broadcasting to protest rate hikes. You can find out more at <a href="http://www.savenetradio.org/">SaveNetRadio.org</a>. Frankly, I don't care.

Why would I not care? I love music. I love net radio. 

But frankly, I'm tired. I'm tired of the entire industry. From the RIAA to CRB, I've had enough. If the industry wants to shoot itself in the foot and tick off their fans, I say let them. Maybe this will be the beginning of the end for Big Music and if so - good riddance. I can understand the industry being upset with file sharing, but since this whole mess started with Napster, everything they have done has been one awful mistake after another. (Although to be fair - I should give credit to EMI for going DRM free in iTunes.)
