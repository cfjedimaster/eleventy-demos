For those of you running BlogCFC, do not forget that you can update your spam list with my copy by visiting http://www.raymondcamden.com/tbspam.cfm. I'm not hot linking as I'd rather not have Google follow it and index it. I'm brining it up now as I just had a rash of attacks come in and I had to update it for a new spammer. It would be cool if BlogCFC 6 had an option to connect and update the local spam list from a central server on BlogCFC.com. By the way - we are all adults here, but on the off chance that you easily offended, you probably don't want to visit that link directly.
