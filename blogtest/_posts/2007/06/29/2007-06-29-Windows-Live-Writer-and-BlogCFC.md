I added XML-RPC support back to BlogCFC a few versions ago, and promptly forgot about it, mainly because it was a royal pain in the you know what to test and work with it. But I know that some people prefer using XML-RPC clients to write their blog entries so I was happy to add it. Dan Vega has written an excellent <a href="http://www.danvega.org/blog/index.cfm/2007/6/29/Windows-Live-Writer-amp-BlogCFC-Part-II">article</a> which walks you through setting up Windows Live Writer (an XML-RPC client) and connecting it to BlogCFC. (I'm almost tempted to start working on AIR client, but if reading requests from XML-RPC was bad, I can't imagine what generating them would be like.)
