The MAX BOFs (Birds of a Feather) will be a bit more impressive this year. For the first time, attendees will get a chance to suggest and vote for what BOFs are run. Even better - food and drink will be provided. (Ok, so maybe food is a bit <i>too</i> important to me. :) Ted has all the details over at his blog:

I've run a CFC BOF for the last few years (even reserving a hotel room when it wasn't "officially" chosen by Macromedia), so I'd ask that folks please vote for the BOF once voting actually opens. It's always been a pretty interesting BOF, and we typically get a few Adobe folks in as well.
