Just a quick note to let folks know that RIAForge is now shut down. I've moved all the files to the new server, and Rob Gonda has done the testing for the Subversion. Now I wait for Adobe to update the DNS. I'll have more reports as the night goes on. (And yes - if I sound like I'm being extra careful, extra verbose about all of this - it is because I am. I know a lot of you are using RIAForge and need the site back up as soon as possible!)
