<a href="http://www.riaforge.org">RIAForge</a> is now done moving, and like I expected, it went perfectly without any problems at all. (Ahem.) Just in case you do find a problem, please post it to the <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/forums/threads.cfm?forumid=A08FB783-FFCD-38AC-4A77C6ECF54BAAE4">forum</a> I just set up for RIAForge.
