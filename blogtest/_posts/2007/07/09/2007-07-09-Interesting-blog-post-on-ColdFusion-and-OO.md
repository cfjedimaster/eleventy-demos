This weekend I wrote a simple article on why people use the <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2007/7/7/Ask-a-Jedi-Components-and-the-Init-Method">init method in CFCs</a>. Dale Fraser posted a comment I disagreed with, specifically relating to whether or not ColdFusion is object oriented. I made my feelings quite clear ("CF is not OO. CF should NOT be OO. And lastly, I pray to God that CF never becomes OO.")

Anyway - Dale posted a follow up to our disagreement: <a href="http://dalefraser.blogspot.com/2007/07/coldfusion-is-object-oriented.html">ColdFusion IS Object Oriented</a> I still don't agree with Dale, but I thought I'd point people to his entry for discussion. (And I'm disabling comments here just to ensure folks post there.)
