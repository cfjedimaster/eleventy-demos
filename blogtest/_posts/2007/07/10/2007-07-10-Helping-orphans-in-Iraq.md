I watched a pretty disturbing report last night on the state of orphans in Iraq. More information on the story may be found here:

<a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/07/09/eveningnews/main3035523.shtml">The Orphan He Couldn't Leave Behind</a>

The story details an American soldier who adopted an orphan from Iraq and is trying to help others. The state of the orphans there is incredibly bad. When my wife and I were adopting, one of the reasons we skipped over Russia was due to the state of the orphanages. What I saw on the news last night made Russia look like paradise. I would highly encourage folks to consider helping out as well. CBS has two links here:

<a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/06/19/fyi/main2949887.shtml">How To Help The Baghdad Orphans</a>

One link is just to hook you up with an agency trying to help the orphans while another link is specifically related to adoption.
