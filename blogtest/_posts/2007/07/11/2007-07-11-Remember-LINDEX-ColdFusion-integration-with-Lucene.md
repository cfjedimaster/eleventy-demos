A <i>long</i> time ago, back on DRK 3(*), there was a project released called Lindex. This was a ColdFusion wrapper to the open source Lucene search engine.

If you are the author of this code, or know the name of the person who developed this code, please contact me. I do not need a copy of the code - I've got that. I need to find the author.

* Don't know what the DRK is? Macromedia used to sell what was called a Developer Resource Kit. This was a CD with code for various technologies. Stuff like Galleon, Lighthouse Pro, Soundings, and other projects were born there. Sadly the DRK series was discontinued.
