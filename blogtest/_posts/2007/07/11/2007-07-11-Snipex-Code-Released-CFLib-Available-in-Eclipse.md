Mark Drew has <a href="http://www.markdrew.co.uk/blog/index.cfm/2007/7/11/CFEclipses-SnipEx-server-components-released">released</a> the code for SnipEx. This allows anyone to setup a Snippets server for Eclipse. How is this useful? You can now browse the entire <a href="http://www.cflib.org">CFLib</a> library directly from Eclipse. No more need to ignore my annoying ads. Just add:

http://www.cflib.org/snipex/snipex.cfc

As a SnipEx server. I noticed that the node shows up blank, but when you expand it, you will see all the CFEclipse Libraries and UDFs. You can then click for a description or double click to insert a UDF. How freaking cool is that?

I'm going to be doing a bit of work on the XML when I can. I noticed the libraries are not sorted so I'll try to fix that.
