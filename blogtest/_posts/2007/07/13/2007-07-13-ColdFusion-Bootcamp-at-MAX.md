Ben Forta just <a href="http://www.forta.com/blog/index.cfm/2007/7/13/Build-Your-Own-MAX-Bootcamp-Session">blogged</a> about the ColdFusion Bootcamp at MAX. This is a 3.5 hour session that will be totally driven by those of us attending. Please visit his <a href="http://www.forta.com/blog/index.cfm/2007/7/13/Build-Your-Own-MAX-Bootcamp-Session">post</a> and make some suggestions there. (I've closed off the comments here just to make it obvious.)

As a reminder - if you do plan on attending MAX, see this <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2007/6/22/Registering-for-MAX-Use-me">entry</a> where I discuss how you can help me, or your User Group Manager, win schwag.
