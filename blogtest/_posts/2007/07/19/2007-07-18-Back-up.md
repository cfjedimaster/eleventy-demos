Sorry for the downtime folks. It looks like my little (secret) project went a bit crazy last night and brought down the blog. Bad, Ray, bad! I think I'm almost ready to show off what I've been working with, so I may do so today from the airport. It isn't <i>that</i> terribly exciting, but I promise it will be more entertaining then an interview with Paris Hilton.
