Thanks to everyone who sent in a warning about my site, and <a href="http://www.coldfusionbloggers.org">ColdFusionBloggers.org</a> being down. It looks like the aggregate may be having a hard impact on my box. I'm not quite sure why. The other odd thing is that when the box goes down, I get a butt load of error reports from my blog timing out on print.cfm. It times out when Yahoo tries to slurp up various print links. I almost wonder if it is a mix of the two. 

Either way - I'm trying to fix it - and I'll definitely blog what I find.
