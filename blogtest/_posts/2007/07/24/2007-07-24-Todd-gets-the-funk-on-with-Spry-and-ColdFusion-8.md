Todd just shot me over a link to a new article on his blog:

<a href="http://cfsilence.com/blog/client/index.cfm/2007/7/24/Mashing-Spry-Effects-With-CF8-Ajax-Goodness">Mashing Spry Effects With CF8 Ajax Goodness</a>

It is a rather cool article on using Spry's Effects along with ColdFusion 8 AJAX. It's awesome++.
