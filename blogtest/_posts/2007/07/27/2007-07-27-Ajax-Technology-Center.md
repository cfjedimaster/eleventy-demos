I'm just reposting what I saw on <a href="http://www.reybango.com/index.cfm/2007/7/27/New-Adobe-Ajax-Technology-Center">Rey Bango's blog</a>, Adobe now has an <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/ajax/">Ajax Technology Center</a>. I'd like to see <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/spry/">Spry</a> get more obvious face time there, but it's nice to see.
