Folks, I've submitted a digg and dzone story. Please vote/digg these links to help get them to the front page.

Digg: <a href="http://digg.com/tech_news/ColdFusion_8_Launches">http://digg.com/tech_news/ColdFusion_8_Launches</a>

DZone: <a href="http://www.dzone.com/links/coldfusion_8_launches.html">http://www.dzone.com/links/coldfusion_8_launches.html</a>

<b>Edit:</b> Joshua Cyr <a href="http://www.usefulconcept.com/index.cfm/2007/7/30/Help-Promote-CF-8">mentions</a> he submitted the story to Slashdot. I'm not quite sure how you vote for a site there, but if you still read Slashdot (and who really does anymore), you can push it there.
