While I was blissfully asleep under the power of a Melatonin pill, Adobe decided to go ahead and release <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion/">ColdFusion 8</a>. I think folks know already how strongly I feel about this release. I can honestly say this is the <b>most</b> exciting release I've seen in my entire history with the product. Here are a few links that may be of interest.

<a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion/features/">Features</a>  - This is a good one page sheet that lists a lot of the new features of CF8. Probably a great way to get a non-technical manager up to speed.

<a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/coldfusion/">ColdFusion Developer Center</a> - New articles on ColdFusion 8. There is a cool little Flex widget on here showing blogs that mention ColdFusion 8.

Lastly - not really ColdFusion related, some <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/coldfusion/articles/spotlight_rcamden.html">scary dude</a> was added to the site. I'm not quite sure how that got up there. I'm thinking a hack was involved.
