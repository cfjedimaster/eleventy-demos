Wow, I'm very happy to see that the ColdFusion 8 Extensions for Eclipse (RDS, Log Viewer, Debugger, etc) are now available separately. In the past you could only get them with Flex Builder. You can now download them here:

<a href="http://www.adobe.com/support/coldfusion/downloads.html">ColdFusion Downloads</a>

Also note a separate download for documentation in Eclipse. Those of you using that other editor (Dreamsleaver is it?) or HomeSite+ (folks, it's time to let go) will also find their downloads there as well. (And yes, I'm teasing guys. Please no  hate mail.)
