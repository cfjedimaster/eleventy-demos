A few days ago I posted a quick blog entry on <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2007/7/27/More-on-ColdFusion-8-Server-Alerts">server alerts</a> and where they are stored in the file system. This morning I got an email from Hemant Khandelwal of Adobe with some more interesting follow up - specifically about the naming syntax for these files. 

For files that are generated by ColdFusion (remember my <a href="http://www.coldfusionjedi.com/index.cfm/2007/7/25/Server-Monitor-Alerts-in-ColdFusion-8">initial Server Alerts</a> post where I mentioned you can tell ColdFusion to do a snapshot when an alert is fired), the file name syntax is: snapshot_sysgen_<number>.txt 

For snapshots generated manually by the user the syntax is  snapshot_usrgen_<number>.txt.
