Todd Sharp has released a cool new project on RIAForge: <a href="http://cfimagecropper.riaforge.org/">cfImageCropper</a>. This is a custom tag wrapper to some nice JavaScript code that lets you do image cropping. It is part client side part server server using ColdFusion 8 for the actual image manipulation. Check his <a href="http://cfsilence.com/blog/client/index.cfm/2007/8/2/Introducing-cfImageCropper--Custom-Tag-For-Client-Side-Image-Cropping">blog entry</a> for more information and a link to a cool demo.
