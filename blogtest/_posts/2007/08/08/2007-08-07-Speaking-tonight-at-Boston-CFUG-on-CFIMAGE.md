Tonight I'll be speaking at the <a href="http://www.bostoncfug.org/">Boston CFUG</a> on the new CFIMAGE feature in ColdFusion 8. This is a repeat of my presentation at CFUNITED, so if you missed that, you are welcome to attend. The <strike>Breeze</strike>Connect URL is:

Brian said everyone is welcome to attend as long as they visit the wish list. Seriously. He said that. Kinda.

If you can't attend, I'm sure it will be recorded and posted to the <a href="http://www.bostoncfug.org/">CFUG site</a>.
