Adobe (well, a marketing firm working with Adobe) is looking for people to star in a video for MAX. Details (and pasted doc) are below. Please contact them - not me - for more information.

LOOKING FOR ADOBE USERS IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA TO TAKE PART IN A VIDEO FOR THE ADOBE USERS CONFERENCE.

Are you a designer who uses Photoshop, Illustrator, Flash, or DreamWeaver?

Are you a developer who uses Flash, Flex, or ColdFusion?

Are you in an enterprise business and use LiveCycle or other Adobe products?
 
We're looking for true Adobe enthusiasts to be interviewed on-camera for the production of a video to be shown at the annual Adobe Users Conference in Chicago - Adobe MAX.

Adobe luminaries such as Duane Nickull, Grant Skinner, Eric Natzke, Ben Forta, Mike Chambers, Mike Downey, Raymond Camden, and Mike Sundermeyer will also be taking part in the video.
 
We're looking for all types of people: average users, enthusiastic people, quirky people, people with accents, people that speak different languages, hearing impaired, physically impaired, twins, funky folks... you name it.  We want a vast array of people to represent the Adobe user community.

The video is tentatively scheduled to be shot August 24th, 27th and 28th in San Francisco.  We would need you for just one of those days. The shoot will be short, 1 to 2 hours maximum.

To submit yourself for consideration to be in this production, please email me stating:<br>
-Your occupation<br>
-What Adobe products you use<br>
-A recent photo or two of yourself<br>

Email me at   adobecast@yahoo.com<br>
- Please be sure to include a picture of yourself.<br>
- Contact information.<br>
- We are not having an audition for this so please be detailed in your email.<br>

If interested I will get back to you with more details.

Thank you!!! <br>
