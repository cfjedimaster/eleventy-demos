Just a quick note to let folks know that I've updated the <a href="http://www.coldfusionportal.org/index.cfm">ColdFusion Portal</a>. The main change was in the left hand links. A lot of the documentation has changed around and many of the links needed updating. In case folks are curious as to <i>why</i> I built this - the point was to create a simple way to find ColdFusion resources, with a focus on the basics like downloaders and documentation. The Adobe site is pretty... but... sometimes I just can't find anything on it. I don't know if it is just me - but I have a heck of a time finding stuff there. Especially things like updaters and hot fixes.

Anyway - along with link updates I also fixed the tab's display for the Mac. I'll be updating the books list a bit later in the month. I also changed the MXNA feed to <a href="http://www.coldfusionbloggers.org">ColdFusionBloggers.org</a>.

As always - any suggestions are welcome.
