As the title says, email alerts have been added to <a href="http://www.coldfusionbloggers.org">ColdFusionBloggers.org</a>.  Email alerts are simply keywords that will trigger an email if an entry matching the keyword is aggregrated. Simply sign in, add the keywords you want to monitor, and once an hour the site will check for entries that match.
