At 5:30 PM CST (Cool Standard Time), I'll be presenting to the <a href="http://ctcfug.com/">Hartford CT Adobe User Group</a> over Connect. My presentation will be on ColdFusion 8 and Ajax. (You may have heard CF8 adds a few things in this area. ;) The presentation is open to one and all. URL below:

I'll be showing up around 5 for testing and karaoke.
