I'm running a bit behind today. I had to wake up at 5 (*) and run to New Orleans for - I kid you not - all of 10 minutes - and then drive back home. So while I try to catch up (and consume more coffee) I thought I'd share a tip. <a href="http://www.boyzoid.com/blog/index.cfm">Scott</a> had told me a few weeks ago about his move to <a href="http://www.google.com/a/">Google For Domains</a> (or is it called Google Apps? Not sure...) for his email server. He mentioned the spam filtering along was worth the trouble. I moved a secondary domain last week and had a lot of trouble. This week I moved my primary email and it went a lot better. The main thing is to RTFM - and read it carefully. My problems were all due to simply skimping when reading the docs. 

So with my primary email moved over I can say one thing - I love it. My spam has dropped to about 1% of what it was before. My wife is also seeing the same. That along with the price (free) makes it more than worth the hassle.

* So why would waking up at 5 be a big deal? Most folks know I tend <i>not</i> to sleep. For a while I used to wake up at 4 sometimes. Well for the past month or so I've been taking melatonin, and it's done wonders for my sleep. I sleep all night - no waking up and tossing and turning, and I sleep until the kids or the alarm wake me up. So long story short - I'm no longer Mr. Needs No Sleep - I'm now sleeping like a baby, which unfortunately means more turnaround time for product updates! :)
