If you use Eclipse 3.3 and the ColdFusion 8 plugins (this is <b>not</b> the same as CFElipse, folks should normally have both), please note that Dean over at CFReport.org has released an <a href="http://www.cfreport.org/index.cfm/2007/8/17/Eclipse-33-and-the-ColdFusion-Extensions-for-Eclipse">update</a>. I've tested this myself and it definitely fixed the issue with displaying query results.

p.s. Superbad was super funny.
