I had planned a blog post on this topic this morning, but Andy Jarret beat me to it. I've seen more than one person ask on my blog about how Adobe's CF Extensions compare to CFEclipse. I've seen more than one person confuse them or ask if they need both. Of course you don't <b>need</b> anything outside of Notepad/TextEdit, but you certainly would be <b>recommended</b> to grab both packages. Any way - please read on at Andy's blog for more information:
