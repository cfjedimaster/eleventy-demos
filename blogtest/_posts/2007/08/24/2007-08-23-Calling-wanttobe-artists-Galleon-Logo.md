Galleon 2 is rapidly approaching completion. This will be a major update and with this release I also want to add a new logo since - well - it isn't a proper web application without a shiny logo. I've gotten some darn good logos before, so if you are interested in creating the logo for Galleon 2, please post your samples here. (Obviously you have to give me the right to use it and since I'm cheap your only payment will be fame. :)
