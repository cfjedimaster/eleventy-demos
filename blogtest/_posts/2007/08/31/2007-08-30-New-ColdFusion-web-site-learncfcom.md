Dale Fraser announced today the launch of a new ColdFusion web site, <a href="http://www.learncf.com">learncf.com</a>. What is it? From his About page:

<blockquote>
 The website learncf.com was setup to enable people who are interested in ColdFusion to learn everything about it. The website was designed to bring together all the tutorials that are authored and generally posted on Blogs.

Each tutorial will:

<ol>
<li>Work stand alone
<li>Use the standard ColdFusion demo databases if databases are used
<li>Be downloadable as a .zip file
<li>Will have a link to see the code running
</ol>
</blockquote>
