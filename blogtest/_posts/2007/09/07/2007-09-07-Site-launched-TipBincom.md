Christian Cantrell (Technical Product Manager for AIR) just launched a new site (not Adobe related) called <a
href="http://www.tipbin.com">TipBin</a> where people can share tips about anything in the world. The theory behind TipBin is that everyone knows something that most other people don't, but most of us never get the chance to share it. TipBin is about putting all those valuable pieces of information in one place where the people who need them can find them quickly and easily. If you have something valuable to share,
<a href="http://www.tipbin.com">go check it out</a>. I've added a few tips myself.
