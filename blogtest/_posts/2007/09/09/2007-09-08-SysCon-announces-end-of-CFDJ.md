So I'm a bit late today, but various people have reported the death of CFDJ:

<a href="http://www.blogoffusion.com/index.cfm/2007/9/8/syscon-drops-coldfusion-developers-journal-for-silverlight">Michael Dinowitz</a><br>
<a href="http://www.phusor.com/index.cfm/2007/9/9/Show-Your-Support-for-the-ColdFusion-Community">TJ Downes</a><br>
<a href="http://corfield.org/blog/index.cfm/do/blog.entry/entry/Hurrah_CFDJ_is_dead">Sean Corfield</a><br>

I think I like the attitude of Sean's the best. I'm biting my tongue a bit about this one as I had a friend on the staff there, but in general I've been as disappointed with the magazine as everyone listed above. Like TJ, I'd like to see Sys-Con back up their <a href="http://ajax.sys-con.com/read/426141.htm">statements</a> (normal Sys-Con web site warning applies). 

I know that many people spent a lot of time trying to write good articles for the magazine. I'd encourage them - and <b>all</b> readers of CFDJ, to pick up the <a href="http://www.fusionauthority.com/quarterly/">Fusion Authority Quarterly Update</a>. This is a superbly written magazine with the toughest editors alive. A years subscription is 50 bucks. For 75 bucks you can get a years subscription and all the old issues. This is CHEAP folks! I cannot recommend FAQU enough. If you take one bit of advice from me this year - then please take this and pick up a subscription today.
