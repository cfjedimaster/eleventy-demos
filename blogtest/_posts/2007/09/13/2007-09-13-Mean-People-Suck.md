I probably shouldn't blog this. I'm mad. I had a <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2007/9/13/CS3-doesnt-like-me--can-anyone-help">frustrating</a> day. This is probably the worst time to blog. 

Since I've launched <a href="http://www.coldfusionbloggers.org">ColdFusionBloggers.org</a>, I've had to make a few tweaks because of people intentionally messing with the stats. I used to display the last 10 searches. I removed it. I used to display the top 10 searches. Then I was alerted to <a href="http://blog.brianflove.com/articles/2007/09/13/cf-bloggers-search-stats">this post</a>.

You know... I expected spammers to hit. I expected to see viagra, drugs, RC cars, etc. I didn't really expect to get screwed with by the people I was trying to actually help. It's crap like this that makes me want to log onto my server, load IIS, and just hit the shutdown button. I'll probably regret saying this - but hey - I've always been honest here so I figure there is no need to stop now. But I'm just really, really surprised.
