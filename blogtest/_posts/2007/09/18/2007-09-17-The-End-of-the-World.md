So I was testing Yahoo for a friend of mine who said he couldn't hit their server. This is the news story that was on top:

<blockquote>
<a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20070918/sc_afp/peruhealthoffbeat">Mystery  meteorite illness</a><br/>
Villagers in Peru are struck by a mysterious illness after a meteorite crashes nearby.
</blockquote>

Am I the only one who thinks this sounds like the beginning of a bad sci-fi show?
