Just a few quick links I wanted to share. First off - Jason Delmore of Adobe <a href="http://www.cfinsider.com/index.cfm/2007/9/20/Amazing-Features-of-CF8-Presentation">blogged</a> about a presentation he did. The blog entry contains the download for a <i>very</i> nice 'what is CF' presentation. He also links to Adobe's <a href="http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/event/index.cfm?event=detail&id=506273&loc=en_us">ColdFusion eSeminar Series</a>. There are three upcoming presentations that folks may like to see: 

Creating Rich Internet Applications with Flex and ColdFusion<br>
The ColdFusion 8 Server Monitor<br>
Beyond HTML: using Ajax, PDF, and more to create engaging applications with ColdFusion 8<br>

Next - by way of a <a href="http://teratech.com/blog/index.cfm/2007/9/20/ColdFusion-8-CFDocument-Cumulative-Hot-Fix">Teratech post</a>, there is another hot fix released for ColdFusion 8, this one related to CFDocument.
