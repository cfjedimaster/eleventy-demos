For the past two weeks or so - Firefox 2.0.0.7 on both my OS X machines has been horrible. Multiple crashes, all day long. I'm tempted to switch to Safari, but would be lost without Firebug (oh, and <a href="http://coldfire.riaforge.org">ColdFire</a>). Has anyone else noticed a rise in flakiness lately in Firefox?
