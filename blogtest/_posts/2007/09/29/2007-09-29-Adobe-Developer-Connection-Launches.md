I'm a bit late reporting this, but it looks like the new <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/">Adobe Developer Connection</a> site has launched. I have to say - I'm not quite sure what I think about the UI. But it is definitely new and unique - I'll give it lots of credit for that.

It also looks like you can <a href="https://www.adobe.com/cfusion/entitlement/index.cfm?e=adc">sign up</a> for the site. Benefits include:

    * Newsletters – Adobe Edge and Developer Connection Update
      Get the latest news on projects and techniques delivered right to your inbox.
    * Developer Desktop – An AIR application for Flex developers
      Stay on top of updates to the Flex bug base through automatic desktop notifications.
    * O'Reilly book discount
      Buy two O'Reilly Books, and get a third free, plus free shipping. For a limited time only.

The O'Reilly one seems especially good - and I'm definitely going to download the Developer Desktop.
