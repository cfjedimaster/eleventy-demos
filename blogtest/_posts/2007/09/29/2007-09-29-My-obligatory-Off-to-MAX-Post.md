I'm sitting in Lafayette Regional waiting to board my flight to Memphis on the way to Chicago. If you are a reader of the blog and are attending MAX, be sure to say hi to the tall goofy looking guy (wait, this is a tech conference, that may not be specific enough). 

I assume everyone remembers the "rules" - while I am gone you are not to find any bugs in my software. Everything works perfectly. These are not the droids you are looking for. Etc.

I'll be blogging as much as possible from MAX, but if you have any specific questions, let me know!
