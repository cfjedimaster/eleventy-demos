I just blogged about <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/spry/">Spry 1.6</a>, but today there are some <b>very</b> important updates on Labs:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/air/">Adobe <strike>Apollo</strike>AIR beta 2</a> - This is the #1 technology I really wish I had more time to play with. Now that the books are done I'm hoping to get to blog a bit more aboit it.
<li><a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/flex/">Flex 3 Beta 2</a> - Another very important release. Flex just seems to get better and better. 
<li><a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/mediaplayer/">Adobe Media Player</a> - this one is a bit unusual. I need to play with a bit more before I really comment on it. Anyone here play with it more and have an opinion?
<li><a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/share/">Share</a> - For this one I'll rip the description from the site: "Welcome to a preview of Adobe's latest online offering codenamed 'Share', a free web-based service that allows you to easily share, publish and organize your documents."
</ul>
