Today <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/spry/">Spry 1.6</a> was released. Along with the new build is a new <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/spry/home.html">website/portal</a>   which contains links to demos, docs and more. Also, the Spry Team has an updated blog entry on the 1.6 release:

<a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/spryteam/">Spry 1.6 and the Dreamweaver Updater</a>

One of my favorite bits from the entry:

<blockquote>
We have included packed and minimized javascript files for everything. This gets all of us some significant file size savings, for example: SpryData.js: 128kb to 41Kb. SpryEffects.js: 77 to 29.
</blockquote>

I'll try to do some demos of Spry 1.6 later on during the week, but definitely check it out now!<p><a href='enclosures/D{% raw %}%3A%{% endraw %}5Chosts{% raw %}%5Cwww%{% endraw %}2Ecoldfusionjedi{% raw %}%2Ecom%{% endraw %}5Cenclosures{% raw %}%2Fspry%{% endraw %}5Ffma%2Ejpg'>Download attached file.</a></p>
