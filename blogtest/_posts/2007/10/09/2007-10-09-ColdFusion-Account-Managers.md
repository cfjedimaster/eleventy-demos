I'm stealing some blog content from Ben Forta's <a href="http://www.forta.com/blog/index.cfm/2007/10/9/ColdFusions-Dedicated-Account-Managers">blog</a> to help spread the word about the resources Adobe has put behind ColdFusion. Quote:

Just a reminder (especially for those of you whose experiences when calling Adobe sales regarding ColdFusion were anything less than stellar) ...

Adobe has dedicated ColdFusion Account Managers (in the U.S. and Canada), all they do is ColdFusion, and they can help with purchasing, EULA and pricing questions, and more. Here are the contact details:
