David asks:

<blockquote>
Are there any ColdFusion Code Beautifiers or Formatters you are aware of on RIAForge or within the community?
</blockquote>

Now personally I think <i>all</i> ColdFusion code is beautiful, but outside of that - I am unaware of any such tool. I know the old HomeSite+/ColdFusion Studio had code formatters, although I don't remember if there was a ColdFusion one.

Anyone know?
