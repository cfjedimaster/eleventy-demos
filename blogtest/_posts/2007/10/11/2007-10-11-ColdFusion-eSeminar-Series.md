I don't think I blogged on this before, but Adobe is running a series of <a href="http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/event/index.cfm?event=detail&id=506273">ColdFusion eSeminars</a> that might be of interest to you. One is going on right now - but there are more in the future:

<blockquote>
Amazing new features in ColdFusion 8<br>
Thursday, October 18, 2007<br>
10:00 AM - 11:00 AM US/Pacific<br>

Creating Rich Internet Applications with Flex and ColdFusion  <br>
Thursday, November 1, 2007<br>
10:00 AM - 11:00 AM US/Pacific<br>

The ColdFusion 8 Server Monitor<br>
Thursday, November 8, 2007<br>
10:00 AM - 11:00 AM US/Pacific<br>

Beyond HTML: using Ajax, PDF, and more to create engaging applications with ColdFusion 8<br>
Thursday, November 15, 2007<br>
10:00 AM - 11:00 AM US/Pacific
</blockquote>

Now that last one sounds interesting - especially if it isn't half an hour on PDF and half an hour on Ajax, but a combination of the two together. I <i>did</i> create a PDF editor a while ago during the ColdFusion 8 beta. I need to release that puppy and let people play with it.
