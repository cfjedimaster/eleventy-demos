I just released <a href="http://blogcfc.riaforge.org">BlogCFC 5.9</a> up to RIAForge. This is mainly a "maintenance" release where I tried to cover as many bugs as possible. It does include a few new features. 

<ul>
<li>Pinging will use CFTHREAD in ColdFusion 8, making the saving of a new blog entry much quicker.
<li>Added a contact form. I believe Charlie Arehart blogged on this - but I know it is <i>really</i> frustrating to hit a blog and have no idea how to contact a user. Now all BlogCFC installs will have a simple contact form built in.
</ul>

The <a href="http://blogcfc.riaforge.org/index.cfm?event=page.svnview&path={% raw %}%2Finstall&file=readme%{% endraw %}2Etxt">readme.txt</a> file describes all the changes.

Now lets have a moment of silence. This is the last release of the BlogCFC 5.X code base. The end of the <i>entire</i> code base. BlogCFC 6 development officially begins next week. (Although I've been playing with some code already.) I plan to do this build much different than earlier versions. 

First off - there will be a whole new SVN line. This way I can push any bug fixes to BlogCFC 5.9 and keep BlogCFC 6 in it's own sandbox. Secondly - I'm going to be bringing more people into the process. In the past I've been accused (fairly) of being a bit... tight with my code. I want to make V6 more open. I'll probably even be giving a few people write access. (Breathe deeply, Ray.) I've got some big plans and I'll definitely need help.
