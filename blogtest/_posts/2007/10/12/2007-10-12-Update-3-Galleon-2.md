It's done. Galleon 2 - a major update of my forums package, is now released. You can download it from RIAForge: <a href="http://galleon.riaforge.org">http://galleon.riaforge.org</a>

This version includes the following new features:

<ul>
<li>New logo by Murat Kgirgin.
<li>Totally new Admin design and a CSS-ified version of the front end. This will make replacing the front end easier (and a new theme is in the works). Credit goes to <a href="http://www.chazjachimski.com">Chaz Jachimski</a> and Emmet McGovern at <a href="http://www.fullcitymedia.com">full city media</a>. They donated the design and thanks go to them. (Especially for all the times I asked Emmet if he was done yet.)
<li>Avatars. You can now upload an image for an avatar, or use your gravatar.
<li>You can now edit your settings in the Admin.
<li>BBML thanks to Depressed Press
<li>New security system. You can now make truly private conferences. 
</ul>

There is a minor bug in the admin involving the filter option for theme/message lists. Bug as in you can't use it. Also - the Access database hasn't been updated to the new table schema, but hey, who uses Access anyway?

I hope to have my own <a href="http://www.coldfusionjedi.com/forums">forums</a> updated next week.
