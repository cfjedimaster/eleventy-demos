If you are a blogger aggregated at <a href="http://www.coldfusionbloggers.org">ColdFusionBloggers.org</a>, please note that I've added a ping service. This will get your content aggregated quicker. You can read up on it at the <a href="http://www.cfbloggers.org/faq.cfm#q3a">FAQ</a>. I've also finally gotten around to getting the domain alias working for <a href="http://www.cfbloggers.org">CFBloggers.org</a> - in case you don't feel like typing as much. The code download has <i>not</i> been updated. Once I wrap up my new 'process' code, I'll update it.
