I wrote a handy little tool today. Drop the zip into your ColdFusion Administrator folder, edit the custommenu.xml file to point to it, and you've now got a simple tool to let you run test searches against Verity collections. Here is a screen shot:

When matches are found, I use pagination, but the actual data is just dumped out. I could have done this all sexy and Ajaxy, but I figured a one file solution that also worked in ColdFusion 7 would be nice as well.

You can download the code below. I have another extension coming out later this week. This will join my <a href="http://spoolmail.riaforge.org">SpoolMail</a> project and Scott's <a href="http://flogr.riaforge.org">Flogr</a> as must-have add ons to your ColdFusion Admin. (Well, I think they are must-haves, but I'm biased. :)

p.s. Anyone know how I can map a Windows drive to my Mac?<p><a href='enclosures/D{% raw %}%3A%{% endraw %}5Chosts{% raw %}%5Cwww%{% endraw %}2Ecoldfusionjedi{% raw %}%2Ecom%{% endraw %}5Cenclosures{% raw %}%2Findex%{% endraw %}2Ecfm%2Ezip'>Download attached file.</a></p>
