I've updated the look and feel to my blog again. The design is called "refresh" and comes from <a href="http://www.styleshout.com">StyyleShout.com</a>, the same guys who provided the design for <a href="http://www.coldfusionbloggers.org">ColdFusionBloggers.org</a>. Check out their site as they have some wicked cool (sorry - trying to sound young) free designs. 

FYI, I'm aware that my site is a bit borked in IE7 and Safari. The Refresh template works in IE7 on their site, so I'm sure I just made a small mistake somewhere. I'll try to fix that today.
