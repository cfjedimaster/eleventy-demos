Via Ed Tabara, it looks like the downloads of BlogCFC <a href="http://www.1smartsolution.com/blog/index.cfm/2007/10/30/BlogCFC--10000-downloads">crossed 10,000</a>. Wow! Not that it really <i>matters</i> of course. This puts BlogCFC in second place at <a href="http://www.riaforge.org">RIAForge</a>. <a href="http://flexible.riaforge.org">FLEXible</a> has me beat by close to 500 downloads. (Ok, time to execute the 'massageMyStats' hack!)
