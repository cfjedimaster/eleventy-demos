November is national adoption month, which also includes the <a href="http://www.nationaladoptionday.org/2007/index.asp">National Adoption Day</a> on the 17th. My wife and I adopted three beautiful kids from South Korea and consider it to be the best decisions in our life. If you have ever considered adoption then this is a perfect time to start looking into it more. It is a long, and sometimes <i>very</i> difficult process, but hey, so is life too. Check out About.com's <a href="http://adoption.about.com/od/adopting/a/30daycalendar.htm">list of ideas</a> on how to celebrate the month. 

And hey - you get your fingerprints sent to INTERPOL - how cool is that???
