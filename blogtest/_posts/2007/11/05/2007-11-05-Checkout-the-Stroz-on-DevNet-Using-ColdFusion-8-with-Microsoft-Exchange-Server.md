Scott Stroz has just released an article on DevNet: <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/coldfusion/articles/cfexchange.html">Using ColdFusion 8 with Microsoft Exchange Server</a>. As you can probably guess - it covers Exchange integration with ColdFusion, an area I have yet to really dig into so I'm very happy to see articles like this out there. Scott is a kick butt ColdFusion and Flex guy so he is definitely worth your time reading!
