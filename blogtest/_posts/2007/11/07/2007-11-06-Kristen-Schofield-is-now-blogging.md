And in case you don't know who that is, <a href="http://www.webbschofield.com/">Kristen</a> is the new ColdFusion Product Marketing Manager, taking over the position Tim had. Kristen is not "new" to CF though - she has been around since the Allaire days - which is as about as "old with CF" as you can get.
