I've seen a few others note this so I thought I'd pass the word on as well - Adobe has released an updater to <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/jrun/">JRun</a>. Updater 7 was released on the 6th and may be downloaded <a href="http://www.adobe.com/support/jrun/updaters.html">here</a>. Release notes (in PDF format) may be found <a href="http://www.adobe.com/support/documentation/en/jrun/4/updater7/releasenotes_4_updater7.pdf">here</a>.
