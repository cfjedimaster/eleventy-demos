Today I'm giving two presentations. These are not new presentations, but if you missed them before it is an excellent chance to watch them live.

The first presentation is at 3PM Central for the ColdFusion Online Meetup. I'll be presenting on <a href="http://coldfusion.meetup.com/17/calendar/6679975/">ColdFusion 8's Ajax features</a>. Please RSVP if you can attend. 

The second meeting will be for the Columbus CFUG at 5PM Central. I'll be presenting on Spry and ColdFusion. The Connect URL is <a href="http://adobechats.adobe.acrobat.com/r93349406/">http://adobechats.adobe.acrobat.com/r93349406/</a>.
