BA Hellman wrote me last night to mention his web site, <a href="http://answers.nobosh.com/">noboshanswers</a>, is being featured at Apple: <a href="http://www.apple.com/webapps/">Apple - Web apps - All Categories</a>. Specifically they are featuring his <a href="http://www.apple.com/webapps/productivity/noboshanswers.html">iPhone version</a> of the site. BA - find a way to make them mention "ColdFusion" in the review! (Oh, and if anyone would like me to review their iPhone enabled site, please send me an iPhone. I'd be happy to. Seriously.)
