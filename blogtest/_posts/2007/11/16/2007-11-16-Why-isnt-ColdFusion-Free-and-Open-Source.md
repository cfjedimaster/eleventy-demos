So the post is a bit old (one week), but I wanted to point out a very interesting article by ColdFusion Product Jason Delmore:

<a href="http://www.cfinsider.com/index.cfm/2007/11/10/Things-ColdFusion-is-not-and-Why-ColdFusion-isnt-free">Things ColdFusion is not... and... Why ColdFusion isn't free...</a>

Jason talks about the reasons why you can't get ColdFusion for free, and why it isn't OS. Please post any comments to his entry of course.
