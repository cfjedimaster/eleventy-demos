Attached to this blog entry is a modified version of <a href="http://lighthousepro.riaforge.org">Lighthouse Pro</a> that works for Sybase. This modification was written by Tri Nguyen so all credit goes to ... um... him or her. Not sure. :) As the title says, this is an unofficial modification. I don't want to post his/her email address, but if you have any support requests, post a comment her. I will let Tri know to monitor the entry.<p><a href='enclosures/D{% raw %}%3A%{% endraw %}5Chosts{% raw %}%5Cwww%{% endraw %}2Ecoldfusionjedi{% raw %}%2Ecom%{% endraw %}5Cenclosures{% raw %}%2Flighthousepro%{% endraw %}2Dsybase%2Ezip'>Download attached file.</a></p>
