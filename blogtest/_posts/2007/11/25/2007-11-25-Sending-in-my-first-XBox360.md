Well, looks like I'll be sending in my XBox 360 this week. A few weeks ago the back USB port died. No big deal. I can live with my wireless network hanging off the front of the box. But before that - and for a few months - my disc tray has been a bit... sticky. Tonight it finally died. I click the button to open the drive and it just makes a 'whirring' noise before giving up. I do know how to manually open it, but that won't do for day to day game play. I don't mind spending the 99 bucks to get it repaired - but now I have to figure out what to do about my saves. I have a <i>lot</i> of saved games on this thing, and I'm willing to bet Microsoft won't guarantee my hard drive will remain the same. Should I just pick up one of those memory cards?
