For some time now the download link at the <a href="http://www.coldfusioncookbook.com">ColdFusion Cookbook</a> has been down. I've been working with Adobe on a cfdocument bug that is now finally squashed. Now if you download the guide, which has <b>129</b> entries, you will find that I've added a table of contents as well as bookmarks. This will make the PDF <i>much</i> easier to work with. It still isn't quite as pretty as I would like, but it's readable.

I'd also like to encourage folks to check out the Cookbook. The site never really got the traffic I thought it deserved, but then again, I'm a bit biased. ;) I'm hoping to give the site a bit of attention this month, including getting the documentation links pointing to ColdFusion 8 help files, not ColdFusion 7.
