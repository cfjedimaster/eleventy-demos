Forgive the 'business' post on my mostly technical blog, but I thought I'd let folks know about the merger of Jeff Tapper and Mike Nimer's company (hopefully folks recognize those names!) and Digital Primates. I've worked for Tapper and Nimer for some time now, and can attest both to their skills technically and their business practices. They are easily one of the best groups I've had the pleasure of working with so far as a contractor. I've only recently worked with the Primates (hope they don't mind me calling them that, but with a name like theirs, they have to be used to it ;), but they are a darn good group from what I've seen (and have been supportive of my open source work). More information at the <a href="http://www.digitalprimates.com/index.html">Digital Primates</a> site.
