Todd Sharp is once again running his CFeMmy Awards which - to quote him, "recognize the outstanding contributors, products and websites in the ColdFusion Community." He is currently looking for <a href="http://cfsilence.com/blog/client/index.cfm/2007/12/12/2007-CFeMmy-Awards--Nominations-Open">nominations</a> and has a list of already nominated resources.
