My Mac friends - who I thought were super-intelligent, have failed me yet again (you know who you are - squads of Storm Troopers are on the way). Can anyone recommend a good CD ripper? I need something that will hit up CDDB and generate nicely named tracks. Much like CDEX does for Windows. (In case folks are curious as to what I need to rip, check out the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000507CM/ref=wl_it_dp?ie=UTF8&coliid=I1MUWF4AM3GV4Z&colid=2TCL1D08EZEYE">Amazon link</a>. It's currently causing ear damage right now. ;)
