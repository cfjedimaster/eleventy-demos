Since I consider Out of Office email auto responders to be the spawn of the devil (I've gotten maybe 100 this holiday season and frankly I despise them - if you can't at least configure them to respond to a unique email once, then you are no better than most spammers), I thought I'd drop a quick note to let folks know I'll be off this week. As always, the 'rule' is to not find any major bugs in my software while I'm on vacation. ;)

If you send email, most likely I will not respond until later this week, so please keep that in mind. 

And to my readers - may your Christmas be at least 1000 times better than this horrible final Saints game I'm watching.
