Just a quick note to tell folks Merry Christmas. We just got done eating and my kids are now learning to use their new computer (the 20 inch iMac with some good educational/typing games). My wife picked me up a beautiful Swiss Army watch (the brown Chrono Classic) to add to my collection and I'm contently letting the pumpkin pie settle in. I'll be back in the office Thursday. (And back on the diet. ;)

p.s. I find it incredibly ridiculous that Cox is broadcasting an HD channel showing nothing but a fireplace. I find it even more ridiculous that I have it on.
