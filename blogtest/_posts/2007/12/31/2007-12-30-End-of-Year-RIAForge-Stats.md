RIAForge, which <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2006/10/18/Announcing-RIAForge">launched</a> a bit over a year ago, has had a pretty good year. The stats at years end are:

Total Active Projects: 383<br />
Total Views: 2,778,627<br />
Total Downloads: 170,953<br />
Total Verified Users: 2,731<br />

I know folks are still waiting for multi-user SVN and project administration. I'm still hoping to get this "real soon now", but as this is in my spare time now, it's been delayed. 

I'm also curious to know - has anyone implemented the RIAForge source? Care to share how?
