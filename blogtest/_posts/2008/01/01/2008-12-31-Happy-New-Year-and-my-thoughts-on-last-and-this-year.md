First off - Happy New Year to everyone. For the first time in a long time, my wife and I actually made it all the way to midnight. Barely. But we made it. Of course today I feel like a truck ran over me.

I thought I'd talk a bit about the previous year and what it meant to me. I can't imagine this being interesting to anyone else but me, so I won't be offended if folks ignore the rest. ;)

The biggest change for me this year was launching my own business, Camden Media. For the first time in my career I had total control over my work, and frankly, it was awesome. I've gotten to do quite a bit of interesting work, including some darn challenging work as well. I've also been lucky to have some really good clients, some who even pushed me to blog what I was doing for them so I could share it with the community.

I was able to do some Flex, Spry, and even a tiny bit of AIR work, but not nearly as much as I would like. (So consider that a shout out to anyone who has additional Flex/AIR work.)

Luckily I didn't hurt for work either. I expected to have dry spells, but I really didn't have much at all. Better too much work then not enough. 

The only real drawback of having your own business is the paperwork. My wife handled most of that, and now I'm using a friend of mine (and paying him of course), so that's better. Still though, I think I might change things up this year. More on that later.

In technology, the big news obviously was ColdFusion 8. I've blogged about a billion times on that so I won't say much more than that. Personally I tried to spend more time with Ajax and Flex. I spent most of my time with Spry, which really matured over the past year, but I promised myself I'd make time to learn JQuery and Ext in 2008. 

This is also the year I'm going to stop being lazy and embrace unit testing. As I work more on BlogCFC 6, I'm going to make unit testing part of my development process. 

On the hardware side, I have fully embraced Macs. I got my first Mac in 06, but in 07 I updated my desktop to a Mac and got my wife and kids a Mac as well. The Mac is certainly <b>not</b> perfect, but boy am I happy to be (mostly) away from Windows. 

So that's all for now. I need to relax/recover a bit before heading out to be with family. Once again - happy new year!
