If you've read my blog at all you know I've been really getting into Flex 3 and AIR. I encourage any "pure CF" developer to take a look at these technologies as they really, really, make front end development a heck of a lot cooler. Both products are getting close to final release, and in preparation, Adobe's Platform Evangelist team is traveling around the country giving demos and - of course - giving away some cool schwag. For a list of locations and dates, see <a href="http://flex.org/tour/">http://flex.org/tour/</a>. Looks like nothing in Louisiana though, which is too bad since it's Mardi Grad season!

Any of my readers going?
