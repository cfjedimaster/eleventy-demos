About a year or so ago, I made a deal with DevWebPro.com. I allowed them to aggregate blog entries of interest from my site. In theory, I'd get some return traffic from them. Back a few months ago I wrote them to ask them to stop aggregating my blog entries. I didn't hear back. A few days ago I saw yet another of my articles on their site (<a href="http://www.devwebpro.com/devwebpro-39-20080104ColdfusionFlexibleStringComparisons.html">Coldfusion: Flexible String Comparisons</a>). I wrote them again that day - no response. I wrote them again this morning and still haven't heard back.

So - hey guys. Um - obviously you read the blog and you decide which articles to bring in. Maybe you can a) stop it, and b) fire the people who are supposed to be handling the emails that apparently ended up in the round file.
