Two quick updates this morning. I've released a minor update to <a href="http://blogcfc.riaforge.org">BlogCFC</a>. This update fixes another date issue (curse the world for daring to treat dates differently!) and adds some more xmlFormatting-love to the RSS output. I have <b>not</b> forgotten about BlogCFC V6 (aka Golden Snitch). With the holidays it has taken a back seat to other concerns, and frankly, I'd rather go slow then badly. I'm hoping to push another update out this month.

Next, <a href="http://coldfire.riaforge.org">ColdFire</a> has been updated with a few minor bug fixes. This was all done by Nathan Mische, so all thanks go to him!
