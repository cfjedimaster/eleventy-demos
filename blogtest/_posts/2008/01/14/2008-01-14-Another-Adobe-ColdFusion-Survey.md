Just a quick note to make sure folks read Damon Cooper's latest blog entry:

<a href="http://www.dcooper.org/blog/client/index.cfm?mode=entry&entry=79B3DF0C-4E22-1671-59F78A8081FA7A91">Adobe ColdFusion...What Next?</a>

If you care about the future of ColdFusion, be sure to visit his blog and follow the links to the two surveys. It won't take you more than 15-20 minutes total to fill them out. Be sure to ask for more cowbell. ColdFusion needs more cowbell darnit.
