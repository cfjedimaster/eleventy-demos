A few minutes ago I got an interesting question from a reader. However - the question has <i>very</i> different meanings depending on what the intent was. 

Unfortunately - the user signed his email with no name and a fake email address.

So if you are that user, can you please write back? And I'm also curious why folks would want to post questions anonymously. I do typically name the person who asks the question, but I don't use last names. 

Personally - I tend to get ticked off when folks post anonymously (I don't mean to my contact form, I mean around the web in general). Unless you are living in a dictatorship and are fearful for your life, you should stand behind your words. I tend to simply ignore anonymous posts/comments as they generally aren't worth much.
