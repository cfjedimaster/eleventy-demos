Thank you to everyone who continues to check in. More than one person has had a bad week, or has had setbacks, but I'm happy to see so many people still sticking to it. (From the original bunch, we still have a bit over 20 left.) Here are the stats:

Week 3 weight total: 5,930<br>
Week 3 weight average: 247.08<br>
Week 3 lowest: 181<br>
Week 3 highest: 390<br>
Biggest Loser (Pounds): Chad Gray (8 lbs)<br>
Biggest Loser ({% raw %}%): Chad Gray ( 3.86 %{% endraw %})<br>
Total Weight Lost: 49.5<br>

Congrats to Chad. Once again I had a bad week myself - just losing one pound. But we adjusted the scale after a doctor's visit 5 pounds lower. So I adjusted all 3 weeks for me. I'm now at 227, which is awesome. My biggest issue now is exercise. My pushups kill me - but don't seem to be very effective anymore. My situps as well. I'm increasing everything, but it doesn't seem to be working yet. I guess that means they are actually working, but at the same time, I feel like I'm at the limit of my strength. So it's like I can't go more - and I can't get any benefit. Ugh.
