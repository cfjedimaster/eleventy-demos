Dan Wilson has <a href="http://www.nodans.com/index.cfm/2008/1/29/How-to-grow-the-ColdFusion-community-What-YOU-can-do-to-help">announced</a> the launch of a ColdFusion Zone over at DZone. DZone is one of my favorite web sites. It doesn't usually carry ColdFusion content, but it is a darn good tech aggregator for web developers. And frankly - I enjoy looking at how other languages solve problems as well. (It just makes me appreciate ColdFusion more.) With the launch of this new zone though, the amount of ColdFusion content we see at DZone may increase! Check it out:
