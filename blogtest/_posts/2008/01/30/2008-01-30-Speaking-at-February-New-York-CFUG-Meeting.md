Looks like I'll be up in the Big Apple next month. I'll be presenting at the <a href="http://www.nycfug.com/">New York ColdFusion User Group</a> on February 12th at 6:30 PM. I'm talking about my favorite topic, CFFEED and RSS parsing in ColdFusion. I'll bring a long a WACK or two (if it can fit in my carry on) and I hope to see you there! The question is - will I be able to <i>escape</i> from New York when I'm done? Luckily I have role models to look up to...
