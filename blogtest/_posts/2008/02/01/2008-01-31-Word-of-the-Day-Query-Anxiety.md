Word: Query Anxiety

Definition: The feeling you get in your gut when you are running a query and also dumping it and you realize you screwed up the SQL and your about to get about 10000 records displayed on screen. 

Not that I've ever done that. Really. Pardon me while I shut down/restart Firefox and get back a few gigs of RAM.
