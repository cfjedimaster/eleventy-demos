Congrats to Joel for the big loss! My own stats are so so. On Monday I was down to 222, which is awesome, but when I checked yesterday I was back up to 225. But as long as I can get back to 222 for Monday, I'll be happy. I'm now wearing size 36 jeans. Considering I was pushing the edge of 38 for a while, it is a very nice feeling. Best of all - they actually fit.
