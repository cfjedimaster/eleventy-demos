I'm a bit late on this (Ben <a href="http://www.bennadel.com/index.cfm?dax=blog:1147.view">posted it</a> yesterday), but RIAForge is now hosting <a href="http://imageutils.riaforge.org/">ImageUtils.cfc</a>. Like my <a href="http://pdfutils.riaforge.org/">PDFUtils</a> CFC, the idea is simple. Take the already great support of images in CF8 and add some simple helper functions. Anyone is welcome to make suggestions for items to add (note, the bug tracker isn't enabled yet, I'll bug Ben) to the component. Also check out the <a href="http://www.bennadel.com/resources/demo/imageutils/index.cfm">demo</a> page for examples of what's built in so far. (Please note that the model shown in the demo is not included with the CFC. Good luck with that.)
