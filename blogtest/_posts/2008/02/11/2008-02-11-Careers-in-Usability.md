<img src="https://static.raymondcamden.com/images/cfjedi/coffeetalk.jpg" style="margin-right: 10px" align="left">A friend recently came to me and mentioned his wife was interested in picking up some work at home. She isn't a programmer, but is interested in doing work in usability. I've little experience with this myself, outside of some exposure I've gotten over the years working on web sites.

So the question for my readers is - what would be a recommended way for someone to get into the field? Does it even make sense as a 'at home' type job? Any ORA books on the topic? Any and all advice would be appreciated. (As the coffee lady would say - "Talk amongst yourselves!")
