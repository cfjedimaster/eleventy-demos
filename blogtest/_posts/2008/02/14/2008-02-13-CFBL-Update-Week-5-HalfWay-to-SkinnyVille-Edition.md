Ok, so maybe "SkinnyVille" isn't exactly where I (or those of us in the club) will be, but it's something to shoot for! Week 5 is halfway through. I'm down to about 17-18 people, and those of you who have not submitted, shame on you! ;) 

In this report I've included a total weight loss so far. If people don't want their name listed, let me know. This list includes folks who haven't sent in recent reports as well, so please consider this your friendly reminder. ;) Only people who send reports for all 10 weeks are eligible for the prize.
