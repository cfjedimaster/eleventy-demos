Right now I'm watching a story on the Today show about a mother who launched a business to help save money on the cost of toys. The idea is that instead of buying toys your child will only play with for a few months, you will rent them instead, like movie rentals. The toys - when returned, are cleaned/sanitized to keep them safe. 

I happen to know a little bit about the site. Up until a few days ago, it was written in PHP. They were worried about how well it would stand up under load and switched to ColdFusion. (Whooyah!)  FYI, <a href="http://cfsilence.com/blog/client/index.cfm">Todd Sharp</a> did some work for my company to help get these guys converted.
