Just found out my latest article has been published up on the Adobe Developer Center:

<a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/coldfusion/articles/ajax_security.html?devcon=f3">Using ColdFusion 8 Ajax security features</a>

It is mainly a rehash of things I've said it before, but I think it's a nice summary of the features. Let me know what you think.
