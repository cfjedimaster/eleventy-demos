And with the final release of AIR, cue the puns. Ok, seriously, I must have some kind of mental block with Adobe's web site. Where does one download documentation for AIR? I did find the online docs, but I had to use the site search tool to find it. I've yet to find a <i>direct path</i> to them.

<a href="http://livedocs.adobe.com/air/1/devappshtml/">Developing AIR Applications with HTML and Ajax</a><br/>
<a href="http://livedocs.adobe.com/flex/3/html/help.html?content=Part5_AIR_1.html">Developing AIR Applications with Flex</a><br>
<a href="http://livedocs.adobe.com/air/1/devappsflash/">Developing AIR Applications with Flash</a>

I haven't yet found the PDF downloadable version. Can someone share? I'll also use the Adobe web contact because I can't believe I'm the only one wondering the documentation link is.
