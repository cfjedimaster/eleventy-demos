Ok honestly, that "edition" really makes no sense. Anyway, here is the report from week 7. I had a <i>great</i> week - 5 pounds lost. Pretty surprising since I was sick for the last half of the week and didn't do as much exercise. 

Week 7 weight total: 4,470
Week 7 weight average: 235.26
Week 7 lowest: 179
Week 7 highest: 385
People this week: 17
Biggest Loser (Pounds): Scot Stroz (6 lbs)
Biggest Loser ({% raw %}%): Raymond Camden ( 2.27 %{% endraw %})
Total Weight Lost: 19

Heh, I didn't even notice my name there till just now. Well congrats to Scott and I. :)
