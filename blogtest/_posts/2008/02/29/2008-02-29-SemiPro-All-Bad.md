Ugh. I'll keep it short and sweet. You would be better off seeing Brittany Spears recite Shakespeare than see Semi-Pro. It was so bad - I kid you not - my wife and I turned to each other and we walked out 40 minutes in. I've <i>never</i> walked out of a film, but this was just so amazingly bad we figured we had no other choice. Semi-Pro has now surpassed Highlander 2 as my worst cinema experience.
