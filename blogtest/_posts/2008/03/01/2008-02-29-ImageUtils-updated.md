Just a quick note to let you know about an update to <a href="http://imageutils.riaforge.org/">imageUtils</a>. The new function is AspectCrop, and you can see a demo <a href="http://www.bennadel.com/resources/demo/imageutils/demos/aspectcrop.cfm">here</a>. This function mashes both a resize and a crop to create a result a bit nicer then just a plain resize or crop. See the demo for examples. This function was submitted by <a href="http://www.illequipped.com/blog">Emmet McGovern</a>.
