I'm a bit late in reporting this (credit goes to <a href="http://www.cfinsider.com/index.cfm/2008/3/6/ColdFusion-wins-Product-Excellence-Award-in-Web-Development">Jason</a> for being the first), but ColdFusion has won a <a href="http://www.drdobbs.com/blog/portal/archives/2008/03/jolt_award_winn.html">Jolt Award</a> from Dr. Dobb's Journal. It won in the Web Development category.

Yeah... ColdFusion is <i>so</i> dead. Somebody must have forgot to tell DDJ.
