I'm the track chair for the advanced track at CFUNITED. We are looking to fill another session and thought it would be fun to open it to the public. If you have an idea for a session, suggest the topic along with a speaker. I'll take the best 5 topics (best being relative of course) and create a survey for folks to vote. If your session is chosen, you get a free ticket to the conference. Note that in order for your session to eligible, you have to suggest a speaker who is also willing to do the presentation, and will be at CFUNITED.
