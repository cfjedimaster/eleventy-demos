My buddy Scott sent me this link: <a href="http://home.austarnet.com.au/petersykes/topscifi/lists_books_rank1.html">Sci-Fi Lists - Top 100 Sci-Fi Books</a>. It is a pretty good list of the best books of the genre, although I'm sure people could argue about the order (and what's included or not included). As much I liked Dune, I'm not sure I'd consider it #1. 1984, for example, is a much more important book, although it tends to get all the attention for dystopian literature. For an alternative to 1984, check out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Modern-Library-Classics-Yevgeny-Zamyatin/dp/081297462X/ref=pd_bbs_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1205094823&sr=8-2">We</a>. 

My recommendations from this list, in no particular order, would be:

<ul>
<li>Ender's Game (my #1 probably)
<li>Any of the Neal Stephenson books, especially Diamond Age. I know Snow Crash is cooler (and I'll never forget the scene with the rail gun), I just felt like Diamond Age was neater.
<li>Lord of Light - which I've never read, but heard is very good. I was a huge fan of Zelazny's Amber series, which I hear is crap compared to Lord of Light.
<li>A Canticle for Leibowitz
<li>The Handmaid's Tale -feminism and sci-fi, interesting mix
<li>Flatland
<li>Neuromancer - I still like to think of security in terms of "ice"
<li>While not "high art", many of the Star Wars novels are pretty good, especially the Thrawn trilogy.
</ul>

And while not a book - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Mind_Forever_Voyaging">A Mind Forever Voyaging</a> is the single best sci-fi game ever made.
