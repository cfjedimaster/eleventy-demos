An update was released to <a href="http://coldfire.riaforge.org">ColdFire</a> yesterday, but today I've made another update I wanted to share with folks. For the first time - I'm stepping away from a project. ColdFire was created by myself and Adam Podolnick a while ago, but Nathan Mische has really taken over. He has made some <b>darn</b> good updates on the client side and has really taken the lead. I decided today it made sense to set him as the project manager. I'm still involved in the project, but it seemed silly for him to come to for approval when he was really leading the way here.

I feel really weird about it - but screw it. It's best to let smart people lead the way. :) I'm just happy to be a part of the <i>best</i> ColdFusion debugger around. (Not that I'm biased or anything.)
