Well, we are almost there folks. Here are the stats for the second to last week:

Week 9 weight total: 2,967<br>
Week 9 weight average: 228.23<br>
Week 9 lowest: 178<br>
Week 9 highest: 384<br>
People this week: 13<br>
Biggest Loser (Pounds): Adam Bielawski (5 lbs)<br>
Biggest Loser ({% raw %}%): Adam Bielawski ( 2.21 %{% endraw %})<br>
Total Weight Lost: 19<br>

I lost a grand total of one pound, but I've been at 210 (my goal weight) all week (after Monday), so I just need to make sure I don't screw it up this weekend.
