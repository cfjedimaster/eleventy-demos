<img src="https://static.raymondcamden.com/images/cfjedi/lighthouse_header.png" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;margin-bottom:10px"> I'm happy to announce the release of <a href="http://lighthousepro.riaforge.org">LighthousePro 2.4.3</a>. For those who may not know what Lighthouse is, it is an open source bug tracker. This version includes:

<ul>
<li>New logo, provided by Ron Stewart and Marco Olson. A favicon.ico is also provided. I had mentioned a redesign a few weeks back - this is not it. The only design change here is the logo.
<li>Support for storing passwords in hash format. This was done by Jeff Smallwood. Also provided by Jeff is a way to disable RSS feeds. He thought some people may be worried about the 'autologin' nature of the RSS feeds, so a simple preference was added to support turning them off.
<li>I fixed a few minor bugs in printing, and added an alpha sort to the project list.
</ul>
