I was browsing Target of all places when this book caught my eye. The Intellectual Devotional is similar to those religious books which provide a daily scripture reading. This book focuses on American history (there is an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594865132/002-8017938-1310432?ie=UTF8&tag=raymondcamden-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=1789&creativeASIN=1594865132">earlier book which is more general</a> and provides a daily reading in various areas. So one day may cover early American literature while another will cover military history. This is one of the coolest books I've ever picked up. Each reading takes less than five minutes but gives you a good understanding of the topic. I've especially liked the pages on early American writers, something I've wanted to learn more about for a while. If I were a bit indelicate I'd say it's the perfect bathroom book. (Ok, I'll say it.) Anyway, I'd definitely recommend picking it up!
