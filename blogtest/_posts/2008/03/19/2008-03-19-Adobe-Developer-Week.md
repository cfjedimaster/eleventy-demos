Wow, I just found this out myself, but it may be old news. Next week Adobe is hosting a <b>week</b> full of developer sessions you can attend via Connect. 

<a href="http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/event/index.cfm?event=detail&id=1200007&loc=en_us">Adobe Developer Week 2008</a>

Topics cover ColdFusion, AIR, Flex, Flash, and other items. If you can't sign up for a session (or be there when it happens), Adobe will be providing recordings 5 days later.

Again - wow!
