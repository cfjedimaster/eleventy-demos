I'm a bit late on this (been vegging out with the kids since I got back home) but attached this to blog entry are the files and slides I used at my BACFUG presentation last week. You can view the recording here: <a href="http://experts.acrobat.com/p24637610/">http://experts.acrobat.com/p24637610/</a>

I want to thank the BACFUG for having me, and thank Donald Booth (one of the Spry engineers) for helping me out during the presentation.<p><a href='enclosures/D{% raw %}%3A%{% endraw %}5Chosts{% raw %}%5Cwww%{% endraw %}2Ecoldfusionjedi{% raw %}%2Ecom%{% endraw %}5Cenclosures{% raw %}%2Fspry1%{% endraw %}2Ezip'>Download attached file.</a></p>
