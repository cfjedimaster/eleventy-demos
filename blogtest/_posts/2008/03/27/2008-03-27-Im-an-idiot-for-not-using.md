ColdSpring and Transfer.

That's it. Nothing meaningful here. Just a big, giant, virtual slap to my own face for avoiding these tools for so long. They are in use at my current contract and I can't believe  I avoided learning them for so long. It's like I've been using my hands to drink for all my life and just discovered the amazing invention known as "cups". Not just useful - but kinda stupid to avoid using.
