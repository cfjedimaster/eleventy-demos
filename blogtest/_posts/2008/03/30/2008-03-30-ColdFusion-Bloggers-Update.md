I've pushed an update to <a href="http://www.coldfusionbloggers.org">ColdFusionBloggers.org</a> today. This update allows you to create RSS feeds based on searches. Simply add search=X to the URL to filter the RSS feed to items that contain the keyword X. You can provide multiple keywords by using commas. So to find items that contain Camden or Paris, you can use:

<a href="http://www.coldfusionbloggers.org/rss.cfm?search=camden,paris">http://www.coldfusionbloggers.org/rss.cfm?search=camden,paris</a>.

This also applies to the front end search as well. Thanks goes to Jacob Munson for the idea. You can still register for email alerts, but this new feature provides an alternative.
