I've got a Google Alert set up for my name for purely ego purposes. Normally it just finds my own blog posts. Today though it found something odd:

<a href="http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/exchange/index.cfm?event=authorExtensions&authorid=33584601">Adobe - Uploads by Raymond Camden</a>

This is a listing of all the stuff I uploaded to Dev Exchange. I used to use that site quite heavily back in the Allaire days, but when it they added a Flash front end to it (and it slowed down tremendously) I stopped using it - both as a submitter and a browser.

It's funny though to see all the old tags I did, especially all the Spectra ones. Some of my favorite oldies:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/exchange/index.cfm?event=extensionDetail&loc=en_us&extid=1000607">cf_style</a> - The idea here was that you could wrap text with this custom tag, and it would spit out CSS for browsers that supported it or font tags for older browsers.
<li><a href="http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/exchange/index.cfm?event=extensionDetail&loc=en_us&extid=1001131">cf_perl</a> - Let's you wrap Perl code in ColdFUsion and have it executed. The output was displayed on screen. Why did I build this? Because.
<li><a href="http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/exchange/index.cfm?event=extensionDetail&extid=1000608">cf_translate</a> - Oddly this was <b>not</b> on the list. It let you wrap text like so: <cf_translate from="English" to="French">Hi, I like Paris Hilton</cf_translate>. The output would be the translated version of the text inside the custom tag. It used the Babelfish service. If this actually still worked I'd be be shocked.
</ul>
