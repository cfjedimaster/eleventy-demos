I don't know why I never did this - but today I tweaked the "My Projects" view at RIAForge to be more generic. You can now share your project list with others, and view projects by users as well. For example, here is Rob Gonda's <a href="http://ajaxcfc.riaforge.org/index.cfm?event=page.myprojects&id=22">list</a> and here is my <a href="http://www.riaforge.org/index.cfm?event=page.myprojects&id=15">list</a>. Each project now will have a link to all the projects for an author.
