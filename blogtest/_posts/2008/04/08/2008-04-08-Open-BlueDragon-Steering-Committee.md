Just a quick note - Alan Williamson has <a href="http://alan.blog-city.com/bluedragon_steering_committee.htm">blogged</a> about the steering committee that will be helping manage the open source BlueDragon product. The more I hear about this the more interested I get. There are some darn good people on this list!
