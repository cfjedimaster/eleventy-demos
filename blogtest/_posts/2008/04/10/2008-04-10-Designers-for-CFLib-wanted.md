For the third time in the last 4 years, I've decided one again to try to get a new site up for <a href="http://www.cflib.org">CFLib</a>. I think I'll scale back on my promise to support CFCs and custom tags, and just keep the focus as is - UDFs. What I want though is a whole new design. Right now the site is a bit.... fat. I'd like something that operates almost like <a href="http://www.cfquickdocs.com">cfQuickDocs</a>. It doesn't have to be one page per se - but I'd like something <b>super slim</b> and completely focussed on finding UDFs. 

Anyone want to take a stab at it?
