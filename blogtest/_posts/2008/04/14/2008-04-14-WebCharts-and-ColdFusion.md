A while back I posted quite a few blog entries on charting, including many talking about custom styles using the built in WebCharts engine included with ColdFusion.

A Mr. Vadim Sokolovsky saw these entries and responded with a few pages on gpoint.com (the home of WebCharts3D) that specifically talk about custom charts and ColdFusion. This may be of interest to folks so give it a quick read:
