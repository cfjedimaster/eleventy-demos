I just released <a href="http://galleon.riaforge.org">Galleon</a> version 2.013. This release has the following updates:

<ul>
<li>I fixed an important bug involving user profiles. If encryption was turned on and a user saved their profile w/o changing their password, their old password was lost. It is critical you get this version if you encrypt your passwords.
<li>Two minor cross-site scripting issues fixed.
<li>Here is a nice one suggested by a user: The emails that get sent out for messages will now include #last in the URL. This means when you click, you see the latest messages.
<li>Few other small changes as well.
</ul>
