Just a quick note to let folks I released a small update to <a href="http://lighthousepro.riaforge.org">LighthousePro</a>, my ColdFusion-based issue tracker. The updates include:

<ul>
<li>I finally got off my lazy rear and changed Loci/Locus to Areas/Area. I don't know why I took so long since <b>no one</b> knew what Loci meant.
<li>In Application.cfc, I added code to check for the attachments folder and create it if it doesn't exist.
<li>Fixed some bugs in the main project view, and I now allow you to filter to a ID number. So if you have a lot of bugs and the client says, find bug 212, you can now type 212 and see the bug. 
</ul>
