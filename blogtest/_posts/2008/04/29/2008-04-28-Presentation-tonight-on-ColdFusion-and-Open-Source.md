Tonight I'll be presenting to <a href="http://www.kcdevcore.org/">KCDevCore</a> on ColdFusion and Open Source. The meeting starts at 6:30 CST (Cool Standard Time), but I'm going on around 7:15ish. The online URL is <a href="http://adobechats.adobe.acrobat.com/kcdevcore">http://adobechats.adobe.acrobat.com/kcdevcore</a>. If you can drag yourself away from GTA4, please join me! (And no, I don't have my copy yet, and no, I'm not happy about that! ;)
