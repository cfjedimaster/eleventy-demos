During the keynote at cfObjective, Jason Delmore had a slide up for maybe 30 seconds or so. He hinted that something special was up there, although it was disguised to most as pseudo-code for fun. Looking at the code, and taking Jason's hints - it leads you to think that you may be able to fully develop CFCs with cfscript. I.e., a 100% script based CFC. Possible CF9 feature?
