First off, Todd Sharp has just released <a href="http://slidesix.com/index.cfm?event=">slidesix</a>, which he describes in more detail <a href="http://cfsilence.com/blog/client/index.cfm/2008/5/3/What-Is-slidesixcom">here</a>. It is a presentation hosting service built in ColdFusion (with Model-Glue FTW!). One of the coolest features is that you can record audio for a slideshow directly on the site.

Secondly - NIN has released this second new single, also for free. This time they used Facebook. You can download it <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/ilike/artist/Nine+Inch+Nails/track/Echoplex">here</a>. As I'm in the middle of Mark Madenl's Transfer presentation, I haven't played it yet, but the first free track was pretty darn good.
