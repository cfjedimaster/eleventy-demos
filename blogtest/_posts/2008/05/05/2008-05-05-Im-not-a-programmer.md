Well at least according to Tiobe. I guess this makes me a unicorn herder or some such. I'mnot going to bother linking to the drivel that these guys used for logic as I'm on my iPhone, but please Forta's blog and many others for linkage and better responses.

If anything is "dead" now I'd say it is Tiobe's credibility.
