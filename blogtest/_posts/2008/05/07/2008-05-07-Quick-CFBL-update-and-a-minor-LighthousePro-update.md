Two quickies for the lunch time crowd. As folks remember, I ran a "We are too dang fat" contest back in January. I was proud to say I went from 230 to 211 during the 10 week process. Today I went to the doctor (not for anything important) so I took the opportunity to use a 'real' scale.

<blink><b>196</b></blink>

Yes, I used the blink tag. Sue me. 6 more pounds and I'll be at my goal weight. 

Secondly, I released a small update to <a href="http://lighthousepro.riaforge.org">LighthousePro</a>. This was work done by Ron Stewart and involves some minor cleanup in the project view area. Not a critical update, but I'd grab it anyway.
