Tonight I'll be presenting to the <a href="http://www.cfugitives.com/">Connecticut ColdFusion Users Group</a> at 5PM CST. I do not see a Connect URL yet but I'll post a comment once I have it. The presentation will be on ColdFusion 8 and Ajax, something I've given before, but if you haven't had a chance to see it, tonight's your night.
