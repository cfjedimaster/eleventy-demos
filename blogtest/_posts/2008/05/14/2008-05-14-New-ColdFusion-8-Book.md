Thanks to <a href="http://www.sosensible.com/index.cfm/blog">John Farrar</a> for alerting me of this, but a new ColdFusion 8 book has been announced:

<a href="http://www.packtpub.com/coldfusion-8-developer-tutorial/book">ColdFusion 8 Developer Tutorial</a>

It covers CF 8.0.1 and is expected sometime in August.
