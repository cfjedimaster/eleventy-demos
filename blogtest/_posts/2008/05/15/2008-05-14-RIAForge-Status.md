It was down again this morning, but is back up now. Please continue to email me when you see it done. I just wanted to warn folks about it. As I'm traveling in a day or so, I may not have time to really work on it till I get back from WebManiacs. I'll be sure to blog if the reason behind the crashes are something interesting.

Personally I blame gremlins.
