I was speaking with Charlie Arehart last night and he told me about the class he is giving before CFUNITED:

<a href="http://teratech.com/go/training/class-schedule?trainingaction=detail&TID=332">CF911: Solving CF Performance and Reliability Prob</a>

I want to recommend folks consider signing up for this class. Yes, it will add to your total CFUN bill, but I can say that a large majority of the questions I get involve people who are having trouble finding out what is wrong with their code. Charlie's class is basically a "where do I start" for folks having problems with their CF servers and is something we can <i>all</i> get more familiar with.
