So now that I've begun to use <a href="http://varscoper.riaforge.org">VarScoper</a> I've really been surprised at how bad I am with var scoping. I mean - I'm the guy always complaining about other developers forgetting to var scope. But that's ok. I'm just happy I have the tool. 

Here is a tip I wanted to share with people. This is probably obvious, but I missed it. 

I wanted to start using varScoper for <i>all</i> my projects, but didn't want to have to keep editing the path to check different projects. What I didn't notice though was that his form for the varScoper was a GET form, which means all the attributes (path/file to check, recursive, etc) are in the query string. 

I made a new folder in my Firefox Bookmark Toolbar and I've begun creating shortcuts for all the things I need to check.
