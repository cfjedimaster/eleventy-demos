I updated <a href="http://seeker.riaforge.org">Seeker</a> a few minutes. This is my code that wraps <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/">Lucene</a> functionality. If that sounds like a type of mouthwash to you - just think of Lucene as a search engine, much like Verity, except that Lucene is free and open source. It also runs just fine on OSX. 

The updates I included in Seeker are just bug fixes, but pretty critical bug fixes. Later this week I hope to have the ColdFusion Administrator pages build in to make it even easier to use. I'll be mimicking the Verity admin UI (pretty much) but will also include a search tool (like my <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2007/10/17/ColdFusion-Administrator-Extension--Verity-Searcher">Verity one</a>) that will let you search indexes directly from the administrator. 

p.s. And while I have your attention - my work on wrapping SVNKit as a possible replacement for the front end SVN stuff for RIAForge is close to being done. I'll be releasing that code as well (most likely).
