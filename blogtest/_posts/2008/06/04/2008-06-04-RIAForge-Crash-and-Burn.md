I'm sorry folks - but it looks like the RIAForge machine is down. I'm trying to get support info now, and I'm sure it's temporary, but I wanted to make sure folks knew (and let them know I knew). But hey - I have a late night anyway, so maybe I'll be around to see this resolve itself.

Of course, since I blogged this, the box came back up. I've made some small, but important, changes to hopefully improve the performance, but we will see.
