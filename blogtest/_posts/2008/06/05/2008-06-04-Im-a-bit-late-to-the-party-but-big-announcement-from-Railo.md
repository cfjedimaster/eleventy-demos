I'm probably the last blogger to report this, but <a href="http://www.railo-technologies.com/en/index.cfm">Railo</a> has announced that version 3.1 will be open source and part of JBoss. I think <a href="http://www.jboss.org/railo/">this</a> would constitute the most official press release I can find. 

I never played much with Railo before, but I'm happy to see the OS options for ColdFusion expanding even more. Any of my readers use Railo and care to comment on what this means to them?
