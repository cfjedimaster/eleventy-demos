As this has become something of a meme, I thought I'd chime in with my answers to Liz's <a href="http://cfunited.com/blog/index.cfm/2008/6/4/Count-down-begins--Questions-for-CFUnited-Attendees">CFUNITED Blog Post</a> questions as well.

<b>What are you looking forward to most?</b><br/>
As with most conferences, I'm looking forward to interacting with others. I plan on hunting down Mark Drew for convincing me to get a tat (wait, did I just say that out loud) and then Mark Mandel to thank for him personally for Transfer. (Beer is on me!) 

<b>Which speaker will most likely end up on your camera?</b><br/>
Most likely none. Every year I tell myself to bring my camera and take pictures, but if I do bring the camera I'll probably forget it in the darn hotel room like I normally do.

<b>What do you plan to do outside conference time?</b><br/>
Well at cfObjective, I seemed to spend most of it watching the geek shows I had missed (Lost and BSG) during the conference. ;) At this one I'll probably spend most of my time at the bar since that's where all the best conversations are. 

<b>Fill in the blank: I will mainly be around the ______ booth.</b><br />
I will mainly be around the Savvy Software booth as Joshua is a WoWer like me and I need to bug him for level 40+ tips.

<b>Do you have a new project you are working on and will reveal it at CFUnited?</b><br>
New project? Are you insane? ;) I hope to have <a href="http://seeker.riaforge.org">Seeker</a> at version 1 by then, and CFLib will be updated by then as well. I also want to show off BlogCFC 6, which is still in alpha, but I'd like to expose it a bit to get some feedback face to face.
