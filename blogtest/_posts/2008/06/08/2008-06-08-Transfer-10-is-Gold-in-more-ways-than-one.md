Mark released 1.0 of <a href="http://www.transfer-orm.com/">Transfer</a> today. He talks about it a bit more on his <a href="http://www.compoundtheory.com/?action=displayPost&ID=329">blog</a>. My first personal web site using Transfer will be released in a few days and I'll share a bit of what I learned (painfully) while using the framework. As I alluded to in the title, I really, really like Transfer. It's "Gold" status and frankly good as gold in my book.
