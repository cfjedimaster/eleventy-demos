Today I approved project number 500, yes, 500, for <a href="http://www.riaforge.org">RIAForge</a>. The 500th project was <a href="http://yacc.riaforge.org/">Yet Another ColdFusion CMS</a> by Terrence Ryan. While not the most exciting name, it is the 500th project and Terrence will be getting some nice gifts from Adobe. These gifts include a copy of ColdFusion Standard and Flex Builder. (No gifts from me since I'm cheap. ;) 

Thank you to <b>all</b> the project owners who have used the site and stuck with it through it's ups and downs. I really appreciate it, and obviously big thanks go to Adobe for funding the entire initiative.
