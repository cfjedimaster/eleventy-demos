Just a quick note to say <b>thank you</b> to everyone who showed up for the SciFi Birds of a Feather. I know it was quite a ways away from the conference center, and literally quite deep in the Earth, so I really appreciate you making the trek.

Almost everyone at the BOF had a book/movie/comic/etc to recommend to others, so please use the comments below to make your recommendation.
