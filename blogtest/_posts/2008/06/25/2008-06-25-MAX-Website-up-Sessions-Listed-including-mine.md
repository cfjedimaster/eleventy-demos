A new site for MAX has been launched: <a href="http://max.adobe.com/na/experience">http://max.adobe.com/na/experience</a>. The stuff in the background is a bit too cute for me, and frankly, I'm <i>really</i> tired of auto-play video. It's so fun when you load a site while you are on the phone and have to scramble for the mic. (But I'm an oldie, so I'll stop complaining... one day.)

Most folks want to take a look at the sessions. You can jump to that directly here: <a href="http://max.adobe.com/na/sessions/browser/">http://max.adobe.com/na/sessions/browser/</a>

There seem to be a good collection of ColdFusion sessions this year. I'm giving my ColdFusion and Ajax presentation (again unfortunately - but I'm getting pretty good at it ;). 

I also have another major announcement concerning MAX and ColdFusion. Check back in an hour.
