A reader asked if I ever updated the downloadable code version of <a href="http://www.coldfusionbloggers.org">ColdFusionBloggers.org</a>. I had not done that in quite some time, so today I repackaged up the zip and uploaded. I also fixed the SQL script to include all the latest tables. The code isn't that exciting, but folks can pick apart my jQuery usage and laugh if they want!
