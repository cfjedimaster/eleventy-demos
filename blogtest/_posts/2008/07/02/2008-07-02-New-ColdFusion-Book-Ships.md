<img src="https://static.raymondcamden.com/images/cfjedi/cfdt2.jpg" align="left" hspace="5"> John Farrar's new ColdFusion Book: <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/coldfusion-8-developer-tutorial/book">ColdFusion 8 Developer Tutorial</a> is now shipping. You can even buy an electronic version for immediate download (from what I can tell). It covers ColdFusion up to the most recent update, 8.0.1. Now to guilt John into a free review copy...
