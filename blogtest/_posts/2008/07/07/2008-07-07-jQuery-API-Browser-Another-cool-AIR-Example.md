Remy Sharp has posted a nice AIR jQuery API browser. You can find it here:

<a href="http://remysharp.com/2008/07/04/jquery-api-update-offline-and-anywhere/">http://remysharp.com/2008/07/04/jquery-api-update-offline-and-anywhere/</a>

This is great if you need offline access to jQuery docs. The only thing missing is a generic browser for the API for those of us (like me!) who don't even know what to look for. Remy mentioned though that a browser will be in a future version.
