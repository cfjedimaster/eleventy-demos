For those who like to twit (or who may be a twit), you can now follow <a href="http://www.coldfusionbloggers.org">CFBloggers</a> via Twitter:

<a href="http://twitter.com/cfbloggers">http://twitter.com/cfbloggers</a>

I'm using <a href="http://twitterclient.riaforge.org/">Twitter Client</a> by Elliott Sprehn. If you view <i>all</i> the twits on the account you will see some older entries which come from my testing. Also - I'd love to change the picture if someone can suggest something (as opposed to another picture of me).
