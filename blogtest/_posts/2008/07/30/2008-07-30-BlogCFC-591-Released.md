I've just upated <a href="http://blogcfc.riaforge.org">BlogCFC</a> to version 5.9.1. This is one of the biggest releases in a while. It's mainly a guilt release. As folks know, version 6 has been <i>well</i> delayed. I decided to work on the 5.x branch again and clear up some old bugs and features that I had planned for version 6. So what's new?

<ul>
<li>You can now delete a comment via email. When you get the email notification of a new comment (you being the admin), you have a special link. Clicking on this link will delete the comment without you even needing to log in. Basically, fire and forget.
<li>In the same vein, if you have comment moderation turned on, the email will include a link to approve the comment. (Thanks to Brian Kotek.)
<li>You can now subscribe to an entry without having to post a comment.
<li>Podcasting support. This was written by Brian Meloche. 
<li>For entry enclosures, you can now manually enter a file name. This is handy for files that are too big to upload via HTTP (like files for podcasting).
<li>Multiple small bugs and other changes to generally approve the platform.
</ul>
