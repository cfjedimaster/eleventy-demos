Just some quick update on the <a href="http://www.coldfusioncookbook.com">ColdFusion Cookbook</a>. First off, thank you to everyone who responded to my <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2008/7/1/Bribery-for-the-ColdFusion-Cookbook-and-looking-for-a-grunt-or-two">last call</a> for help. We got more content online and updated the code highlighter thanks to your help. Please keep the submissions coming. 

To make it quicker, I've removed the biggest blocker for new submissions. Me. I've added <a href="http://galleon.riaforge.org">Galleon Forums</a> to the site as a way for users to submit, and help flesh out, new entries. This will allow Jeremy to post new entries w/o waiting as well as making the entire process a lot more open. Even the entries I end up rejecting will be open to discussion.

If folks have any other recommendations, I've set up a <a href="http://www.coldfusioncookbook.com/forums/threads.cfm?forumid=7E8E08A2-19B9-E658-9D1AADC844F21932">forum</a> specifically for that as well.
