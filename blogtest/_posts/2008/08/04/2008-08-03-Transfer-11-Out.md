The title says it all, the latest release of <a href="http://www.transfer-orm.com/">Transfer</a> has been released to the intertubes. While a lot was updated, the main focus of the release was related to performance, which is always a good thing. Mark goes into more detail here:

Oops - looks like it's a Release Candidate, not the "Final" release, but it is definitely worth checking out!
