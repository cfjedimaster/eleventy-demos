So this is just a quick link, but in case you are an iPhone user and somehow didn't know about this, please read:

<a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2008/08/04/the-netshare-debacle-apple-explain-yourself/">The NetShare debacle: Apple, explain yourself</a>

I love my iPhone and Apple, but this type of behavior is pretty scary. 

Hey, maybe we could coordinate some world wide call in at one particular time and have everyone ask the same question: Where is NetShare? A few thousand calls to the support line may get their attention. ;)
