I'll be speaking at the <a href="http://coldfusion.meetup.com/17/">Online ColdFusion Meetup</a> on August 21, 12EST. What I'm speaking on is still in the air. I'd love it if folks who are planning on attending could give me some topic suggestions. Anything but ColdFusion 8 and Ajax, which is cool and all, but I've given that presentation about 10 times this year, and don't want to give it again until I have to at MAX.

So - any ideas?
