And I'm not just saying that because she reads my blog. ;) Since Todd <a href="http://cfsilence.com/blog/client/index.cfm/2008/8/5/A-Major-Milestone-In-My-Marriage">bragged</a> on his wife a few days ago, I thought I'd do the same. While this isn't tech related, it means a heck of a lot to me and I'm incredibly proud of her. 

This month she will be returning to college to pursue a sociology degree. While I've dreamed of returning to college as well, I know it would be pretty darn intense, ok, scary, to be around all those kids. I can still remember going out till 2AM and showing up to an 8AM class and having the 'old guy' (who was probably younger than I am now) smirk at me. 

Along with reentering college, she was accepted on the board of directors at our local <a href="http://www.fhfacadiana.com/">Families Helping Families</a> branch. Our family has experience in dealing with disabilities, my wife especially, so this is a group that she can really help.

So ok, I know 99.99% of you have no idea who my wife is, but hey, be proud with me!
