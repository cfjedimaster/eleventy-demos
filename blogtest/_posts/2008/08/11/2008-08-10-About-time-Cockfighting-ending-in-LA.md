Ok, so I know it's way off topic, but as I've blogged on this before, I thought I'd share the good news that Louisiana will finally be <a href="http://www.katc.com/Global/story.asp?S=8818906&Call=Email&Format=HTML">banning cockfighting</a> this Friday. I know I'll get a few readers (most likely folks from Google searches) who disagree with this change, but I'm very happy to see it. Of course, we also approved creationism in science classes, but that's a whole other argument.
