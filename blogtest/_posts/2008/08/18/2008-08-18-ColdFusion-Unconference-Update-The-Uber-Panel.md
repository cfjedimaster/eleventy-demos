Just a quick note to remind folks about the <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/page.cfm/ColdFusion-Unconference">ColdFusion Unconference</a> coming to MAX 2008. I've filled a few more slots in the last week but I'm still looking for additional speakers.

Oh, and I just now added the Uber Panel on Wednesday at 10:30 AM. This is a panel discussion with some relatively unknown people. I've never heard of <a href="http://www.corfield.org/blog">Sean Corfield</a>, <a href="http://www.carehart.org">Charlie Arehart</a>, <a href="http://www.firemoss.com">Joe Rinehart</a>, <a href="http://www.adrocknaphobia.com/">Adam Lehman</a>, <a href="http://www.cfinsider.com">Jason Delmore</a>, and Raymond Camden. But I thought - wouldn't it be interesting to ask a bunch of ColdFusion newbies all kinds of off the wall, extremely difficult, and controversial questions? While you may not know any of these names, I do think it will make for quite an interesting panel.
