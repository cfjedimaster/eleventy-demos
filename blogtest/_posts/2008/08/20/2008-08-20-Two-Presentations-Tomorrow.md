Tomorrow I'll be doing two presentations. The first meeting is <a href="http://coldfusion.meetup.com/17/calendar/8570144/">CFC 201</a> for the ColdFusion Online Meetup. This will be at 11AM CST. The Connect URL is <a href="http://experts.acrobat.com/cfmeetup/">http://experts.acrobat.com/cfmeetup/</a>. This is basically a tips/tricks/suggestions/etc presentation for components, but I'll be skipping over all (well most) of the syntax stuff.

My next presentation is to the Orange County CFUG and will be at 9PM CST. I'll be talking about error handling in ColdFusion, and touching a bit on the cfqueryparam issue. The Connect URL for that is <a href="http://adobechats.adobe.acrobat.com/occfug/">http://adobechats.adobe.acrobat.com/occfug/</a>.
