Do not forget that registration is open for <a href="http://bflex.info/">BFusion &amp; BFlex</a>, a two day conference being held in Bloomington, Indiana on September 6th and 7th. The first day focuses on ColdFusion and the second on Flex. Best of all - you can't beat the price. Free. 

But just for my readers I have a special surprise. If you register with the code "JEDI", you get 20{% raw %}% off the registration price. That's right. 20%{% endraw %} off. You pay 0.00 instead of 0. That's a great savings and I want to thank Bob Flynn for extending this to my readers!
