For those who are sitting around bored wondering if I'm dead or cutting my way out of my roof yet, here is the latest projection. The pink dot is Lafayette, but I did it by hand and so it may not be 100% precise.

We have some thunder now, and mild winds, but in general it has been pretty nice all day. I went with a friend to get sand bangs. Not that there is any real flooding concern, but we have a pool in the back yard that is a bit raised, and it tends to flood by the back doors when we get rain. So with that in mind, we placed sand bags by them all.

I'll blog again tomorrow to let folks know what's going on. If I lose power, I'll probably switch to Twitter (assuming the cell towers don't fall again like they did for Rita).
