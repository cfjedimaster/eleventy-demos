Ever since it was announced at CFUNITED, folks have been hungry for more details concerning the free edition of ColdFusion for educators. Today Kristen Schofield blogged the details about this offer:

You can also find additional information at the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion/faq/#section-5">FAQ</a>.

I think this is a pretty good deal and I hope institutions take advantage of it. Are any of my readers going to use this?

p.s. Yes, we all survived, with some minor damage to the home. I'm at a friends house "borrowing" their electricity and net connection. When I get power back home I've got a bunch pictures, videos, and details to share.
