Just a quick link to a good blog article by Jochem van Dieten:

<a href="http://jochem.vandieten.net/2008/09/07/tuning-your-coldfusion-logging/">Tuning your ColdFusion logging</a>

He details how you can configure the date mask for the ColdFusion logs. I never really noticed this before, but obviously for folks outside American locales, the use of mm/dd/yy can be a bit vague.
