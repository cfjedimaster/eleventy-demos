I updated both my <a href="http://googlecal.riaforge.org">GoogleCal</a> and <a href="http://googlecontacts.riaforge.org">GoogleContacts</a> projects tonight. GoogleCal was updated to use the new base CFC code GoogleContacts uses. I also added basic support for some of the API methods for getting events that Google supports. Both projects now support hosted Google accounts as well. 

I'm considering maybe merging these two projects into one uber project, like I did for my <a href="http://cfyahoo.riaforge.org">cfYahoo</a> package. Any opinions?
