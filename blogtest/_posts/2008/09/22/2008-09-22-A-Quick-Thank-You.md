I just wanted to give a quick thank you to those of you who have shown your support at the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/registry/2TCL1D08EZEYE">wish list</a>. Just today I got 3 items from it. I try my best to always send a thank you note, but sometimes I get a name with no email address I can find and sometimes, like today(!), two of the items had no name on them at all. (And to be honest, I sometimes put the receipt aside to send a thank you note later, and promptly lose/forget the receipt a day later.) 

So please take this as my thanks to the anonymous masses, and of course, a big thanks to <i>all</i> my readers for even coming here in the first place over the last <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/stats.cfm">three thousand</a> or so blog posts.
