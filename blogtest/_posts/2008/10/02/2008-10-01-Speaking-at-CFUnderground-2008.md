<img src="https://static.raymondcamden.com/images/cfjedi//cf_underground_speaker.gif" align="left" style="margin-right:10px"> I'm happy to announce that I've been asked to speak at CF_Underground 2008, a pre-MAX event. CF_Underground has been around for 9 years, but I think the last time I spoke may have been all the way back at the Florida Dev Con. (It's not that I wasn't asked to speak, but travel plans didn't work out for years.) I'll be speaking along with Adam Lehman, Joe Rinehart, and Jeff Tapper.
