After some feedback from <a href="http://zacster.blogspot.com/2008/10/pagination-can-be-so-1990s.html">Zac</a> regarding <a href="http://www.coldfusionbloggers.org">ColdFusionBloggers.org</a>, I've added a simple way to tweak how many items the aggregator will show per page. If you add ?perpage=X to the URL, where X is a number between 1 and 100, the site will then show that many items per page. It will also store this value in a cookie so you don't need to update your bookmarks.

I think this week I need to make a little AIR app that sits on your dock and uses alerts for new posts. Could be a cool way to keep up to date.
