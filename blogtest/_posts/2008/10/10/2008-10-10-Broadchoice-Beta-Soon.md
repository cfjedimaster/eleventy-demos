Sean <a href="http://corfield.org/blog/index.cfm/do/blog.entry/entry/Broadchoice_Workspace_Beta_starts_soon">posted</a> an update on the Broadchoice Workspace beta. Check out his post for details and some cool screen shots. Basically, the time to <a href="http://www.broadchoice.com/orphan/workspace/">sign up</a> is now! Sean also mentions the iPhone application, which will make my <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2008/10/9/Two-iPhone-development-tips-and-jQuery-to-the-rescue">last post</a> make a bit more sense perhaps. ;)
