I'm happy to announce that <a href="http://lighthousepro.riaforge.org">Lighthouse Pro 2.5</a> has finally been published to RIAForge. It was down a few weeks ago, but as <a href="http://www.broadchoice.com">work</a> ramped up and additional fixes/mods came in I kept delaying the release. I described the updates in an <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2008/9/28/Lighthouse-Pro-25-Beta">earlier blog entry</a> so I won't go into it again, but this is a pretty big update. Note - I have not updated the Subversion repo yet. Sorry! I also forgot to note in the installation instructions that you <b>must</b> install ColdSpring. I'll get those updates sometime this weekend.

I had released a Kuler CFC months ago, but I received notice that the API was updating and would soon require an API key. I've updated and <a href="http://kulercfc.riaforge.org">released</a> my CFC to RIAForge. It adds a bit of functionality that was missing and now supports using an API key (that you provide).

I've had a few people ping me about the YouTubeCFC and the upload method. The issue with uploading is actually due to a small bug in ColdFusion. A hot fix is being prepared for this particular bug. I was told it would be released soon. When it is, I'll release my updated YouTubeCFC (I've made other corrections/updates as well).

Happy Friday. These releases are officially titled the "Zoid Is Old" release build. <a href="http://www.boyzoid.com/blog/index.cfm/2008/10/16/On-Turning-40">Happy Birthday Zoid!</a>
