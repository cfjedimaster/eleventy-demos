<img src="http://www.webbschofield.com/images/tagposter2.png" align="left" style="margin-right:10px"> Just spreading the word here, but Kristen <a href="http://www.webbschofield.com/index.cfm/2008/10/21/ColdFusion-8-Tag-Posters-Available-Now">blogged</a> this morning about the availability of ColdFusion 8 posters. All you have to do (if you didn't do the RIA survey) is register your ColdFusion license.

From looking at the picture to the left, it looks like Adobe has room for about 100 more tags and functions, so I can't wait to see what CF9 brings! ;)
