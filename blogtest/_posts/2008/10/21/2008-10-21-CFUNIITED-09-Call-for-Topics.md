CFUNITED likes to start early! The <a href="http://callforspeakers.cfconf.org/">call for speakers</a> for CFUNITED09 is already open. I've submitted 4 topics, all of which are brand new. (I'm trying like heck to only do new presentations from now on as I've given a <b>lot</b> of duplicate this past year.) This form isn't just for prospective speakers. You can recommend a topic and select another speaker. Personally I think Joe Rinehart wants to talk about Fusebox and someone should be in a recommendation for it!
