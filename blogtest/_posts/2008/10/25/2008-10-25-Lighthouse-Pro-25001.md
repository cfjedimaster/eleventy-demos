I just released a minor update to <a href="http://lighthousepro.riaforge.org">Lighthouse Pro</a>. This is mainly just bug fixes since 2.5, but I did finally get around to adding something folks have asked for in the past. You can now move issues from one project to another. Dan Vega helped out on this feature. I had put it off for so long since I had to worry about related data in the bug that could possibly not exist in the other project. I ended up just checking these properties and setting them to null if they don't exist in the new project.
