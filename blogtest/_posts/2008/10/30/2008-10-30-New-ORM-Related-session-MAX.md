Jason Delmore just <a href="http://www.cfinsider.com/index.cfm/2008/10/30/Object-Relational-Mapping-with-ColdFusion-9">blogged</a> about a new session @ MAX concerning ColdFusion 9 and ORM (Object Relational Mapping).

His session is at the same time as mine, so I bugged him for a sneak peak. It absolutely slick. The bees knees. Like peanut butter <b>and</b> jelly. Definitely check it out if you are attending MAX.
