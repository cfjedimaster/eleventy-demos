Sorry for the lack of posts this week. I've been neck deep in CFML, Groovy, and Flex. I hope folks will forgive the lack of posts but do know that I'm thinking of you. Ok, maybe not really, but I do feel guilty. ;) Josh Orvis sent along this great picture that I had to share. Now <i>that</i> is dedication!
