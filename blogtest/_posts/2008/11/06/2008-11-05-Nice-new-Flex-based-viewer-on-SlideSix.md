If you don't follow/make use of <a href="http://slidesix.com">SlideSix</a>, be sure to read Todd Sharp's latest <a href="http://cfsilence.com/blog/client/index.cfm/2008/11/6/New-Flex-Viewer-Widget-Launched">blog entry</a> on the new Flex front end he built for the slide shows. It is a great reminder that Flex can be used for more than just complete, browser-screen full RIAs. 

So Todd, how about sharing some code?
