Looking for the Birds of a Feather sessions for MAX? It may be a bit hard to find on the MAX side. Thanks to <a href="http://www.corfield.org">Sean</a> for digging this up. Go to the MAX site, Agenda and details, Highlights tab. This URL should get you there quicker: <a href="http://max.adobe.com/na/experience/#?s=1&p=2">http://max.adobe.com/na/experience/#?s=1&p=2</a>

Then scroll down about 1/3 of the way and you can see the schedule. They are on Monday night from 8:30-10:30. There are 30 BOFs total which is pretty darn impressive. 

Unfortunately you can't cut and paste from the site so hopefully Adobe will have a print out at the conference. 

Sorry folks, no SciFi BOF this year, but feel free to hit me up in the hallway to discuss Anathem. :)
