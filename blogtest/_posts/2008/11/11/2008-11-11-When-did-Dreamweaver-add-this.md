I've been using Dreamweaver CS4 for ColdFusion editing the past few weeks. This is mainly due to some writing I'm doing for Adobe and that Eclipse has been a bit cranky for me lately due to other plugins I need for work.

Last night while updating my employee directory application for my latest <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2008/11/10/Managing-Relationships-with-Transfer-2">Transfer post</a> I noticed something rather cool about Dreamweaver. I had added a custom tag named adminlayout. All of a sudden, the next time I typed cf_, check out what the auto-suggest provided:

I guess Dreamweaver noticed the first time I did cf_foo and added it to the autosuggest list. I also assume it is site based (I would hope so). 

Anyone know if this is new to CS4?
