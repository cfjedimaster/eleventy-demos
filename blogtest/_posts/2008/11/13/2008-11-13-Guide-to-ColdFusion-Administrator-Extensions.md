Earlier today I wrote up some thought I've had recently on writing ColdFusion Administrator extensions. You can find the guide <a href="https://static.raymondcamden.com/guide.html">here</a>. It basically covers what the docs talk about but also details some tips and tricks that developers may want to know about. I also listed all the known CF Admin extensions and hope that people can suggest a few I forgot.

So I know like a grand total of 4 or 5 people actually write these things, but maybe this will encourage others to create their own.
