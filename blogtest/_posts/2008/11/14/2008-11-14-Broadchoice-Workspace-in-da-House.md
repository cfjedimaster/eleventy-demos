It's here. We did it. It's launched. After a <i>heck</i> of a lot of hard work, today <a href="http://www.broadchoice.com">Broadchoice</a> released Workspace - our killer collaboration tool built with Adobe AIR and Flex. You can <a href="http://www.broadchoice.com/what_is_workspace/downloads/">download</a> the application now, and be sure to check out the <a href="http://www.broadchoice.com/what_is_workspace/workspace_mobile/">iPhone</a> version as well. (Yes, that's ColdFusion talking to Groovy running that baby!)

Can I get an official ruling? Is it Miller Time? I think it is. (Of course, replace 'Miller' with a decent beer. :)
