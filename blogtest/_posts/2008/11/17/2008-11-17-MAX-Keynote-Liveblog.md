Folks, first off, the wireless is a bit spotty, so I may be a bit slow to update.
<!--more-->
9:37AM<br/>
The keynote opened with an awesome show by Mike Realm, a DJ/scratch artist/whatever I first saw at the Blue Man Group. Frankly the show is done for me - he is <b>that</b> cool.

The boss is up (sorry, I didn't quite get his name, Shatenu?). This is the large MAX ever attendance wise.

9:41AM<br/>
Talking about the non-PC market (living room, mobile, etc). Moving from a 'single screen room' to a multi-screen environment. Adobe's vision is to enable you to deliver the most engaging content over multiple platforms. Referring to "Flash Platform" which I think is a new term for them? Showing the range of prodcts - tools, ramework, clients, servers. Announcing Thermo's new name - Catalyst. Preview build will be available <b>TODAY!</b>

Gumbo (next Flex Builder) will also be available today. Talking about Flash Player 10 (personally I have no idea what is new with it - maybe they added a mute? ;) Showing an example - Product Red. (Helps treat AIDS in Africa.) Waiting to see the connection to Adobe.

Red Wire - a music discovery service. 5 dollars a month. You get an 'issue' every month, delivered via AIR. Ok now this is interesting.

This demo issue is showing off Sheryl Crow and an emerging artist as well. 5 people participating at 5 bucks a month can save one life in Africa.

The host is here now Kevin Lynch. Trends: Client + Cloud (will they mention CF on the cloud??) Second trend is social computing. Third trend is devices and desktop computing.

Client + Cloud: Future is doing processing on the client and using services in the cloud. Flash lets them 'update' the web much easier. Showing FP 10 now and a demo called 'Hobnox' I think. Cool audio mixer. Real time processing of audio in FP 10. You can connect audio to scripting. (Showing a vizualier in FP10.) 3d work looks pretty nice too. Showing a piece o cloth that is -very- well done. Wow, put video on the clith while it moves. Kick Butt.

9:54AM<br/>
Showing text stuff. You can 'draw' text like a paint brush. Showing Japanese text as well. Showing Photoshop.com. Showing new stuff on the site w/ Pixel Bender. Picks a picture and can apply filters. It runs pretty fast. 

Now on stage, the new CTO of Disney's interactive division. Bud Albers. Merge the story telling with new technologies. Talking about how Snow White needed new cameras, new technologies in order to be created (ie, Disney has been an innovator for a while).

For Todd's comment: The chairs are ok now, but ask me again in 30 mins. ;)

So for, just a lot of talk about Disney and how successful it is. I figure folks don't mind if I just kinda skip that here.

10:04<br/>
Kevin is back. Still waiting to hear about the cloud. MLB.com will be using Flash to broadcast all their games. (Take that, Silverlight!) They will have an AIR app. All 4 major sports types in the US use Flash. Talking about AIR now. AIR balances client computing and cloud computing. (Heh, true, Broadchoice knows all about that.) Announcing AIR 1.5 - Linux will be in a few more weeks. Squirrelfish is being used for the browser. Dramatically increases JS execution for AIR aps. AIR 1.5 supports encrypted local data in SQLite. 

A guy from the NYT is there. Talking about proper rendering of his content (I can see that being important for newspapers). Showing AIR front end. Rather simple looking - but I really like it. (Simple is best for reading!) When he resized, it responded extremely well. The entire article layout changes as he changes shape. It is hard for me to describe, but its perfect. Words hyphenate right, and paging changes as well (ie the total # of pages needed).

Nice browse view that lets you scan pages - makes it nice to find an article you like. 

Showing an ad, when he rolled over the ad, it highlighted and if you click, it launches a video (and a cool ad at that for BMW). Oh yeah, and the crossword puzzle works as well.

10:23<br/>
Maria Shriver is on stage - biggest celeb I've seen at Max. Talking about California Legacy Trails. Sorry for the abruptness - had to split a bit.

Kevin is back on stage. Now talking about the cloud side. Talking about the services and APIs Adobe offers. New demo app - Tour de Flex. Shows Flex UI stuff and language reference. Nice to have both a UI browser and docs there all in one app. Cloud APIs list. Over 200 examples of using these things - like Amazon, Flickr, etc. No Kuler? When you click an API you get both the demo/code + the docs. Showing an example of Twitter integration. 

Now showing Salesforce.com (yep, again, Broadchoice knows about this). Senior VP of Salesforce.com coming on stage - Steve Fisher. Heh, enterprise software is where innovation goes to die. Quote. 

Force.com - their platform. Talking basically about how cloud computing lets you focus on innovation, which I can attest to as well. He is a pretty funny speaker - I'd like to see him present again. Showing the main web site for a demo account. Showing extensible apps in his salesforce account. Showing a conference manager. In the middle of the page is a Flex control.

10:37AM<br/>
Kevin Lynch back on. Kinda hope he wraps soon - CFUNCONFERENCE starts soon. (Take this as a warning attendees, I may be a bit late.) On to Social Computing. What is Adobe doing to help you use this within your applications? Nigel Pegg is on on stage now. Talking about Cocomo. Demo of a medical application. It's an AIR app with video running in the upper right hand corner - and audio as well. Shows the remote user 'driving' the app to go into a chart. Stressing the point - it isn't screen sharing - it is conavigating. You can get access to Cocomo today.

New service: <b>Adobe Wave</b> - it gathers messages from mltiple clients (digg, pownce, etc) and brings it into one client. (New product I guess is better to say) Interesting. With all the 'noisy' services out there this could be a nice way to manage it. I didn't see Facebook or Twitter though which seems rather odd.

10:49AM<br/>
Devices and Desktops: Mobile phones and consumer electronics connected to the Internet far outweigh PCs. Sweet, Scott pointed out that Jericho is on the slide. Heh, and the device says 1337, isn't that leet speak? Some geek put this slide today.

Kevin showed the iPhone and said they ARE working on it. I don't think that's news though, is it? I thought that was already out there? Anyway, nice to know. Also working on support for Android. (FYI, wireless getting worse - updates my atop.)

Flash Lite Distributable Player - a way to package your Flash apps so they run as native apps on mobile phones. Example he is showing is being able to get the app - and the app handles installing Flash Lite as well. Seemless install.

Showing example of a prototype mobile device where other screens in the room can 'recognize' your device and interact with it. As he gt closer to the screen it 'synced' and he was able to drag a photo from the device to the large screen. 

Battery is on life support so I'll wrap it now. If anything else cool shows up I'll blog it. Bye for now folks.
