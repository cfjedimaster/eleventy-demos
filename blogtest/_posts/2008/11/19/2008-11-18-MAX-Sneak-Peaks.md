I missed the sneak peaks last night at MAX, but I found an excellent review: <a href="http://www.webkitchen.be/2008/11/19/live-blogging-max-2008-sneak-peak-session/">Live blogging MAX 2008 sneak peak session</a>. This blog entry puts my live blogging of the keynote to shame! I'll have to look into the tool he used before the next conference. Anyway, pay particular attention to the reveal at the end - server side actionscript.
