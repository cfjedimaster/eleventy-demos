Wow, just read this over on Ted Patrick's blog:

<a href="http://onflash.org/ted/2008/11/max-2008-na-session-recording.php">MAX 2008 NA Session Recording</a>

<blockquote>
<p>
We will be releasing this content FOR FREE, WITHOUT GEO-RESTRICTION ON ADOBETV starting the first week of December. We plan to release 20 sessions per week well into 2009. Additionally we will be posting all videos immediately to the MAX NA Group on Adobe Groups for the exclusive benefit of paid attendees. 
</p>

So if you missed MAX, looks like you will get a chance to see it anyway. (And this will let me see the ORM preso I mixed and write up a blog entry on it!)
