Almost a week late, but I've posted my MAX 2008 presentation to slide six: <a href="http://slidesix.com/view/ColdFusion-Powered-AJAX">http://slidesix.com/view/ColdFusion-Powered-AJAX</a> You can download the slides and ColdFusion code from there as well. And just cuz I like embedding, here it is on my blog too:

<object height="425" width="550">
	<param name="movie" value="http://slidesix.com/viewer/SlideSixViewer.swf?alias=ColdFusion-Powered-AJAX"/>
	<param name="menu" value="false"/>
	<param name="scale" value="noScale"/>
	<param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"/>
	<embed src="http://slidesix.com/viewer/SlideSixViewer.swf?alias=ColdFusion-Powered-AJAX" allowFullScreen="true" height="425" width="550" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" />
</object>
