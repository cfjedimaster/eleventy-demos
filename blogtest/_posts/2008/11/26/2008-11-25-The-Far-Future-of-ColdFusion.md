This has been mentioned already, but I wanted to make sure it got as much coverage as possible. I didn't realize this till MAX, but if you download the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/go/cfevangelismkit">ColdFusion Evangelism Kit</a> (thanks to <a href="http://www.webbschofield.com/">Kristen Scholfield</a>) you see mention not only of ColdFusion 9, but ColdFusion 10 (code named Sully and planned for 2010) and ColdFusion 11 (code named Link and planned for 2011) as well.

Not much to say here, but it is <b>really</b> nice to see such extended planning for the best web application platform available.
