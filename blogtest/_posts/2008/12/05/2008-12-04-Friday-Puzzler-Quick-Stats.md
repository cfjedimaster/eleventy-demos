I tend to be kind of a nerd for stats. I check my Google Analytics often and I also check the <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/stats.cfm">stats</a> here every week as well. Both of these options are great, but tend to be more delayed stats than realtime information. 

Your job, if you choose to take it, is to design a way to quickly and simply generate some real time stats for your web site. It is kind of obvious, but as a hint, what functionality in ColdFusion would you use to capture every request? What could you do to remember which URL was requested, and how many times? 

Imagine your boss has just come in and asked to see what is going on, right now, on the live web site, in terms of what pages are being requested. You've got 5 minutes to whip something up to collect the data (and then you can use cfdump elsewhere to display it). What ya gonna do?
