So I recently got a new MacbookPro (more on that later), and during the setup process I took a rather cool picture of myself. A friend wanted a copy of it to use for his cell phone, and that is where the mystery begins. Does anyone know where OSX stores the picture you take during system setup? I did find the collection of static images in /Library/User Pictures, but I can't find the custom picture I took.

If someone finds an answer with the next few hours, I'll promise to recreate the following video with my Flip camera:
