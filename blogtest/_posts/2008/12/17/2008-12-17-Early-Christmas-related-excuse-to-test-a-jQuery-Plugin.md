Warning, this post is nothing more than a) a chance to show off a new picture of the kids (or as I call them, the North American branch of the South Korean Army) and b) quickly test a jQuery Lightbox plugin (which may be found <a href="http://jquery.com/demo/thickbox/">here</a>):

I think it works rather nicely. I tried <a href="http://plugins.jquery.com/project/jquerylightbox_bal">jQuery Lightbox Plugin (balupton edition)</a> earlier but ran into issues trying to get it to run in a non-default file location setup.
