Just a few quick notes about some updates. I'm about to go change for a night out with my wife and her friends to celebrate a birthday so I figured a quick note on low blood sugar was probably in order.

1) <a href="http://soundings.riaforge.org">Soundings</a> 3.0 was "officially" released today. It had been done for a few days now, but I quickly updated the SQL Server script, made a zip, and pushed it out to make it final. 

2) <a href="http://www.cflib.org">CFLib</a> has an 'advanced search' option now. Basically it lets you filter by authors and CF versions. It is only available after a simple search, which seems kind of wrong, but I figured I'd let you guys tell me what makes sense. I can add more filters too if folks want them. 

3) <a href="http://blogcfc.riaforge.org">BlogCFC</a> had a minor fix to correct some issues with cfformprotect integration, which works so well I will probably add it here.

4) <a href="http://lighthousepro.riaforge.org">Lighthouse Pro</a> - this has some nice user submitted fixes, including a good one for sites with numerous projects.

I've also got an update to my GoogleCal code, but I don't think it's quite ready yet for public release. I also did some work in the SugarCRM area, but I have to hold onto that for a few more weeks before I can share more of it.

And with that... I'm out for the night. Peace.
