Nathan pinged me to let me know that <a href="http://coldfire.riaforge.org">ColdFire</a> has been updated. The readme states that...

<blockquote>
<p>
* fixed issues with execution times tab summary rows. (issues 42 and 44)<br />
* fixed issue with variables tab. (issue 43)<br />
* improved multiple tab support.
</p>

He is working on a new update now for Firebug 1.3 and wants to include AMF support. That would be freaking awesome if you ask me. He is looking for help though. If you have experience with the AMF protocol, please <a href="http://coldfire.riaforge.org/index.cfm?event=page.projectcontact">drop him a line</a>.
