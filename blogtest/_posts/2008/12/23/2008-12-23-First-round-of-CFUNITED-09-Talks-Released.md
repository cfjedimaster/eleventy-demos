The CFUNITED blog has just released the first <a href="http://cfunited.com/blog/index.cfm/2008/12/23/Topics-Announced-for-2009--Happy-Holidays">set of topics</a> for CFUNITED 09. Along with the basic list of sessions, they announced that 25% of topics will be in AIR/Flex and that they will be the exclusive conference for Centaur topics. (Well, I'm sure MAX 2009 will have Centaur topics as well.) 

My topics (so far) are:

"ColdFusion, Model-Glue, Hibernate, Spring, and Groovy" - Raymond Camden<br />
"Introduction to jQuery with ColdFusion" - Raymond Camden<br />
"Ajax/ColdFusion 911" - Raymond Camden
