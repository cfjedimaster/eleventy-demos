I'm keeping my 2009 resolutions nice and simple so that I can - you know - actually achieve some of them instead of failing horribly. So in no particular order, here is what I'd like to accomplish this year.
<!--more-->
<ul>
<li>Get really good at Groovy. As folks know, we (we being <a href="http://www.broadchoice.com">Broadchoice</a>) make heavy use of Groovy to power both the AIR and iPhone apps. Groovy reminds me a lot of ColdFusion - fun and practical. I'm not yet sure what I'll do to help improve my skills (outside of the work I do day to day), but I'll probably try a clone of one of my open source apps.
<li>Become an Intermediate Flex developer. I've been using Flex for quite some time now, but I haven't ever really gone beyond simple applications and demos. Luckily I've been able to work with some very smart Flex developers and see what a truly advanced Flex application looks like. My goal is to become a good, intermediate level Flex developer. Graduate from Padawan to Jedi Knight. I'll leave Jedi Master for next year. I've got a good idea for a game that will let me try various techniques I've seen over the past year. 
<li>Thanks to my kind readers visiting my wish list, I've got enough books to keep me occupied for a good year or so. This year though I want to finally read The Fountainhead and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Landmark-Thucydides-Comprehensive-Guide-Peloponnesian/dp/0684827905/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1230829860&sr=8-2">The Landmark Thucydides</a>. These guys have been sitting on my bookshelf for a while now daring me to read them and expand my mind. 
<li>I'll talk more about this at the one year anniversary of the CF Biggest Losers Club, but physically, I want to work on my muscles and exercise routine. I've got a good workout now, but I'm not moving as fast I'd like to pure strength wise. I don't want to lose any more weight but I'd like to increase my arm strength quite a bit this year.
</ul>

Anything I forgot?
