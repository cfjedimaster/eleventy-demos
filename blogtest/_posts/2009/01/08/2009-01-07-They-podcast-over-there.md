I'm a bit late in noticing this, but <a href="http://www.markdrew.co.uk/blog/">Mark Drew</a> reminded me this morning about a podcast put out by the UKCFUG:

<a href="http://www.ukcfug.org/archives.cfm/category/podcast">cf docs</a>

The link above is to the blog's podcast category but you can also directly subscribe via iTunes <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=152536611">here</a>.

Something cool from the land of Dr. Who and Mr. Bean!

Working at home I've yet to become a good podcast listener. Now that gas isn't as expensive as printer ink I should start randomly driving around town just so I can listen in.
