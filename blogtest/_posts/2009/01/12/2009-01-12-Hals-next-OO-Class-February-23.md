Just a quick note to inform people that Hal Helm's next class, Real-World OO Programming, will be held February 23-27 in Sarasota, FL. More details may be found <a href="http://halhelms.com/real-world-oo-programming-sarasota.cfm">here</a>. I would <b>hope</b> folks already recognize that Hal is a legend in the community and his class is very well worth the time and price. Ben Nadel did an excellent multipart review of the class <a href="http://www.bennadel.com/blog/1384-Hal-Helms-On-Object-Oriented-Programming-The-Summary.htm">here</a>. I'd attend myself but I'm trying to limit travel while my wife is in college and the kids are in school. 

To make a good deal even better, if you register with discount code: raycamden, you will get $250 dollars off the price. If enough people sign up I'll get a free pass myself and I'd (hopefully) be able to take it during summer. So you will not only be helping yourself, but me as well. :)
