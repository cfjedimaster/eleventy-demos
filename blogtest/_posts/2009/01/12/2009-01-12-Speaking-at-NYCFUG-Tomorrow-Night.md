<img src="https://static.raymondcamden.com/images/cfjedi//id4.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right:10px"> Tomorrow morning I'll be flying up to New York City to speak at the <a href="http://www.nycfug.com/">New York ColdFusion User Group</a>. I'll be talking about ColdFusion and Ajax (and no, not the same CF8/Ajax talk I've given about twenty times). If you are in the area, please come say hi. I'll have some schwag to give away as well (yes, I'm not above bribery!).
