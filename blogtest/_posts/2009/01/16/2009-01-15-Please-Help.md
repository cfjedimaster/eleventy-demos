I'll keep this short and sweet. If you do not know Joe Rinehart, he is the creator the Model-Glue framework and one of the most important members of our community. Along with being a pillar in the ColdFusion world, he is a darn good nice guy. 

A few weeks ago, Joe <a href="http://firemoss.com/post.cfm/my-wife-dale-rinehart-has-ms-and-a-great-attitude">posted</a> the news that his wife, Dale, had been diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Some of us in the community have decided to set up a way for folks to show their support and help Joe out with the financial side of something I could not even begin to imagine having to live with. 

If you have ever used Model-Glue, or learned something from Joe, then I ask you to please consider making a donation. If you have ever used any of my products - then consider the fact that I have learned quite a bit from Joe myself. You can show your appreciation by sending a quick donation:

Thanks for listening readers, and please help if you can.
