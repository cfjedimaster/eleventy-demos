About 10 days ago or so I <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2009/2/15/Use-Google-Analytics-and-Ajax-Remember-to-update-your-code">blogged</a> about how you can update Google Analytics integrations to support Ajax based applications. I demonstrated how I was going to use it at <a href="http://www.coldfusionbloggers.org">ColdFusionBloggers</a>. I forgot to check on the stats until tonight and I was surprised by what I saw.

First off - the visits value didn't seem to change at all:

But when I switched to page views, there was a big jump:

I guess this makes perfect sense. I didn't get a lot of new people visiting the site, but certainly the registered count of page hits should have improved.
