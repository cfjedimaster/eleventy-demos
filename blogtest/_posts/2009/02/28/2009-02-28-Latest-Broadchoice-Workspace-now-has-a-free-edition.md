This was mentioned on the <a href="http://blog.broadchoice.com/index.cfm/2009/2/27/Announcing-Broadchoice-Workspace-Free-Edition">Broadchoice blog</a> a few days ago, but I thought I'd mention it here as well. The latest version of Broadchoice Workspace was released recently and now includes a free edition. There are a few limitations in the free version, but you can now download it and use it without having to pay a dime. Check it out and let us know what you think. When you do - be sure to check out the snazzy iPhone edition as well.
