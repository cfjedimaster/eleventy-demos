Just a quick note to point out another of my Adobe Developer Connection articles has been published: <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/dreamweaver/articles/spry_creating_xml_data_set.html">Creating a Spry XML data set</a>. The title doesn't make it exactly clear, but this is a Dreamweaver CS4 related article.
