As the manager of <a href="http://www.coldfusionbloggers.org">ColdFusionBloggers.org</a>, I view a heck of a lot of RSS feeds. I've noticed that the description field is always (nearly) impossible to read:

Yet with Firefox under Windows, the same feed's description field is much more easy to read:

I don't really <i>read</i> RSS feeds with Firefox, I just view them in order to get information for adding feeds to my aggregator, but I've wondered if anyone else has ever noticed this?

p.s. Maybe I should just shut up and be happy that Firefox 3 isn't slow as molasses like Firefox 2 was under OSX!
