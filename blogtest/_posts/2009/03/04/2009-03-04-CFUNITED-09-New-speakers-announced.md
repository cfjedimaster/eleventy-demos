Just re-blogging the latest <a href="http://cfunited.com/blog/index.cfm/2009/3/4/New-speakers-and-topics-announced">announcement of new speakers</a> from CFUNITED. It looks like CFUNITED will be only the conference I make this summer (due to personal matters) so I'm happy to see it shaping up so well. In the list of new sessions, I'm particularly interested in the <a href="http://cfunited.com/go/topics/2009#topic-2076">Merapi</a> talk.
