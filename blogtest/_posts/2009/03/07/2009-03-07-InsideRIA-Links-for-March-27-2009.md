I mentioned (either on the blog, or Twitter, or maybe IM, who knows) that I was writing again for <a href="http://www.insideria.com">InsideRIA</a>. I'll be sharing the links to my entries every Saturday or so. If this doesn't make sense, let me know. I figure not everyone is going to check both blogs religiously.
