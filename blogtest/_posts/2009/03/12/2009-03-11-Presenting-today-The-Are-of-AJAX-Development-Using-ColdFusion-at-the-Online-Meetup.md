I'll be presenting today at 11AM CST for the ColdFusion Online Meetup: <a href="http://www.meetup.com/coldfusionmeetup/calendar/9892423/">The Art of AJAX Development Using ColdFusion</a> This is a repeat of my presentation to the NYCFUG a few months ago, except that now I can do it in my pajamas from the comfort of my home. (And you can watch it in your pajamas!)
