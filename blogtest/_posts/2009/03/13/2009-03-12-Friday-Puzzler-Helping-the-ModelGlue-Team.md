For today's Friday Puzzler (yes, I know it's been a while), I have something of a doozy. It may not be a 5 minute puzzle, but it could still be fun, and most of all, it will be helpful to the Model-Glue team. The Model-Glue docs (<a href="http://docs.model-glue.com/">http://docs.model-glue.com/</a>) were written using Robohelp, and unfortunately, the original files are missing. We need to get an "export" of the docs so that they can be republished in a new format. Your task, if you choose to accept it, is to write a scraper for the docs that can download and store each page from the documentation. This needs to keep the HTML for layout purposes, so it can't be just plain text. 

Anyone up for that challenge?
