Just a quick update to let folks know that <a href="http://cfunited.com/blog/index.cfm/2009/3/18/MORE-New-speakers-and-topics-announced-in-March">more sessions</a> were just announced for CFUNITED09. Included in this list is one of my sessions - <a href="http://cfunited.com/go/topics/2009#topic-1828">Charting and ColdFusion</a>. This will be a review/examination of some of the charting options people have with ColdFusion.
