Just a quick note. I know that CFLib submissions are borked. When I did my SQL Server migration last week, I forgot to enable the migration of the extended stuff like PKs, indexes, etc. I've fixed the blog database just haven't gotten to CFLib yet. Sorry for this momentary lapse of quality in my otherwise perfect web site. ;)

<b>Edit:</b> Fixed. Thank you Microsoft for making your Management tool even more confusing/painful in 2008.
