Just got an interesting question in from a freelancer. Chris wants to know if there is a list of web shops that use ColdFusion. There are certainly places to find ColdFusion jobs, and there are listing of sites using ColdFusion, but I'm not aware of a place that list web/design firms who do ColdFusion work for clients. Can anyone recommend something for Chris?
