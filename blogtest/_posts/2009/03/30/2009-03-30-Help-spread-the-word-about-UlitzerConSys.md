The title says it all. You've seen me, and others, in the ColdFusion world blog about Con-Sys before. Well now they are going after the Flash world as well. Help spread the word. Please Digg:

Despite the fact that Aral proclaimed the death of ColdFusion, I'll still help defend him against the evils of Con-Sys. They also attacked Ted Patrick, who is an incredibly nice, standup guy.

p.s. No, I didn't typo "Sys-Con". I 'corrected' their name.
