Every day is a chance to start anew. Every day is a new beginning. While trite, the previous sayings are quite true, and on this first day of April I have decided to take them to heart. I have looked at my life and have come to the realization that I'm making some pretty big mistakes. These mistakes don't just impact me, but others. I have a small following here on this blog, and my other sites, and frankly, I worry I may have led folks astray. I <b>must</b> do something about it or I will never forgive myself. It is, as I said above, time to begin anew. It is time <b>to get SERIOUS</b> and stop joking around. With that in mind, I promise to...

<p>
1) Stop using silly variables in my code samples. What, pray tell is, the point of the variable below? You tell me:
<p>
<code>
&lt;cfset parisHilton = createObject("component", "com.celebrities.trash")&gt;
</code>
<p>

I mean serious, what do these two things have in common?
<p>

<p>

Let's be honest. I'm whoring my blog for Google AdSense. Does that help the community? No. From now on, I'll use serious variable names. All variable names will use East Hungarian Pre-WW1 Variable Name Scheme Rules (Rv. 2). Example:
<p>

<code>
&lt;cfset -&lt;x&gt;-*y = "%third";+4!&gt;
</code>
<p>

(By the way, that outputs "Hello World", but we all knew that, right?)
<p>

2) No more talking about Star Wars. Star Wars is for <b>kids</b>, not grown men. I'm clearing my room of all Star Wars toys and replacing them with copies of Ayn Rand books and tag posters. Also, in relation to rule #1 above, no more using Star Wars planets for code samples. It's stupid. I shall have <a href="http://www.coldfusionjedi.com/images/tat.jpg">this</a> stupid thing lasered off my body at my earliest convenience. And as for ColdFusion Jedi? Seriously? How long have you guys been laughing at me. Am I four years old?

<p>
3) No more off topic posts. No one cares about Lost. It's a fad. It will soon go away like pet rocks and the cfinsert tag. No one cares what the Island is or what in the heck fhe four toe state means. 
<p>

4) No more "simple" posts. I tend to do posts that share simple tips, like how to handle interpolation in cfchart. While this may be useful to a few people here and there, it isn't <b>serious</b>. It doesn't reflect the real, day to day work most ColdFusion developers are doing. Most of all, it isn't Object Oriented. I don't know about you, but before my morning bowel movement I typically write a few delegates and at least one active record CFC. Why aren't I blogging about that more? OO is in everything I do, and from now on, every blog entry will deal with OO, and OO only. OO is for serious developers and I'm a serious developer darnit!
<p>

5) A casual dress implies a casual mind. No more working in shorts and a tee shirt (with optional shoes). Today I begin my official, and daily, new dress code...
<p>

6) And finally, no more going hyper over the 'lastest' cool thing. If you follow my Twitter and this blog, you know a typical day for me is something like this:
<p>

<blockquote>
<p>
DUDE! I just found out about the cfoutput tag. It is AWESOME!!!!
</p>
<p>
WOOT! I tied my shoes while reading about jQuery! jQuery FTW!!!!!
</p>
<p>
OMG - Tomcat didn't build. WTF?!?!?!?!?!?!? I love Tomcat but it isn't perfect. IT SUXORS!
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>

From now on, I promise to take a more slower, serious, and sensible approach about the things that interest me. For example, consider this pre-Serious Ray:
<p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Dude! ColdFusion 9 is so FREAKING awesome. I can't say why, but it is. It's got more cowbell than a dairy farm!
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>

And this is how I'll handle it now:
<p>

<blockquote>
<p>
ColdFusion 9 will have a version number one higher than the previous version. At least according to my inside sources.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>

I hope my readers will agree. This new, more direct, Raymond, will be much better than the silly "ColdFusion Jedi Master" of the past. Welcome April. Welcome Full On Seriosity!
