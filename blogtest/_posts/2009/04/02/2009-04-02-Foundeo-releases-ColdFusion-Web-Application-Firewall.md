Got an email a few minutes ago from Foundeo announcing their <a href="http://foundeo.com/security/">new firewall</a> product written completely in ColdFusion. Stealing a bit from their email to me, features include:

<ul>
<li>Cross Site Scripting / XSS
<li>SQL Injection
<li>Session Hijacking
<li>Cross Site Request Forgery
<li>CRLF Injection
<li>Path Traversal Attacks
<li>Password Dictionary Attacks
<li>Extensible CFC API for writing your own Filters and Loggers
<li>Configure it in a language you already know - CFML!
<li>Runs on most shared hosting accounts
<li>Runs and Tested on ColdFusion 6.1+, OpenBD 1+, Railo 3+
</ul>

Seems pretty impressive. I haven't used it myself, but if anyone wants to review it in the comments below, I'd love to hear more.
