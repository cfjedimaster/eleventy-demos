<img src="http://www.fusion-reactor.com/common/images/layout/logolabs.png" style="padding: 5px" align="left"> Forgive the slow blogging day. Got a bit of a shock earlier (not going into it now) and am scrambling to do my final preparations for CFUnited Express Atlanta (remembered one last thing I wanted to add to my demo!). I wanted to share a quick news item. The fine folks at Intergral released <a href="http://www.fusion-reactor.com/labs/fd_railo.cfm">FusionDebug for Railo 3.1</a>. I have not had a chance to try it yet (nor have I tried Railo 3.1, but hey, maybe I'll have more time to do so), but this looks to be a pretty impressive support tool for Railo users. Check the <a href="http://www.fusion-reactor.com/labs/fd_railo.cfm">link</a> for details and screen shots.
