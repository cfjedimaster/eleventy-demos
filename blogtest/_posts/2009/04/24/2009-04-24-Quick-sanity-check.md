When I started blogging at <a href="http://www.insideria.com">InsideRIA</a> a month or so ago, I promised to post link lists every weekend or so. I never did. Now that I'm also blogging at <a href="http://www.alagad.com">Alagad</a>, do folks follow me there as well? I typically do a quick Twit for <i>every</i> blog post, but, just wondering if I should make a habit of posting the list of external links here every weekend?
