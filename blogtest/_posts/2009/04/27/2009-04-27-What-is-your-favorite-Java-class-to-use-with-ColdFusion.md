While ColdFusion can do almost anything, there are times when we need to resort to Java in order to do something ColdFusion can't. This can be using another JAR for a feature not implement by ColdFusion, or perhaps just relying on createObject to make an instance of a built-in Java object. So let me ask - which Java class have you found to be the most useful? For me it is <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/StringBuffer.html">StringBuffer</a>. I've only had to use it a few times, but it was incredibly helpful in cases where I was creating a large string on the fly. (Like my <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/projects/toxml/">toXML</a> CFC.)
