So last night I blogged an Amazon Affiliate link (<a href="http://snurl.com/h4kux">http://snurl.com/h4kux</a>) for the very excellent Learning jQuery 1.3. (I'll try to get my review up this week.) I decided to take a quick look at my Amazon stats to see if anyone had purchased it. Turns out someone had, which is cool. I now have (or will have) 2.13 in my pocket. I think Amazon has a pretty good deal here for bloggers (or actually, Twitters, emailers, whatever, it works!)

But then I noticed something... a bit unusual. Apparently I also got referral money for...

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WJKE1Y">Himalayan Institute Original Neti Pot Complete Sinus Cleansing System Starter Kit</a> - I'm not quite sure what that is, but any product with that many names in it has to be more advanced then the Space Shuttle. 

But wait - it gets better. The next link I noticed?

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061728977">Act Like a Lady, Think Like a Man: What Men Really Think About Love, Relationships, Intimacy, and Commitment</a> - Wow. Um, ok. Personally I probably have an easier time with machines than humans, but I've probably got a touch of Aspergers. 

And then it got even better. The coup de grace. The ultimate WTF did that come from...

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0967602823">The Guide to Becoming the Sensuous Black Woman (And Drive Your Man Wild In and Out of Bed!)</a>

Hey, I'm not sure who ordered this, or whether or not I'm <i>seriously</i> misunderstanding my readership, but whoever it was, thanks for the 90 cents. I'm not quite sure how someone becomes <b>the</b> Sensuous Black Woman. I would have assumed there would be more than one. But maybe it's some Highlander thing us geeks aren't aware of?
