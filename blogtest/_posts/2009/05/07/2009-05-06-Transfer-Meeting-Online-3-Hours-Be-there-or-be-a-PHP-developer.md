At 11AM CST I'll be giving an online presentation on Transfer ORM. You can find more details, including the URL for the meeting, <a href="http://www.meetup.com/coldfusionmeetup/calendar/10314110/">here</a>. This meeting <b>will</b> be recorded, so if you can't attend live, you can always watch it later. (I hear my voice goes well with a nice glass of chardonnay and Enya in the background.) This presentation will probably be around 1.5 hours long, so you may want to bring your lunch along.
