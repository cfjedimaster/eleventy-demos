Not much more to add to the title, but the <a href="https://max.adobe.com/">MAX 2009</a> site has been updated. Once again Adobe goes for auto-play, loud video. Don't get me wrong, I think the video is cool, but seriously - who <i>doesn't</i> get that auto-play is normally a really bad idea? Am I the only one? (Maybe)

So bitching aside, I am happy to say that the <a href="https://max.adobe.com/#sessions_discussions">Unconference</a> were announced and ColdFusion will once again be featured. I don't have any details yet (we have a meeting with the MAX folks tomorrow), but I'll be posting details to the same URL I used for last year: <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/page.cfm/ColdFusion-Unconference">http://www.coldfusionjedi.com/page.cfm/ColdFusion-Unconference</a>
