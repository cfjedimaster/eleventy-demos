Just a quick note to say my latest Adobe Developer Center article just went live: <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/dreamweaver/articles/spry_dynamic_dw_site.html">Using Dreamweaver, InContext Editing, and Spry to build a dynamic site</a>. Looks like I need to update the bio though. If you've never looked at, or even heard of, InContext Editing, definitely read the article. I was really pleasantly surprised by how cool it worked.
