Ok, nothing really <i>new</i> here, but I finally got around to formally releasing the CF Cross Operating System guide. You can see it in the Links pod to the left, and it joins my other development guides that I hope folks find useful in their day to day development. The guide may be found <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/page.cfm/Cross-Operating-System-ColdFusion-Development-Guid">here</a> and if you have any suggestions, just send me an email.
