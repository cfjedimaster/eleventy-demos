First off - sorry for the downtime at <a href="http://www.riaforge.org">RIAForge</a> this weekend. I was out of town until yesterday afternoon, and just got time to work on it today. Turned out to be kind of a silly issue. The host had contacted the account owners (other people at Adobe) about a required IP update, and I never got the news. I've made sure they know to contact me from now on so something like this shouldn't happen again.

Oh... and is it just me - or is there a <a href="http://www.riaforge.org/index.cfm?event=page.category&id=14">new category</a> up at RIAForge? Obviously I can't talk much about it, so please don't ask me details here, but I was told to go ahead and set it up, so perhaps it's time to start getting <i>real</i> excited? Pay special attention to <a href="http://riaforgedownloader.riaforge.org/">this project</a>, especially the <a href="http://riaforgedownloader.riaforge.org/index.cfm?event=page.projectscreenshots">screen shots</a>. In case it isn't obvious: Yes, that's browsing and downloading RIAForge projects direct from Bolt.
