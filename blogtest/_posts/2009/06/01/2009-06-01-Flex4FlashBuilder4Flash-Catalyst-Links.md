It's been a busy day. I've twittered/re-tweeted a bunch of these links, but thought I'd do a quick blog entry concerning some links that I think may be important for folks taking a look at the new goodness released today on <a href="http://labs.adobe.com">Adobe Labs</a>. Most likely some of these links repeat the same content, but I hope folks find it helpful.

<ul>
<li>First off, check out <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/articles/fcf_flex_for_coldfusion_developers.html">this video</a> by Tim Buntel: Flash Builder 4 (is it FlashBuilder or Flash Builder?) beta 4 for ColdFusion developers. It is a 12 minute video that you can easily watch during your lunch hour covering stuff specifically for ColdFusion developers.</li>
<li>This next article, <a href="http://anirudhs.chaosnet.org/blog/2009.06.01.html">Network Monitor in Flash Builder 4</a> covers the... wait for it... I'm about to say it... the Network Monitor. Ok, sorry for the silliness. This is, without a doubt, one of the cooler parts of Flash Builder 4. It totally removes the need for tools like ServiceCapture or Charles.</li>
<li>If you are like me, you may be a bit overwhelmed by the changes in Flex 4. This article: <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/articles/flex3and4_differences.html">Differences between Flex 3 SDK and Flex 4 SDK beta</a> can help you digest some of what has changed. Personally I'm finding the namespace changes to be quite significant. I'm going to have to digest this a bit before I really get it.</li>
<li>This is probably a bit of a repeat, but there is a Dev Center at Adobe just on ColdFusion and Flex: <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/flex_cf.html">Learn Flex and ColdFusion</a></li>
<li>Check out these <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/flashbuilder4/tutorials/">tutorials</a> from Adobe Labs.</li>
<li>Lynda.com, AKA the people who turned me down (not that I'm bitter, really!) announced free video tutorials on Flash Catalyst. More information may be found here: <a href="http://www.lynda.com/flashcatalyst">http://www.lynda.com/flashcatalyst</a></li>
<li>Next - while this isn't a "Learning" type link, I wanted to share it. Ted Patrick is looking for community involvement in creating Catalyst skins. I sent him one, but I think it melted his computer. (Keep me away from design toools!) More information on his blog post: <a href="http://onflash.org/ted/2009/06/where-community-and-catalyst-meet.php">Where community and Catalyst meet</a></li>
</ul>

That's it for now. My plans are to review the changes in Flex 4 and hopefully write up a more detailed blog post. As I said, it is a bit overwhelming. But folks - now is the time. The Flex/Flash platform looks <b>incredible</b> now. If you are one of those ColdFusion folks who haven't taken the chance to learn Flex, <b>now is the time</b>. Do it. And if I can help in any way, let me know.
