I wanted to make sure my readers took the time to read Tim Buntel's latest blog post: <a href="http://www.buntel.com/blog/index.cfm/2009/6/16/Desperately-seeking-Debbie">Desperately Seeking Debbie</a> The title may seem a bit risque, but don't be worried. Tim is looking for help from a type of developer that I think matches a large portion of my audience. If you haven't had a chance yet to look much at Flex 4, and have time in the next few days, please be sure to follow the directions on his <a href="http://www.buntel.com/blog/index.cfm/2009/6/16/Desperately-seeking-Debbie">blog post</a>. 

I'm going to be a bit vague here but let me just say that I think this is pretty important. If you <i>can</i> make the time and meet the persona, please contact Tim. Thank you!
