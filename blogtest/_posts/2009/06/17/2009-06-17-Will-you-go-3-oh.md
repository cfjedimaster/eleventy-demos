Last year I <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2008/7/11/So-far-iPhone-20-is-DOA">blogged</a> about my experience upgrading my iPhone to 2.0. Little did I know that within a few hours I'd have a few hundred comments. It ended up being the most commented blog entry on my blog (972, almost 1k!) and my 6th most visited entry over all.

So given that the upgrade was a bit... rough last time - who is going to hold off doing the upgrade this time? I know I'm not going to wait. Working at home, even if my phone bricks, it isn't the end of the world.
