I pushed up <a href="http://lighthousepro.riaforge.org">LighthousePro</a> to RIAForge. This isn't a major update in functionality (although it has a few updates and some jQuery-lovin' added) but it is now a Model-Glue 3 sample application. It will ship with Model-Glue 3 and hopefully serve as a good example of what can be done with the framework.

Of course, even if you don't give two hoots about Model-Glue 3, this is still a good update for you and will help improve the product overall. 

Please post any bug reports to the <a href="http://lighthousepro.riaforge.org/index.cfm?event=page.issues">LHP issues page</a>. Thanks!
