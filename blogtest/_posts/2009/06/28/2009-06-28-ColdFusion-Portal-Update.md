Just a quick note to let folks know that I've updated the <a href="http://www.coldfusionportal.org/">ColdFusion Resource Portal</a>. I don't think folks visit this site very often. I created it mainly because I had trouble finding things on the Adobe site. I noticed how well Flex.org organized important links for Flex dev so I created a similar set of links for the CF portal. 

In this update I switched over the Spry tabs to jQuery UI tabs. I didn't remove Spry completely though - it is still being used to load the RSS feeds in the right hand column. I also removed a lot of content that can be found elsewhere. So for example, I no longer list blogs, but rather tell people about <a href="http://www.coldfusionbloggers.org">ColdFusionBloggers</a>. Ditto fur User Groups - most groups are now listed at <a href="http://groups.adobe.com">Adobe Groups</a>, so I simply let folks know where to go.

I hope people still find this little site useful!
