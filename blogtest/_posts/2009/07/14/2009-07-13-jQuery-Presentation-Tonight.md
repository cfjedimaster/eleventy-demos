Sorry to blog on something <i>not</i> related to ColdFusion 9, but tonight I'll be presenting to the <a href="http://www.cfugitives.com/">Connecticut CFUG</a> on jQuery and ColdFusion. This is a repeat of an presentation I did earlier in the year, but with a bit more focus on ColdFusion, and yes, I do bring up ColdFusion 9. 

The presentation will be at 5PM CST. My contact David said food will be served, so I assume they will be using the new FOIP (Food Over IP) standard to share with us. Awesome!
