With the release of ColdFusion 9, Adobe also produced some ColdFusion 9 specific videos. By Adobe I mean Ben and I. ;) You can find these videos at Labs: <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/coldfusion9/videos/">http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/coldfusion9/videos/</a>

This was my first time working in front of a green screen, and it was pretty cool actually.

<i>Everything</i> you see behind me there is 100% virtual. I know green screen tech isn't new, but it's still kinda cool to see it in action!

I've attached a zip to this blog entry that contains all the code I used when working with the videos. Some of the VFS files won't work as they require a database, but I think it will give you enough of an idea as to what is going on.<p><a href='enclosures/E{% raw %}%3A%{% endraw %}5Chosts{% raw %}%5Cwww%{% endraw %}2Ecoldfusionjedi{% raw %}%2Ecom%{% endraw %}5Cenclosures{% raw %}%2Fforblogpost%{% endraw %}2Ezip'>Download attached file.</a></p>
