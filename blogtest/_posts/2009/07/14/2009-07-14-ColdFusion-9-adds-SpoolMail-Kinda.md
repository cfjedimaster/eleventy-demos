One of the new features in ColdFusion 9 was inspired (I think so anyway) by my <a href="http://spoolmail.riaforge.org">SpoolMail</a> project. If you go to the mail settings in your ColdFusion 9 Administrator, you will see:

This brings you to a new page that allows you to browse email sitting in the undelivered folder. This is a great tool for checking emails sent out by ColdFusion on a development machine, which are normally not set to talk to a real mail server. Click the thumb for an example of the UI:
