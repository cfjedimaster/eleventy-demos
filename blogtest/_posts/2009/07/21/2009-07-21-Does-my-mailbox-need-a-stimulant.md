Forgive the non-ColdFusion, non-Ajax, non-anything important post, but this was too funny to pass up. Today we had a little notice with our mail. Be sure to read the comments:

Wow. "Extremely annoying"?  "Back injury"? Who knew the perils of a slightly leaning mailbox!

To be fair, the mailbox was put up by myself, and being a software guy, well, it isn't 100% straight:
