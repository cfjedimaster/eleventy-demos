Just helping spread the word here, but in case you had not heard....

First up is <a href="http://www.riadventure.com/">RIAdventure 360</a>, otherwise known as the conference on the boat, and hopefully not of the '3 hour tour' variety. Headed up by Joshua Cyr (who I blame for getting me addicted to WoW), this cruise is a combination vacation and coding summit. Your price includes the cruise itself plus the content of course, so you both learn and relax. This conference will be held in December.

Next up is <a href="http://www.cfinnc.com/">CFinNC</a>, a ColdFusion/Flex/AIR conference being held in Raleigh, North Carolina on October 17th and 18th. You can't beat the price either - free!

As a quick side note, I'm <i>real</i> happy to see so many new conferences popping up. Most are small, but I think these can be more intimate as well, and tend to bring out a different crowd, which is a great thing!
