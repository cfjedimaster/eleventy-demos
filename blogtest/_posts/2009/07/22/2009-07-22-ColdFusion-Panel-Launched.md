Woot! Todd Sharp and Dan Vega just announced the release of <a href="http://www.cfpanel.com">ColdFusion Panel</a>. This is a new podcast in a live format that - surprise surprise - will consist of a panel of rotating speakers on different topics. The first session has been <a href="http://cfpanel.com/index.cfm/2009/7/22/Episode-1--ColdFusion-9-and-ColdFusion-Builder">announced</a> for next Tuesday (of course, when I'm on vacation, those jerks!) at 12PM EST.
