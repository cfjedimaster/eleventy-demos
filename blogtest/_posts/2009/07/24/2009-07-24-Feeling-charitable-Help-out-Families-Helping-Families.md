<img src="https://static.raymondcamden.com/images/cfjedi/lynntsa.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right:10px" /> My wife is the board chair of a local charitable organization - <a href="http://www.fhfacadiana.com/">Families Helping Families of Acadiana</a>. This organization helps both children and adults with developmental delays. It tries to give families the tools and resources to best take care of their families members who need some extra help. They are having a fund drive and could really use the donations. You can download the <a href="http://www.fhfacadiana.com/FHFgolfupdated.doc">Golf Tournament Fundraiser Form </a>for more information. You do not have to actually attend/participate in the golf tournament to donate. Since I am <b>not</b> above guilt trips - the picture to the left is my daughter. I don't speak a lot about her issues - but she is definitely someone who gets support from this organization.
