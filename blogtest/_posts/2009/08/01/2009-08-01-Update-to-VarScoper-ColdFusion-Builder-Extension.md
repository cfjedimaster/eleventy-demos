Just a quick note - Mike has integrated the ColdFusion Builder Extension for <a href="http://varscoper.riaforge.org/">varScoper</a> directly into the core project itself. Because of this, it doesn't make sense for me to have my own little wrapper, so I've closed my project down. (Technically I kept it open and let people know about the status.) Mike has more details on the updates on his <a href="http://www.schierberl.com/cfblog/index.cfm/2009/7/27/varScoper-130-release-with-CF-Builder-extension">blog</a>. I still think CFB's extensibility is one of the best features and I'm happy to see such movement in the area. There are now <a href="http://www.riaforge.org/index.cfm?event=page.category&id=14">13 projects</a> at RIAForge in the CFB Extensions category which is pretty darn good for an unreleased product! (I said 13 and not 14 as my varScoper Extension is still listed.)
