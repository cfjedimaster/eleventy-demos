I'd like to quickly remind people about my <a href="http://cfunited.com/2009/topics/230">Ajax/ColdFusion 911</a> presentation. If you are planning on attending this session, please try to bring along some problems, questions, or interesting examples of ColdFusion and Ajax. This class is <b>not</b> meant to be a normal lecture but rather a group discussion. I will have slides in the first portion, and I've got a good story to tell as well (about my experience with Lighthouse Pro specifically), but I want to see a lot of group discussion in this class.
