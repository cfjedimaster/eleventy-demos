This just got <a href="http://cfunited.com/blog/index.cfm/2009/8/6/CFUnited-mobile-schedule">blogged</a> over at the official CFUNITED blog, but I thought I'd point it out as well. I worked on a iPhone version of the schedule for CFUNITED. The idea was that I was tired of carrying around a paper based version of the schedule. I also wanted a quick way to find out what session was coming next. This application accomplishes that - along with search as well. You can find it here - but I'll warn you that the CSS is tuned for the iPhone and renders a bit oddly on Firefox: <a href="http://mobile.cfunited.com/2009">http://mobile.cfunited.com/2009</a>. Thanks to Elliott for help getting it working under their platform.
