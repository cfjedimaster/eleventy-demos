Tomorrow I'll be speaking on the ColdFusion Panel about the future of ColdFusion. I'm with a very smart group of guys - Adam Lehman and Sean Corfield. Hopefully my head cold will clear up by then - and if not - the drugs will make for interesting conversation. More details may be found at the blog post:
