This is more an FYI than anything else - but I wanted to make sure folks knew that the recent <a href="http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/511/cpsid_51180.html">"cumulative" hot fix</a> for ColdFusion did <b>not</b> include any of the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/support/security/bulletins/apsb09-12.html">security hot fixes</a> from last month. Now I know that hot fixes are not meant to be <i>required</i> things for your ColdFusion server, but at the same time, Adobe refers to the security changes as hot fixes and I'm not quite sure how you could look at those as not required. I think if you use the word "cumulative" you are <i>really</i> leading folks to think that it includes <b>everything</b> and that just isn't the case here. 

So - please - help spread the word. If you agree with me that this is unnecessarily confusing, please bug Adobe. 

By the way - I'd love it if the ColdFusion Admin would check a web service for stuff like this. That way every time you log in you could see a little notice that new hot fixes were available.
