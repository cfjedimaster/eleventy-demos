<img src="https://static.raymondcamden.com/images/cfjedi/cfdudesmall.png" align="left" title="CF Dude says - ColdFusion Rocks!!"/> Simon Free has launched a new contest in support of the multiple upcoming ColdFusion conferences. <a href="http://winacfdudecamera.com/">Win a CF Dude Camera</a> is simple. Simply write a short answer to the question, "Why does ColdFusion Rock?" or if you are new to ColdFusion, "Why am I excited to learn ColdFusion", and then register to attend one of the three related conferences (CFinNC, bFlex/bFusion, RIA Unleashed). One winner from all three conferences will be selected and will receive a custom CF Dude Flip Video camera (which, by the way, are pretty darn cool cameras). Register today and submit your entry. Also be sure to follow the contest on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/winacfdude">Twitter</a>.
