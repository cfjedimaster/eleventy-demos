Many weeks ago I spoke about how I was going to work with Adobe to migrate content off of the <a href="http://www.coldfusioncookbook.com">ColdFusion Cookbook</a>. Today the new cookbooks at Adobe have officially launched. The ColdFusion content is still "in progress", but a big thank you goes to Adobe for doing the grunt work. The new cookbook site may be found here:

<a href="http://cookbooks.adobe.com/home">http://cookbooks.adobe.com/home</a>

As you can see, it's got a sexy new UI as well:

Best of all, the site was built in ColdFusion! You can find RSS feeds for content as well as a feed for requests. While it's empty now, here is the RSS for ColdFusion recipe requests: <a href="http://cookbooks.adobe.com/rss/recent/requests?technology=coldfusion">http://cookbooks.adobe.com/rss/recent/requests?technology=coldfusion</a>. 

As I said - the ColdFusion Cookbook content <i>is</i> being migrated over (both by Adobe and some individual authors) so it's going to grow pretty quickly.
