OK, so technically I'm not leaving for MAX till 7AM tomorrow morning, but please consider this my "I'm outa here, see ya later" notice. As always, the rule is that you will not find any bugs in my open source software while I'm gone (old school or not). On a serious note, any emails sent to me over the next week may take a while to respond to, so give me a bit of time to catch up in the next few weeks. I'll also remind folks about my Twitter account (<a href="http://twitter.com/cfjedimaster">cfjedimaster</a>) as I'll probably be writing a lot more tweets than blog entries. Los Angeles, here I come!

p.s. Freaky, a few seconds before I hit Save on this blog entry, Google sent me a SMS to remind me of MAX. ;)
