I wanted to make sure folks read Terry Ryan's blog entry on ColdFusion 9 license changes: <a href="http://www.terrenceryan.com/blog/post.cfm/coldfusion-9-eula-changes">ColdFusion 9 EULA changes</a>. Please give it a read. This is huge news for ColdFusion shops. I especially love this quote: &quot;We made both of these changes because it was important to us that developers not be penalized for following best practices.&quot; Here here!
