So I know that everyone knows this, but have you read the release notes for ColdFusion 9 yet? You can find them here:

<a href="http://www.adobe.com/support/documentation/en/coldfusion/9/cf9_releasenotes.pdf">http://www.adobe.com/support/documentation/en/coldfusion/9/cf9_releasenotes.pdf</a>

I mention this because, while reading it, I found not one, but <b>three</b> issues that either myself, my friends, or my readers, have recently had issues with and they were all known bugs. 

Please give it a quick read.
