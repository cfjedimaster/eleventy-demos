Just a quick note to let folks know that the good folks at Integral (hey, where is my darn FusionAnalytics beta???) have released an update to their flagship FusionReactor product. Version 3.5 brings <a href="http://www.fusion-reactor.com/newsletter/latest.cfm">new features</a> including support for ColdFusion 9 and OSX Snow Leopard. Further details may be found on the <a href="http://www.fusion-reactor.com/support/kb/FRS-230.cfm">release notes</a>.
