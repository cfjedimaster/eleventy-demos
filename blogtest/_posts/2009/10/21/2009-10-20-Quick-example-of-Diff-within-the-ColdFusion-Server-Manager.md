I was pleasantly surprised to discover (thanks to a follower on Twitter) that the new AIR-based ColdFusion Manager for CF9 actually supports diffing between servers. This is an excellent way to compare settings between multiple different servers. I whipped up a quick video (click the image below to load the SWF) that shows a demonstration of this. Pardon the slowness of my speech, the coffee hasn't fully booted my internal OS yet.
