This is pretty cool - Adobe will be starting a multi-city tour this month offering <b>free</b> training in Flex and Flash Builder 4. This training is specifically targeted to experienced ColdFusion developers. Did I mention it was free? Yep - 100% free. The tour begins on November 13 in Texas and ends on the 20th in San Francisco. You can find a complete list, and more details, here: <a href="http://www.ce1.com/adobe/2009/flextrainingforcfdevelopers/">http://www.ce1.com/adobe/2009/flextrainingforcfdevelopers/</a>. It looks like registration is required and limited, so get to it!
