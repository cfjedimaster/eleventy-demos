I just released <a href="http://blogcfc.riaforge.org">BlogCFC 5.9.5</a> to RIAForge. The readme describes all the changes, but the major focus in this release on improving the editor (lots of jQuery love!). I took a quick video demonstrating some of the new features. I know I need to get a better way of embedding videos on here, but for now the image below will take you to the SWF file directly.

Sorry for the all the "uhs" and junk. For some reason I tend to clench up when doing Jing videos. I blame the software. It can't be my fault!
