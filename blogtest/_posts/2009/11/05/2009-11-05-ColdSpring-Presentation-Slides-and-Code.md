I've embedded the <a href="http://www.slidesix.com">SlideSix</a> version of my ColdSpring presentation from yesterday. This does <b>not</b> include the recording URL. I am working on that. When I get it working, I'll edit it at SlideSix and will not update this entry (but I may post a comment). Enjoy - and sorry for the delay. Don't forget - you can download the code by clicking the Menu button.
