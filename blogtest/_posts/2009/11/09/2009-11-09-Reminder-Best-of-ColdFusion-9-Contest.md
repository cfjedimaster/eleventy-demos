Just a reminder, but do not forget to work on your entry to the <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2009/10/23/Announcement-Best-of-ColdFusion-9-Contest">Best of ColdFusion 9</a> contest. The deadline is November 30th, a mere 21 days away, and with the prizes we have, you have absolutely no reason <b>not</b> to enter. Everyone who enters gets something. That's far better odds then you'll get in the lottery. Anyone out there brave enough to share a hint about what they have planned?
