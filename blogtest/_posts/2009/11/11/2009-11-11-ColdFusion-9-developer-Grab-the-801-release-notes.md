Last week I wrote a <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2009/11/4/Checking-for-updates-to-tagsfunctions-in-ColdFusion-9">quick blog entry</a> discussing how one could determine what changed between ColdFusion 8 and 9. This was specifically focused on low level language stuff, like abort being added to CFDUMP, etc. I discovered today, much to my dismay, that it looks like we have one more place to check... the 8.0.1. release notes. For some reason, some of the updates in 8.0.1 are missing from the ColdFusion 9 docs. I found three specific examples: ColdFusion.Window.destroy, ColdFusion.Window.create (new option for configuration), and ColdFusion.RichText.getEditorObject(). There may be more - but I just wanted to put this on people's radar. 

You can download the release notes here: <a href="http://www.adobe.com/support/documentation/en/coldfusion/releasenotes.html#801">http://www.adobe.com/support/documentation/en/coldfusion/releasenotes.html#801</a>
