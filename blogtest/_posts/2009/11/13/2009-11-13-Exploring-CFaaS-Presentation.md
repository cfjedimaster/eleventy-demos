Hey folks - here are the slides and code from my Exploring ColdFusion as a Service presentation at RIAUnleashed. Please note that these slides and code deserve some explanation. I plan on doing a series of blog posts on CFaaS over the next few days to help others learn about this new ColdFusion 9 feature.

	<param name="menu" value="false"/>
	<param name="scale" value="noScale"/>
	<param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"/>
	<param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always" />

</object>

This code comes with a license requirement that you don't laugh at my Flex code.
