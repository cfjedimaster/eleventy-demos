I got home from Boston last night after attending <a href="http://www.riaunleashed.com">RIAUnleashed</a>. I want to thank Brian Rinaldi for asking me to speak there. He ran a <b>tremendous</b> conference. One day - densely packed - and a great combination of server side and client side sessions. I'd highly recommend folks attend next year. I know that not everyone can afford the money and time for the "big" conferences, so you should definitely consider RIAUnleashed. If any of the attendees read this blog, I'd love to hear your feelings as well.
