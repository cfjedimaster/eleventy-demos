Tomorrow I'll be giving my "Introduction to ColdFusion ORM" presentation to the Online ColdFusion Meetup. For more details, and to RSVP (please RSVP, it inflates my already prodigious ego into even greater sizes) please see the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/coldfusionmeetup/calendar/11862947/">meetup page</a>. It will be held online - for free (as always!) at 11AM CST. This is a repeat of the session I gave at MAX, so if you can't make it, you can always watch it on Adobe TV: <a href="http://tv.adobe.com/watch/max-2009-develop/introduction-to-coldfusion-orm">http://tv.adobe.com/watch/max-2009-develop/introduction-to-coldfusion-orm</a> One difference with tomorrows meeting however is that I'll have more time. There were demos I didn't quite have time to cover and I had to skimp a bit on the relationship side. As always this one will be recorded for later viewing.
