For those who couldn't make my ColdFusion 9 ORM presentation today, Charlie Arehart has posted the recording:<br/>

As I mentioned in the presentation, the slides (for the most part) and code are the same from the MAX presentation. I was able to go a lot longer and show a lot more, but resource wise, everything is the same. Therefore, I'm linking to my previous SlideSix upload below.<br/>
