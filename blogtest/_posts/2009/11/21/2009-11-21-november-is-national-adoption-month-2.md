Every year I promise to blog this on the 1st, and every year it gets away from me. Personally, I think Time is an evil thief who must be killed at the earliest convenience, but maybe it's just me getting old. In case you weren't aware, November is national adoption month. You can read the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/presidential-proclamations-national-adoption-month">presidential proclomation</a> here if you are interested. I'll also pass along this nice list of <a href="https://www.childwelfare.gov/">highlights</a> for the month (notice the CFM extension - and yes - it is a Model-Glue site).

Regular readers know that my wife and I chose adoption as the way to grow our family. We have three beautiful kids from South Korea. Adoption is a very special, very emotional, and very wonderful thing. If you have any questions I'd highly encourage you to ask - either myself or someone local to you. 

I'll leave you with two small pieces of advice when it comes to talking to families who have adopted. First - don't ask about the "real" parents. I hate to be PC, but this is one thing that really ticks me off, as it does most adoptive parents. Obviously the person raising the child is the real parent. It's best to refer to the birth parents as the biological parents (or birth parents). Secondly - don't ask something you aren't willing to answer yourself. I've had folks ask how much I paid for my kids (yes, seriously, and to be clear, you pay for paperwork and handling, not children), ask if they are related, and ask if they knew they were adopted (gee, my kids aren't blind, and I'm a bit pale compared to them ;). Just keep it in mind. Questions about processes, wait times, how to <i>manage</i> costs, etc are fine. 

Obviously I speak just for myself and not all adoptive parents.
