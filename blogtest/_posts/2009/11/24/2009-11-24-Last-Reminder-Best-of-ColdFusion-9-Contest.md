As Thanksgiving approaches, I'll remind people that coding is an excellent way to burn off calories (seriously!). Do not forget that you still have time to work on a submission for the <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2009/11/9/Reminder--Best-of-ColdFusion-9-Contest">Best of ColdFusion 9</a> contest. This is open to everyone. You can (and have been able to for a while) download ColdFusion 9 and begin cranking away at a demo now. It need not be a large framework or application. It can be a simple one page sample of a cool feature. It can be anything. But at minimum, it has to be turned in by the end of the month. So get cracking folks!
