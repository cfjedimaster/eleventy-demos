As I <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2009/11/19/Quick-Tip--CFLOG-and-JSON">mentioned</a> a few days ago, I'm a huge fan of using CFLOG for debugging. To go along with that I make heavy use of TailView in ColdFusion Builder. TailView "monitors" a log file. Every time the file is updated it will automatically show the new lines. This is much easier than using the log viewer built into the ColdFusion Administrator. One of the cooler features of TailView, and something that may not be obvious, is that you can apply filters based on search criteria. This can make certain log lines stick out more than others. Here is a quick video demonstration.
