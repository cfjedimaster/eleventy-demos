A new cumulative hot fix for ColdFusion 8.0.1 has been released. This is number four. Details and download may be found here: <a href="http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/529/cpsid_52915.html">http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/529/cpsid_52915.html</a>

You may remember that the last CHF fix <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2009/9/3/Cumulative-Hot-Fix-3-did-NOT-include-security-updates?adminview=true">did <b>not</b></a> include security fixes. Oddly, this one includes two fixes. However, I have to ask (and will post back if I hear an answer) what the official word on is this. I was told last time that it was <b>not</b> policy to include security fixes in CHF. So was that policy changed? Are all the security fixes in this one or only some? Is a user "safe" if they install a virgin CF8 and then apply this CHF?
