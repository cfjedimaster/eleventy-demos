I almost always use Flex Builder to edit Flex code, but when I double click on a file to quickly look at it, my Mac displays it with TextMate. I asked on Twitter today about Flex/AS color coding support for TextMate and Jeff Self came to my rescue. This <a href="http://mswallace.com/2007/07/30/installing-as3-and-flex-bundle-for-textmate/">blog post</a> tells you how to get the bundles and it works great, <b>except</b> that the URLs used for SVN are out of date. 

Replace

http://macromates.com/svn/Bundles/trunk/Review/Bundles/Flex.tmbundle

with

http://svn.textmate.org/trunk/Review/Bundles/Flex.tmbundle/

and replace

http://macromates.com/svn/Bundles/trunk/Review/Bundles/ActionScript\ 3.tmbundle

with

http://svn.textmate.org/trunk/Review/Bundles/ActionScript 3.tmbundle/
