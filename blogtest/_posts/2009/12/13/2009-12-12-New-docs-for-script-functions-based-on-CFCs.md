Part of the improvements in ColdFusion 9 involve the ability to use various CF tags in script. Sometimes this is done by the use of a new keyword. So for example, writeDump and writeLog. Other tags were implemented as CFCs, such as Query and Mail. It can be a bit difficult to find explanations for how to use these new guys. I noticed yesterday that on Livedocs, there is a new section just for these new components: <a href="http://help.adobe.com/en_US/ColdFusion/9.0/CFMLRef/WSe9cbe5cf462523a0693d5dae123bcd28f6d-8000.html">Script Functions Implemented as CFCs</a>. This is the first time I can remember seeing Livedocs have pages not contained within the PDF download.
