The 3rd public beta of ColdFusion Builder has been <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/coldfusionbuilder/">released</a> to the Labs. Go grab it now. ColdFusion Builder has been my primary IDE for a few months now and I've been <i>very</i> happy with its progress. Some darn nifty things are in this new beta, including ORM hinting, a SQL editor(*), extensions updates, and support for building AIR applications. Check the <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/ColdFusion_Builder">release notes</a> for more information. 

For those who have suffered with performance issues with CFB - definitely give this one a try. It's performing a heck of a lot better than earlier editions and even includes a way to turn on <i>additional</i> performance optimizations with one click.

* So the SQL editor is a nice update, but it only applies to editing SQL from within a document. If you use the "old" way of writing/testing SQL via the RDS panel, you get the old editor. No color coding and no hinting.
