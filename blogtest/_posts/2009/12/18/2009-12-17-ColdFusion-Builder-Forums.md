Have a question about the new ColdFusion Builder beta? Want to help others learn how to use ColdFusion Builder? Be sure to visit the Lab's forums setup just for ColdFusion Builder:

<a href="http://forums.adobe.com/community/labs/coldfusionbuilder/">ColdFusion Builder Forums</a>

I know not everyone is interested in setting up a blog, but support forums like this are a great way for people to share knowledge and help others.
