Please note what follows is an especially personal, especially rambling, look back at 2009. I don't think this blog entry will be useful to anyone but me, so be warned before reading any further!

As 2009 comes to a close, I have to say that it was a "pretty good" year. Not great, but not horrible either. As I hear more and more people on Twitter say that 2009 wasn't so hot but they are hopeful for 2010, I have to say that isn't the case for me. 2009 had it's bad spots for sure, but overall, I'm pretty satisfied.

On the work front, I began the year at Broadchoice, working hard on Workspace, an AIR/Flex/Groovy/Hibernate/Spring project. Things ended at Broadchoice in April, and not in a great way, but <i>before</i> then I had the opportunity to learn a heck of a lot. Thats much more invaluable then any one job. One of my <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2009/1/1/My-New-Years-Resolutions">resolutions</a> for the year had been to become an "intermediate Flex" developer, and while that is somewhat of a vague term, I think I'm finally there. 

After Broadchoice came to an end, I did a lot of contracting (and thank you to those of you who hooked me up). I began doing consulting for <a href="http://www.firstcomp.com">FirstComp</a> after CFUNITED. For those who don't know, that's the company Jason Delmore ended up after Adobe. I'm happy to say that as of Monday of this week, I'm now a full time, "real" employee of FirstComp. While I never hurt for work (not looking forward to the tax bill this year), I"m happy to have a stable full time gig with one company. There are a lot of really nice, smart folks at FirstComp. Before meeting them I had no idea how big their ColdFusion implementation was and how much they had invested in it for their business. I also got to meet <a href="http://www.imagetrend.com/">ImageTrend</a>. They do consulting with FirstComp as well and are probably the largest ColdFusion shop you have never heard of. Lots of a smart guys (and gals!) there and I hope they get more exposure. They deserve it!

One resolution I did not mention was in regards to speaking. I felt like I had gotten into a "presentation rut" in 2008 and earlier, giving the same presentation over and over again. I decided that in 2009 I'd do my best to give all new, all fresh presentations. (I made an exception for the Online Meetup, where I was able to give presentations for free that I had earlier given at conferences.) This was a great decision. I gave new presentations on ORM, ColdSpring, Model-Glue, charting, and other topics. It was stressful, but fun. I'm going to try to keep it up for 2010 as well. I've submitted a topic to on <a href="http://fw1.riaforge.org">FW/1</a> to cfObjective. If I'm not chosen to speak (not holding my breath this year), then I'll give it to the online meetup. I'm no FW/1 expert, but I plan to use it a lot more in 2010. While Model-Glue continues to be my favorite framework, FW/1 is damn skippy and comes in a close second for me. In a similar vein, I've fallen behind in my Flex skills recently. I want to spend some time researching <a href="http://swizframework.org/">Swiz</a>. What better way to learn it then to force myself to present on it? I used Swiz back at Broadchoice, and it <i>really</i> helped me with what I considered to be my biggest issue with Flex - complexity. 

This was the year I finally embraced Twitter. I'm still not exactly sure how useful it is - but not everything has to have a vital purpose, does it? And I'll be brutally honest, 2000+ followers does wonders for my already overblown ego. And while I'm on the topic of ego, it was very humbling to take home multiple community awards from <a href="http://www.cfunited.com">CFUNITED</a> this year. It's nice to see the community grow and expand. I'm adding new blogs to <a href="http://www.coldfusionbloggers.org">ColdFusion Bloggers</a> every week. I hope more people decide to share their knowledge and experience in 2010. I know it's scary - but at the end of the day - we can all learn from one another.

This was also the year I pretty much stopped using <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/spry/">Spry</a>. I've taken the <a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a> koolaid and am quite addicted. While I recommend jQuery to everyone with ears, I still have a lot of respect for Spry. It was my gateway drug to Ajax in general and is still, in my opinion, the best framework for non-technical folks or people who want a gentler introduction to Ajax development.

Oh, and Adobe released another ColdFusion. And it kicked ass. I'm still shocked at how fast ColdFusion 9 runs, and ORM has redefined application development for me. I've said in the past that ColdFusion is so RAD I could probably do more with version 4 then a PHP dev could do with their latest version. While I still think that (warning, I may be biased), I can't imagine going back to <i>any</i> earlier version of ColdFusion. That - to me - is how radically improved version 9 is. It's truly a high point in the history of the product. And yea, I'm biased as hell (hope to get my ColdFusion tattoo sometime soon), but that's what I think.

On a negative side, I discovered one aspect of my personality that I'm not happy about. I'm negative. I don't know if I come off as negative on the blog, or Twitter, and it may have just been temporary, but when things got bad at Broadchoice, I got unhappy (nothing wrong with that) and I don't think I handled it very well. Ok, I'll admit it - I think I handled it like crap. I think when things get rough, I can get into a mood that is just hard to shake off. I'm <i>really</i> happy I recognized that. I won't kid myself into thinking that I'll <i>stop</i> being so negative, but at least knowing I do gives me perspective. It's something I'm going to watch out for in the future.

So I'll wrap this now. I'm probably going to do a post tomorrow as well with more specific resolutions, it just depends on how crazy things get tonight. I want to say one last, very important thing.

<h1>Thank You</h1>

I want to thank everyone who reads this blog. I want to thank everyone who comes to my presentations. Thank you for your feedback. Thank you for your participation. I love code. I love talking about code. And without you guys, I'd be talking to myself, which is only slightly more weird for me than normal. I hope you guys stick around for 2010. I'd lie and say there will be less OT posts, less Star Wars jokes, and less rants, but, well, I think everyone here knows better.
