Nothing too critical to report here, but I noticed for the first time last night that ColdFusion 9 now groups scheduled tasks in the Administrator. Each task is grouped by whether it is a one time, daily, or daily every task.

Outside of new settings, are there any other changes people have noticed? The only other one that comes to mind is the new "Save to PDF" option on the Settings Summary.
