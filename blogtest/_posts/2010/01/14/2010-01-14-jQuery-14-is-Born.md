More information can be found at the <a href="http://jquery14.com/day-01/jquery-14">jQuery14</a> site. That link also includes a nice overview (with pretty charts!) of some of the updates. Oh, and Google is already offering a CDN version as well. 

So - who is going to take this opportunity to jump upon the jQuery bandwagon??
