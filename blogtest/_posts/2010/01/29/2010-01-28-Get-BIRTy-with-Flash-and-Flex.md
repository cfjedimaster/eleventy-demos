I am not familiar (at all) with BIRT, but I wanted to pass on their announcement of a new contest for Flash and Flex developers. The <a href="http://www.birt-exchange.com/be/news-events/adobe-contest/?articleid=18554">Get BIRT-y with Flash and Flex</a> contest is open now till March 10 and has a nice (and large) cash prize of up to $5,000 for the winner. From my (seriously) 30 second glimpse, it looks like BIRT involves visualization and is open source, so it may be something for Flex folks to take  a look at anyway (and if any of you guys have experience with BIRT, post a quick comment).
