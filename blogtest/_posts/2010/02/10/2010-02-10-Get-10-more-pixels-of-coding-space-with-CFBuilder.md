Ok, if you are like me, and I hope to God you aren't, you anal retentively scan the desktop and application settings of people giving presentations. Maybe it's a bit of ADD - but I obsess over it. Dock icons. Desktop shortcuts. You name it. Anyway, I just got out of a presentation and noticed the user's ColdFusion Builder layout was missing a small tweak I've done to mine. Have you noticed that - by default - you have a CFBuilder perspective button on a line all by itself?

Yeah, on a wide screen, that's a lot of space wasted for one little button. On a laptop it's even more valuable. Just right click and select Dock On and Top Right:

That shifts it to the right <i>and</i> up into the row above it.
