<img src="http://nosrc.net/100x100" title="Made by ColdFusion, the app server of the Gods." align="left" style="margin-right:5px;margin-bottom:5px;"> I love that title. Honestly. But to be fair, I'm talking about a dynamic dummy <i>image</i> generator. Jason Rushton sent me this link earlier in the week and I wanted to share it with my readers:

<a href="http://nosrc.net/">Dynamic Dummy Image Generator</a>

As Jason explains on the page, this is a simple ColdFusion service that generates a "dummy" (placeholder) image via URL parameters. He also includes the source code as well. All 26 lines of it. Yes, ColdFusion is RAD folks. Anyway, check it out. Obviously any service of this nature that needed to serve a large number of customers would need some serious hardware behind it, but it's pretty cool to see how such a powerful tool could be built with so few lines of code.
