Just helping to spread the word - a new ColdFusion Security Bulletin was released today:

<a href="http://www.adobe.com/support/security/bulletins/apsb10-05.html">Security update for BlazeDS</a>

I wish Adobe had an email system where folks could be emailed on all updates like this. Expecting folks to follow Twitter/Blogs/check Adobe.com daily is a bit much.

Of course, since I <i>wrote</i> that I thought I'd check, and yes, there seems to be a <a href="http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/entitlement/index.cfm?e=szalert">security notification service</a>. 

There is an RSS feed (found <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/psirt/atom.xml">here</a>) but I think email is much better for stuff like this. I've signed up and will report back on how well it works. (I assume I won't get a notice for the item just released.)

My dream would be that the CF Admin would have a nice large flashing red icon when security releases are announced.
