<img src="https://static.raymondcamden.com/images/cfjedi/ncdevcon-logo-sm.png" align="left" style="margin-right: 5px" title="NCDevCon - coolest conference held in this galaxy!" /> I don't think I've blogged this yet but a blog entry from Dan Wilson earlier today reminded me I needed to mention it. Dan, and others, are running a <b>100% free</b> ColdFusion/Flex/AIR/etc conference in North Carolina. <a href="http://www.ncdevcon.com/">NCDevCon</a> will be held May 22-23rd at the campus of North Carolina State University in Raleigh, NC. I missed last year's CFinNC, and unfortunately I'll be missing this one (speaking at SOTR), but I've heard nothing but praise about CFinNC, and heck, you can't beat free.

I wanted to specifically mention this today though because of the <a href="http://www.nodans.com/index.cfm/2010/3/15/Why-you-should-submit-beginnerintermediate-sessions-to-NCDevCon">blog entry</a> Dan wrote earlier today. The conference is getting quite a bit of interest from folks who are new to ColdFusion, but the majority of speaker submissions are on advanced topics. NCDevCon is in need of speakers who can cover introductory/basic ColdFusion topics. Folks, if you are in the area and can make it, <b>it is time to step up</b> and help spread the ColdFusion gospel to the uninitiated! Anyone, with patience and practice, can do a basic presentation.
