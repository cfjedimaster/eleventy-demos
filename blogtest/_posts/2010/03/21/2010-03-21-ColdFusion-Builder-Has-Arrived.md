It looks like Adobe's newest product, ColdFusion Builder, has officially arrived. I'm seeing it highlighted <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion/?promoid=FCRSO">here</a> along with ColdFusion. You can download the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/tdrc/index.cfm?product=coldfusion_builder">trial</a> here (note, that link will probably require you to register/sign in first). 

And now for the million dollar question - the cost. If you go <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion/buy/#cfb">here</a> you can now buy ColdFusion Builder for US 299. That high? I don't think so. I think that price is awesome, but it gets even better. You also get a copy of <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/buy/">Flash Builder 4</a> as well. That is an <b>amazing</b> combo and and an <b>amazing</b> price. I've been using CFBuilder daily for a few months now and I can easily say it's worth that price. It has been a great boon to my development. It certainly had some ... rough spots (grin) during it's development. Those of you who suffered with performance issues in the last beta can attest to that. Trust me when I say that more recent builds have been significantly better. Please update to the latest trial and get it a shot.

I'm also proud to say that I'll be part of the CFBuilder tour that is starting this week. I'll be flying to East Lansing, MI on Tuesday to give a presentation. In preparation for this trip I've discovered even more cool things that I had missed in my earlier testing. I'm pretty darn excited and can't wait to share that with others. 

I've mentioned this before, but I'll also be presenting on CFBuilder at <a href="http://www.scotch-on-the-rocks.co.uk/">Scotch on the Rocks</a> in a few weeks - specifically on extension development. 

So - what do people think? Be honest? Are you excited about this? If not, what is holding you back? What are you looking forward to and what worries you? Are there parts of CFBuilder that you specifically want to see more blog entries from me on?
