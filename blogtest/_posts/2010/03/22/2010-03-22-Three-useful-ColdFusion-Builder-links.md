So as I've said before - I sometimes have trouble finding things on Adobe.com. If you're like me, hopefully the following two links will help:

<a href="http://help.adobe.com/en_US/ColdFusionBuilder/Installing/index.html">Installing ColdFusion Builder</a> (Online)<br/>
<a href="http://help.adobe.com/en_US/ColdFusionBuilder/Installing/cfbuilder_install.pdf">Installing ColdFusion Builder</a> (PDF)<br/>
<a href="http://help.adobe.com/en_US/ColdFusionBuilder/Using/index.html">Using ColdFusion Builder</a> (Online)<br/>
<a href="http://help.adobe.com/en_US/ColdFusionBuilder/Using/cfbuilder_help.pdf">Using ColdFusion Builder</a> (PDF)<br/>

And finally, I want to share a graphic Adam Lehman posted earlier. It's a competitive brief of ColdFusion Builder, Dreaweaver, HomeSite+, and CFEclipse. Click the shrunken image to enlarge.

3 links? Think I was a bit off on that. :)

<b>Edit at 3:49PM:</b> And yet another link - the CFBuilder Forums may be found here: <a href="http://forums.adobe.com/community/coldfusion/coldfusionbuilder">http://forums.adobe.com/community/coldfusion/coldfusionbuilder</a>
