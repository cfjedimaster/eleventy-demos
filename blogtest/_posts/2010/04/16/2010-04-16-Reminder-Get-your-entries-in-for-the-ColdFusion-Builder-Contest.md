<img src="https://static.raymondcamden.com/images/cfjedi/cf_builder_appicon.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right:5px" title="ColdFusion Builder FTW!" /> Just a quick reminder that you still have time to enter the <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2010/3/22/ColdFusion-Builder-Contest">ColdFusion Builder</a> contest. This is an excellent chance to try your hand at extending CFBuilder or just helping others use it. The official deadline is April 22nd but if folks need, I can extend this to the end of the month. (As it stands, I know I'll be busy with <a href="http://www.cfobjective.com">cfObjective</a> next week!)
