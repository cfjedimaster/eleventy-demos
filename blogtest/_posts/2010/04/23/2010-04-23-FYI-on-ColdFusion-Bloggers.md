A <i>long</i> time ago I added some additional functionality for registered users. This allowed them to get daily emails on the top entries, or even get a list of all entries, that were added to the aggregator that day. I also added keyword matching. So being that I'm an ego addict, I have a term match for "camden". This runs all day so that when an entry is aggregated with my name in it, I get an email.

For a little while now the UI controls for login and registration have been a bit borked. I finally got them all converted to 100% jQuery and jQuery UI so they all should work fine now. If any of the above features sound interesting to you, check it out.
