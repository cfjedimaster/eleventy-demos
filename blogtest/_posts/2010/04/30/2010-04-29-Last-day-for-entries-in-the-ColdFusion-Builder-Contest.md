<img src="https://static.raymondcamden.com/images/cfjedi/cf_builder_appicon.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right:5px" title="ColdFusion Builder FTW!" /> Just a quick reminder that today is the last day to enter the <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2010/3/22/ColdFusion-Builder-Contest">ColdFusion Builder Contest</a>. Get your submissions to me by 23:59:59 CST (ColdFusion Standard Time) in order to enter. I've only got a few entries so far, so please make time to participate if you want a chance to win fame and fortune. (Ok, more fame than fortune.) The entries I've got so far are great, but I hope to see a few more come in later today.
