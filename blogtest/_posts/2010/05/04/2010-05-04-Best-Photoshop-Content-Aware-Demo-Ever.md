Take one broken image:

And then fix it in Photoshop CS5:

Problem solved. May the Fourth be with you.

p.s. Ok, just to make it clear, I'm a complete and utter Photoshop noob. This could have been done <i>much</i> cleaner. But considering the fact that I did this in 5 minutes as a newbie - I think it says a lot. :)
