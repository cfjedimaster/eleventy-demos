Pardon the brief, probably overly dramatic title, but I wanted to get your attention. ColdFusion Community member Aaron West is one of many people suffering with due to the Nashville flooding. A Paypal donation site has been set up to help him out: <a href="http://friendsforaaron.blogspot.com/">http://friendsforaaron.blogspot.com/</a> This is 100% legit. If you've been a user of any of my open source stuff and have been looking to visit my wishlist, I'd urge you to send a donation to help Aaron and his family out. They are close to half way to their goal of 5K. Please give what you can!

And yes - the blue arrow is his house:
