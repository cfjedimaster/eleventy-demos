I'm upgrading my desktop soon (a MacPro from close to 3 years ago) and I'm going to switch to PC. I won't go into why - and I'll be the first to admit I might go right back (or switch to Ubuntu), but I'd like to get some opinions on the two systems below. The HP has more bling and is cheaper. But I was a Dell customer for a <i>long</i> time and their support kicks butt. I can remember every hardware issue I had being corrected - in person - within 48 hours or so. So I'm tempted to do Dell even though the system is a bit pricier and doesn't have the BluRay or 2TB drive. Anyway, I'm sure everyone will have one opinion only and will make this easy for me. 

First the Dell...

And then the HP...

The price for the HP is 2498.
