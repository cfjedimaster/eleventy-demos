I just released a minor update to <a href="http://galleon.riaforge.org">Galleon</a>, my ColdFusion Forums product. The updates include:

<ul>
<li>You can now link to an attachment from within a post. So for example: [attachment]Download[/attachment] will create a link to your attachment with the text Download. You can also do: [attachment]Me[/attachment] and if the attachment is a picture, it will automatically be displayed within the post with the inner text used for the title attribute. Using the attachment tag does not remove the attachment link, it just provides another way for folks to get the attachment.</li>
<li>Removed the old code formatter and replaced it with <a href="http://coldfish.riaforge.org">ColdFish</a>. This is the same formatter <a href="http://www.blogcfc.com">BlogCFC</a> uses.</li>
<li> Miscellaneous bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
