Recently the security firm <a href="http://www.procheckup.com">Procheckup</a> performed a security scan on <a href="http://www.blogcfc.com">BlogCFC</a>. This was for a customer of theirs but they gladly shared the issues they found. This was rather nice of them so I'd like to thank them. They not only sent me a very detailed list of the issues (XSS issues), but also worked to help me verify they were fixed.
