Looks like I'm the last one to blog (my fault for actually trying to sleep last night ;) that the first update to ColdFusion Builder has been released. This <a href="http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/846/cpsid_84607.html">note</a> describes how and what is it fixed. Probably the number one thing corrected is the "long horizontal line" issue. If you had any code that was <i>real</i> long and you tried to type at the end, CFB would "flip" back and forth. It drove me batty and I'm happy to see it corrected. Another nice fix involves an issue I ran into all the time with JavaScript and Code Assist. Anyway, if you are a CFBuilder user, update now!
