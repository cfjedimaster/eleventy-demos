Just a quick note that I'll be giving a presentation tomorrow to the online meetup: <a href="http://www.meetup.com/coldfusionmeetup/calendar/13726129/">Beginning SQLite Database Development for AIR</a>. This is a repeat of the presentation I gave at cfObjective this year. It begins promptly at 11:00 AM CST. Be sure to check the live demonstration of the amazing Unicorn demo.
