This morning I got an email from RIAForge's host saying that a hardware failure had brought down the site. Unfortunately, they didn't have my contact number (well, to be honest, I was enjoying my sleep - I love RIAForge but I don't promise 99.999 uptime ;) so I just now found this all out. I've sent them some info they need, but I will probably <i>not</i> be online much today. Worse case I'd say the server will be restored tomorrow. The host has database backups and I have my own backup from Wednesday so I don't think we will lose anything. I apologize for the this and will post again when the site is restored.

Oh, and happy Father's Day to all the dads out there!
