The title says it all. It was actually restored yesterday morning - but as I was in and out all day yesterday I didn't get a chance to blog about the update. I want to give a huge shout out to <a href="http://www.hosting.com/">Hosting.com</a> for their <i>extremely</i> quick response on this issue. If you are a RIAForge user (not a project admin, I've got a separate email for yall coming in a second) and you added content to the site after midnight Sunday morning (like a bug report for example), you will want to check to see if your content has been restored.
