<img src="https://static.raymondcamden.com/images/cfjedi/Capture.PNG" align="left" style="margin-right:5px" /> Just got word that <a href="http://dzone.com">DZone</a> has released a new ColdFusion Ref Card: <a href="http://refcardz.dzone.com/refcardz/leveraging-coldfusion-9?oid=hom24471">Leveraging ColdFusion 9 Exposed Services from Java</a>. This reference was written by JavaLoader/Transfer/UberCFer Mark Mandel. I was a bit confused by what they meant by "Exposed Services", but it's simply another way to refer to CFaaS (ColdFusion as a Service). While you have to register for DZone, the actual reference guide itself is absolutely free. Don't forget you can also get a <a href="http://refcardz.dzone.com/refcardz/getting-started-adobe?oid=hom19601">CFBuilder Ref Card</a> as well.
