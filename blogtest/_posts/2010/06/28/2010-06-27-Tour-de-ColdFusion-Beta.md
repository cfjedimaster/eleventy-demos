This is an AIR based application which gives you examples of all ColdFusion tags and functions. You get both sample code and output as well. It is very much a work in progress (hey, that's what the Beta is for!), but you are encouraged to download it and try it out. Feedback can be given on the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/tourdecoldfusion">public Google group</a>. I helped out a bit on this project (mainly review, although I wrote some of the samples a bit) and I think it is off to a great start. Being able to actually <i>see</i> the result of a feature I think makes a big difference.
