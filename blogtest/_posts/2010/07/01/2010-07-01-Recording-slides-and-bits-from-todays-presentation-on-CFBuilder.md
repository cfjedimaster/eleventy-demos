Downloadable versions are coming soon - check <a href="http://www.meetup.com/coldfusionmeetup/pages/Recordings_of_the_ColdFusion_Meetup-2010/">here</a> later today. (Well, I'm not sure when Charlie posts the downloadable ones - but they aren't there quite yet.)

The embed below has a slightly different slide deck, but all the code is attached to it though. Please let me know if you have any questions.
