I don't normally blog about every little update to my open source applications, but I thought I'd point out an update to <a href="http://lighthousepro.riaforge.org">Lighthouse Pro</a> that I just released. Along with some bug fixes (thanks to Lincoln Milner), I finally added issue defaults for projects. What this means is you can specify a default project area, severity, status, and issue type at the project level. Any new issue will use these defaults. This <i>also</i> applies to issues created via email. 

As always - any feedback or suggestions for LHP are welcome.
