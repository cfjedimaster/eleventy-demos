A <b>huge</b> thank you to Tim Cunningham for posting a recording of my CFUNITED presentation on Adobe AIR, HTML applications, and jQuery. You can find it here:

And of course, even if you have no interest in watching the video, you must at last gaze upon the second most freaky picture of me ever:

I do plan on pinging Charlie Arehart soon and giving this presentation for the Online Meetup.
