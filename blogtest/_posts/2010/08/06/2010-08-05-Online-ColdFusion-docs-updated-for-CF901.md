Not a huge big deal, but it's Friday and I'm easily amused. The <a href="http://help.adobe.com/en_US/ColdFusion/9.0/CFMLRef/index.html">online ColdFusion reference</a> has been updated for version 9.0.1. It also says this in the little yellow sticky note on the right. This is still a work in progress (all of the new JavaScript APIs are missing and I see that cfgrid was updated with the initshow argument), but the process has begun. One of my complaints about the 801 release was that the main docs were never updated. Therefore it was easy to forget about some of the changes. (I know I did all the time.) This is a good sign, even if not yet quite complete.
