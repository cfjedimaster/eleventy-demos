Git (home page <a href="http://git-scm.com/">here</a>), is extremely popular these days in our community. I got a chance to learn about it from Simeon Bateman at this year's cfObjective. I also read about it an excellent book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1430218339?ie=UTF8&tag=raymondcamden-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1430218339">Pro Git</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=raymondcamden-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1430218339" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> (affiliate link). If you are interested in learning about it yourself, I wanted to point out that on Thursday, at noon (EST), Tim Cunningham will be giving a presentation to the ColdFusion Online Meetup entitled: <a href="http://www.meetup.com/coldfusionmeetup/calendar/14438544/">GIT for Dummies and the slightly more enlightened</a>. I've got to say I'm quite enamored with Git now and am using it for new projects. This is an excellent opportunity to learn about Git and why so many developers are talking about it. 

p.s. I'll also say that Tim makes a kick butt beer. Anyone who brews beer as good as he does has to be a good presenter!
