Ok, so I hate to say that <i>any</i> part of ColdFusion is less than perfect. I will not deny being an unabashed, Kool-aid drinking ColdFusion Fan Boy of the Nth level. That being said - there is one feature that - while I used to like it - I strongly recommend against: Flash Forms. I was a big fan of it, in fact, my <a href="http://harlan.riaforge.org/">Harlan open source ad server</a> makes use of it. But as a feature - it is a dead end. Flash Forms have not been updated in quite some time, and since you can now develop Flex applications for free (remember it's just the IDE you pay for, if you want it), it is really a mistake to do any new development with it. 

Want Flash-based forms? Use Flex. Don't use Flash Forms. Just. Don't.
