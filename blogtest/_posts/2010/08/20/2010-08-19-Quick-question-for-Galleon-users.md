Do you use <a href="http://galleon.riaforge.org">Galleon</a>? If so - would you be interested if added localization support like BlogCFC? Secondly - I'd also just love to hear about where/how you use Galleon - so consider this a request for two things: 1) Where you use Galleon and 2) would localization be something you would like.

I'll point out - BlogCFC only supports English directly. If you want to localize to your language you have to edit the resource bundle file. So it still involves translation work for you - but it's not coding.
