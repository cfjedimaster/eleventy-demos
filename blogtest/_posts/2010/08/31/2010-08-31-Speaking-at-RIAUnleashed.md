Trust me." /> Brian Rinaldi has updated the schedule for this years <a href="http://www.riaunleashed.com/">RIAUnleashed</a> conference. The line up looks incredible. You've got a great <a href="http://www.riaunleashed.com/page.cfm/speakers">list of speakers</a> along with a great <a href="http://www.riaunleashed.com/page.cfm/topics">list of sessions</a>. My topic is on ColdFusion and Solr integration, with the catchy title of <a href="http://www.riaunleashed.com/page.cfm/topics/coldfusion-solr-and-killer-robots">ColdFusion, Solr, and Killer Robots</a>. After my impromptu session on Solr at this year's CFUNITED, I thought it would be nice to do something a bit more formal. I'm also going to be creating a real (if small) application to demonstrate how effective Solr can be for your web site. I highly encourage folks to <a href="http://www.riaunleashed.com/page.cfm/register">register today</a> for the early bird price. Last year's conference was great and I think this one will be even better.
