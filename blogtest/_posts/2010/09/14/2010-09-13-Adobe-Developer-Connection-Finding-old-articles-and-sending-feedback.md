A few days back the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet.html">Adobe Developer Connection</a> relaunched with a polished UI and updated content. I tweeted back then that I thought the ADC was one of the least utilized resources in the Adobe community. It is a treasure trove of articles on all Adobe products. I've found it <b>especially</b> useful for AIR content. Anyway - I recently ran into an issue where I couldn't find one of the older articles. I spoke to Adobian Ed Sullivan about it and he offered up two tips:

1) To find older content, use the archive: <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet-archive/">http://www.adobe.com/devnet-archive/</a>

2) If you find a mistake, problem, etc, you can bypass the normal "Contact Adobe" link at the bottom and use this SurveyMonkey form to let Ed and Adobe know: <a href="http://bit.ly/av8QCk">http://bit.ly/av8QCk</a> Please note - using this form to ask where your copy of "Halo: Reach" is probably will <i>not</i> work well. I tried.
