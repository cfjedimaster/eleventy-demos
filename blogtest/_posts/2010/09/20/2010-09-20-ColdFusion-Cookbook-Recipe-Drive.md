Want some free schwag while helping out the ColdFusion community at the same time? For the month of October, <b>every</b> submission to the <a href="http://cookbooks.adobe.com/coldfusion">ColdFusion Cookbook at Adobe</a> will net you an ADC shirt.  The person who submits the most will get a cool bag and the best submitter will get a copy of ColdFusion Standard. That's a pretty nifty price for helping out your fellow ColdFusion developers. For full details, check out <a href="http://bit.ly/aiEDNQ">Ed's post</a> over on the ADC blog. 

As an added bonus - I will throw in a copy of the CFWACK, version 9, any volume you want, to the person who wins. Get writing!
