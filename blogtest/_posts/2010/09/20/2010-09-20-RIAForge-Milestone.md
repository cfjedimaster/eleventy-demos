Nothing big to report... but.... today <a href="http://www.riaforge.org">RIAForge</a> released the 1000th project. If folks are curious, it is <a href="http://sqldoc.riaforge.org/">SQLDoc</a> by Craig M. Rosenblum. We are also on the way to one million downloads as well. (Currently at 932,754.) 

How many of those projects are <a href="http://www.riaforge.org/index.cfm?event=page.category&id=1">ColdFusion</a>? 760 of em. How many for <a href="http://www.riaforge.org/index.cfm?event=page.category&id=14">ColdFusion Builder</a>? 41. So a bit over 800.

&lt;cf_sarcasm&gt;Don't forget - there are no ColdFusion open source projects.&lt;/cf_sarcasm&gt;
