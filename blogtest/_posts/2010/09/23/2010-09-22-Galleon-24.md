<img src="https://static.raymondcamden.com/images/cfjedi/glogo1.png" title="Galleon FTW" style="align:left;margin-right: 5px" /> I just <a href="http://galleon.riaforge.org">released</a> Galleon 2.4.0 on RIAForge. A minor update, but if fixes some small annoying issues, including cleaning up the email and helping preserve your message entry if your session times out while writing a post. 

<p/>

For anyone not aware - Galleon is an open source, free ColdFusion-based forum solution. It provides all your normal forum-type features as well as plenty of extra cowbell on top.
