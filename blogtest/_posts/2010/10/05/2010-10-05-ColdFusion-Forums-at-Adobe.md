I know the site isn't the best to find stuff at times, but there are a wealth of resources there. Today I was reminded of the <a href="http://forums.adobe.com/community/coldfusion">ColdFusion Forums</a> hosted there. The forums are pretty broad (with <b>11</b> subtopics) and get a bit of traffic.

I knew about these forums for a while but I tended to forget about them. Brian Kotek reminded me today that they <b>support email notifications</b> if you go into one of the sub topics. Simply click the "Receive email notifications" link (after logging in of course) and you can both get emails and reply to them via your email client.
