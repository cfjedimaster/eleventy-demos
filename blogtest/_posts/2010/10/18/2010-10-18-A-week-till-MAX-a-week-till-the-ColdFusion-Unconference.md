<img src="https://static.raymondcamden.com/images/cfjedi/max.png" align="left" style="margin-right: 5px" /> Just a quick reminder that we are one week away from the madness / insanity / awesomeness that is known as <a href="http://max.adobe.com/">Adobe MAX</a>. Along with the great sessions at MAX proper, do not forget about the <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/page.cfm/ColdFusion-Unconference">ColdFusion Unconference</a>. This runs concurrently to MAX and includes some of the biggest names in the industry. It isn't too late to sign up (and remember, you can get a cheaper pass for just the exhibit hall which includes the Unconferences) so sign up now. Logic dictates that you commit now!
