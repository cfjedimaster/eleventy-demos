Let's start with the <b>Good:</b>

<ul>
<li>Absolutely loved the keynote. Kevin Lynch (and a set of guests) did a good job explaining Adobe's vision over a variety of platforms - from desktop to tablets to mobile. It was a great message and one of the fastest keynotes I've seen. (They actually ended early which is a shock.) Some of the demos were incredible: Content Aware Replace on a table - hardware accelerated Flash video. It all looked pretty darn exciting and I can't wait to see more.
<li>AIR was everywhere. I think that AIR, after ColdFusion, is the technology I'm most excited about. We were shown AIR on a template, on a TV, on a phone - pretty much everywhere. I think it's a great sign for the platform. Adobe quoted how many installs of the AIR runtime have been shipping but unfortunately I can't remember the number. It was pretty significant. For more details on AIR related news, see <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/air/2010/10/summary-of-adobe-air-related-announcements-at-max.html">this entry</a>.
<li>If you had told me I would have been enjoyed Martha Stewart at MAX I woulda called you crazy - but wow. Her and Kevin gave a great demo and she seemed like a pretty darn interesting person. 
<li>A whole heck of a lot of software have been dropped on <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/">Labs</a>, including Burrito, the new version of Flash Builder with mobile support. I'll be posting more on this later but it's pretty incredible how easy Adobe made this process. See <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/articles/whatsnew_flashbuilder_burrito.html">this entry</a> for more details.
<li>The first day of the ColdFusion Unconference went spectacular. For many sessions we had standing room only. Great turnout and I hope to see as many people 
<li>Oh yeah - we got a free phone. I won't lie - if you give me stuff, you make happy. I'm easy that way. 
<li>I don't remember her name, but the woman from Motorola said something along the lines of, "If someone gives you a browser without Flash they aren't giving you the whole Internet." Awesome - and I agree completely.
</ul>

And now the <b>bad</b>...

If you follow me on Twitter, you saw that last night my laptop bag (and laptop of course) was stolen. Totally my fault as I walked away from it, but if I was a jerk to anyone today - I apologize. I'm trying to be pragmatic about it. A lot of other things could have happened a lot worse then just having a laptop stolen, but it's pissing me off a bit more as time goes on. I've got a laptop (obviously) now that I'm borrowing so I was able to present. (Thanks Dean Harmon and Charlie Griefer!) Tomorrow will be better, right? Don't forget you can watch the keynotes online live. (See <a href="http://max.adobe.com">max.adobe.com</a>.) I've heard the quality was excellent, and oh yeah - it works on <b>all</b>
