Wow, that was fast. Looks like all the sessions (and keynotes) can now be found on Adobe TV: <a href="http://tv.adobe.com/channel/max/max-2010/">MAX 2010</a>. If you are looking for my presentation, you can find it <a href="http://tv.adobe.com/watch/max-2010-develop/best-practices-of-the-modern-coldfusion-developer/">here</a> (but the downloads are available <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2010/10/29/Slides-from-my-MAX-presentation-Best-Practices-of-the-Modern-ColdFusion-Developer">here</a> on my site - as far as I know I have no way to add downloads to my own presentation on Adobe TV). I missed most of the presentations due to managing the Unconference so this is going to be great for me too!

Thanks for this find go to <a href="http://henrylearnstorock.blogspot.com/2010/10/max-2010-sessions-on-adobe-tv.html">Henry Ho</a>.
