I should have posted this a few days ago, but as I'm still recovering from MAX (and a chocolate binge last night) I hope I can be forgiven for being a bit late. This year's ColdFusion Unconference was - I think - incredible. Sure I'm biased, but I think between the kick ass set of speakers and content along with the large crowds (for most of the time we had people standing outside our zone) that it was our best year yet. My thanks go out to all our speakers as well as to Charlie Griefer and Ezra Parker who worked with me to help manage this thing. Thanks also go to Adobe and the ColdFusion team for supporting this.

For folks looking to download presentations, I've asked speakers to add them to the ColdFusion Unconference group at Slide Six: <a href="http://slidesix.com/group/ColdFusion-Unconference-2010">http://slidesix.com/group/ColdFusion-Unconference-2010</a>. Only a few are up there but hopefully that will change with a bit of gentle prodding from my readers. ;)

If anyone has any suggestions or feedback for next year (assuming Adobe invites us back), please either leave a comment here or use my Contact form. One change we plan on doing is creating a nice 3-4 hour block to talk about frameworks and patterns. Both of these topics had some great discussions but had to be cut short. Next year I'd like to set up a block so we can have a few short presentation along with groups discussions in one block.

Finally, I've got to share this picture from Dave Ferguson:
