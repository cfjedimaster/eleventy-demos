There was <i>quite</i> a bit of news in regards to Adobe AIR and devices (phones, TVs, etc) at this year's MAX conference. With that in mind I thought it might make sense to set up a new place to discuss the topic. I'm a member of the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/air-html-js">HTML/AIR with JS</a> group and have found the discussions there great. The focus on HTML/JS issues makes it a slower traffic, more focused group, and I thought the same could be useful for device development in AIR. Thoughts?

Wow, total fail on my part. I forgot to actually post the link to the new group: <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/adobe-air-for-devices">http://groups.google.com/group/adobe-air-for-devices</a>
