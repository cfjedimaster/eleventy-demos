I've tweeted about the <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/airlaunchpad/">Adobe AIR Launchpad</a> app before, but if this is the first you've heard of it, you should really take a look at it. The Launchpad quickly generates AIR applications with specific features. Want to see an example of how an AIR app can do drag and drop? Just enable it. Want to see storage device detection? Ditto. What's cool is that you can quickly generate a project you can load into Flash Builder and see these features in action. Today Adobe updated the Launchpad with mobile support. For people who have played with AIR but have yet to look at the mobile support, this is a great way to get started. I generated a few quick applications and the results were great. Normally I don't like generated code, but the output from this application is very well done and simple to read. They still don't yet support HTML based applications (but trust me, I keep bugging them :) but it is easily one of the best ways to learn (or play) with Adobe AIR.
