I've had a few requests for this over the last year, but from now on, when you subscribe to comments and are sent a new email, the FROM will be a generic address at my domain (blog@coldfusionjedi.com). It will <b>not</b> be the email address of the person who posted the comment. Some readers expressed concerns that other people in the same thread were getting a copy of their email address. Also - if anyone used an email address that bounced, the error would be sent to you after you posted your comment. Now they will all go to me. Woot. ;)
