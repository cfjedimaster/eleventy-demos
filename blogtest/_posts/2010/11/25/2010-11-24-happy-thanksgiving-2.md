Just a short and sweet wish to all my readers that they have an enjoyable and safe Thanksgiving. I'm <i>incredibly</i> thankful to you guys for a) providing me with great questions for blogging and b) providing me with great comments. I'm not sure if a simple 'blog' counts as a community but I think we have a great one here. So enjoy your turkey, enjoy your family, and especially enjoy watching the Saints completely decimate the Cowboys.
