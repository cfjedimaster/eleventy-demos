Check out these two videos posted by Anand, an Adobian, on ColdFusion Builder. The first blog entry is <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/anand/2011/01/learn-how-to-setup-a-project-and-configure-web-server-in-coldfusion-builder-3.html">Learn how to setup a project and configure web server in ColdFusion Builder</a>. The second entry is <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/anand/2011/01/learn-how-to-debug-coldfusion-applications-using-coldfusion-builder-2.html">Learn how to debug ColdFusion applications using ColdFusion Builder</a>. I've watched the second video and I found it to be very good.
