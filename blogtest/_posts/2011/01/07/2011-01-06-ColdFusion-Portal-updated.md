Just a quick note to let folks know I've updated <a href="http://www.coldfusionportal.org">ColdFusion Portal</a> for ColdFusion 9. I created the portal after being frustrated with finding resources on Adobe.com. (Great site - not always the easiest to find things on though.) I built it up a bit more to include additional information. It is <b>not</b> meant to cover <b>everything</b> about ColdFusion, but rather to be a quickie resource center for important links.

So as I said, I updated it a bit. It still needs more updates, especially in the jobs and conferences area. Thanks to Adam Lehman for sharing a Yahoo Pipe of a filtered CFBloggers feed (it is a bit more on topic).
