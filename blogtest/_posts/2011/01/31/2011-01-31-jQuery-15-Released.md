Just a quick note to let you know (those of you not on Twitter of course) that jQuery 1.5 has been released. You can find details on their <a href="http://blog.jquery.com/2011/01/31/jquery-15-released/">blog post</a>. I'm still wrapping my head around some of the changes, but shoot, even if you don't care about new functionality it looks like performance has been updated and that's <b>always</b> a good thing. I've found one blog entry that you may want to check out: <a href="http://www.erichynds.com/jquery/using-deferreds-in-jquery/">Using Deferreds in jQuery 1.5</a> This is one of the interesting new features in jQuery. I'll be honest and say that part of this is a bit confusing to me, but the main take is that if you've ever wanted to fire N async requests and fire a method when <b>all</b> are done - it is now ridiculously easy in jQuery. That's a big bottle of win to me.
