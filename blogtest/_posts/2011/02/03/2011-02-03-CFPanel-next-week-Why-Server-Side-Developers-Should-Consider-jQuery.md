Just a quick reminder that next Tuesday, at 11CST, there will be another meeting of the CFPanel: <a href="http://cfpanel.com/index.cfm/2011/1/18/Episode-6--Why-Server-Side-Developers-Should-Consider-jQuery">Why Server Side Developers Should Consider jQuery</a>. This will be a slightly smaller panel then last time. It includes Ben Nadel, Rey Bango, Doug Neiner, and myself. You've got two people who work on the jQuery team itself and two people who are big fans/users/bloggers on jQuery. So please attend and bring plenty of questions!
