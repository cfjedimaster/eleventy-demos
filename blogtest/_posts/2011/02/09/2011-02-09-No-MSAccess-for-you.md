I've recently updated both <a href="http://soundings.riaforge.org">Soundings</a> and <a href="http://lighthousepro.riaforge.org">Lighthouse Pro</a> for minor bugs and took the opportunity to remove Access from the docs and from the install folder. I'm not really against Access. I mean I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, not with MySQL being easy to use, but when I finally switched back to Windows after my fling with Apple, I found myself without an Access install. I have been able to get Aqua Data Studio connected to Access but it was a real pain in the rear. So I figured - why am I stressing out over a database format that is not recommended and not easy for me to keep up to date in my applications? Solution - drop it.
