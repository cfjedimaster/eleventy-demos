I typically try to save my video game/movie/off topic stuff until the weekend, but when I saw this video today I had to share it. As a warning, this video is incredibly NSWF for violence reasons. I consider us all adults here so if zombie level violence turns you off, please stop now. Anyway, watch the video, then I'm going to chime in with some thoughts.

Wow. So I've watched this video close to 5 times now and I'm still not sure if I'm disgusted or impressed by it. I am <i>not</i> a fan of bloody horror shows. I much rather a suspenseful show where the gore is kept to a minimum. I've like some of the recent zombie flicks, but in general I'll avoid shows like Saw. It just feels too real. I know there is real death out there. I'd rather my monsters be the Cloverfield variety or ghosts. (Ghosts aren't real - no matter what weird sounds I've heard in this house.) 

But - it isn't the violence really that hits you. It's the kid. I've found that my lack of interest in really bloody horror films seems to have come about right around the same time my wife and I grew our family. It seems that kids (teenagers) are the prime victims in horror films and I'm not ashamed to say I find it hard to watch. Back a few years ago I <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2006/8/17/Prey-Review-XBox-360">reviewed</a> Prey. The game featured the very violent and very realistic murder of a child. In my mind - even though the game takes place during an alien invasion - and yeah - if these guys are eating us like a drunk at Taco Bell then certainly they are eating kids - I just don't need to see that. I'll take my realism in frames per second and resolution. I don't need <i>that</i> much realism. 

I felt the same way in Revenge of the Sith when Anakin (off screen though) slaughters children. Yeah - I get that the Empire is bad. But you know what - I didn't need some Nazi comparison in my Star Wars movie. I wanted escapism - not the monster that may actually live next door. 

So that's a long winded way of saying - I don't want to see kids getting butchered in my video games... but in this trailer - it didn't feel quite as inappropriate as I'd expect. From what I know - the story is that you and your family are on an island when a zombie outbreak occurs. If there are very real consequences to not keeping your family safe and it's not gratuitous as it was in Prey - I could see this being a damn good game.

And wow - just the <i>mechanics</i> of this trailer and freaking amazing. The cuts between the different time flows. It's awesome. You see and appreciate more with each re-watching. 

So I've probably over analyzed this to death. What do you think?
