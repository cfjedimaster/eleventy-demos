Just a quick note to make sure everyone knows about <a href="http://www.riacon.com/">RIACon</a>, a new conference being held in Washington, DC August 6-7th. I'm on steering committee for the ColdFusion track. JavaScript, Flex, and AIR are also being covered. This is a two day conference for only $99. Potential speakers can submit topics and attendees can recommend sessions.
