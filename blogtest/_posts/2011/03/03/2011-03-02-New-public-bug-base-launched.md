Today at Scotch on the Rocks, Adam Lehman announced the launch of a new public bug base: <a href="http://bugbase.adobe.com">https://bugbase.adobe.com</a>. This is a simple, HTML-based application built in ColdFusion. Currently you can log bugs against ColdFusion Builder 2 and the bug base itself, but Adam has said all products (and old data) will be transitioned over time.
