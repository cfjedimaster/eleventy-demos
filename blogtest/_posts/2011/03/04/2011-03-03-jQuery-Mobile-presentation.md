Ouch. It's been a <i>long</i> time since I've had technical issues at a presentation so I guess I was due, but... ouch. I apologize to everyone in the room who had to suffer through the initial part of the presentation. Thankfully a reboot and a tip from an attendee (thanks Simon Notsureofyourlastname!) I was able to get moving again. I think though that people "got" the message. <b>jQuery Mobile is magic.</b> Seriously. One person told me afterwards that it was "scary" how easy jQuery Mobile is.

My plan is to start blogging about this a lot more. I was holding back until after this presentation since many of the examples I want to share come from the demos I built there. I'm also planning on asking Charlie Arehart if I can give this presentation to the Online meetup soon. 

You can view the slides below and download the examples via the embedded menu. If anyone has any questions, let me know.
