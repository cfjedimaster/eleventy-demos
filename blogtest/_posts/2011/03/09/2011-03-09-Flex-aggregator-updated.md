Just a quick note to remind folks that <a href="http://www.boyzoid.com">Scott Stroz</a> manages a blog aggregator focused on Flex topics. You can find it here: <a href="http://allyourflexarebelongtous.com/">http://allyourflexarebelongtous.com/</a>. I mention it because a) people might have forgotten and it's darn useful and b) he <a href="http://www.boyzoid.com/blog/index.cfm/2011/3/9/Updates-to-AllYourFlexAreBelongToUscom">updated</a> it today to start driving tweets on content updates. The site makes use of the open source version of <a href="http://www.coldfusionbloggers.org">ColdFusion Bloggers</a>. This is also in use at <a href="http://www.androidgator.com">AndroidGator</a> and <a href="http://www.warcraftbloggers.com/">WarcraftBloggers</a>.
