Since some people still avoid Twitter like the plague (and honestly, it does feel like a plague at times ;), I thought I'd help spread the word that <a href="http://www.jquerymobile.com">jQuery Mobile</a> has released a new version, Alpha 4. You can find details about the update <a href="http://jquerymobile.com/2011/03/jquery-mobile-alpha-4-released/">here</a>. They are aiming for a beta release at the jQuery Conference next month (where I'll be speaking) with a final 1.0 release around late Spring. All five of you using a Windows Phone 7 will be happy to know you are now supported.

Also released today was <a href="http://blog.jquery.com/2011/03/31/jquery-152-released/">jQuery 1.5.2</a>. This is purely a bug fix release. No new features were added.
