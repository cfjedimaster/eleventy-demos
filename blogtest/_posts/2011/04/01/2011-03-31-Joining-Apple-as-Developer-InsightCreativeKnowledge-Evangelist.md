<img src="https://static.raymondcamden.com/images/cfjedi/rayapple.jpg" align="left"  /> I'm proud to announce that as of today I will be joining Apple as an Evangelist, specifically in their Developer Insight/Creative/Knowledge department. This new department is focused on working with developers across a broad spectrum of products and knowledge areas. My focus will be on the iOS landscape and developer tools and technologies. I've long stated that that I've felt that iOS offers developers the most choice. From Objective-C to Objective-C, developers have a variety of ways to build compelling apps that allow you to direct avians towards suids. I plan on spending most of my time on Windows tools and the iOS platform which will additionally give me more time to pursue my hobbies as well. 

<p>

This change in life may be drastic for some, but I assure you it's been in the works for some time. Once the ritual Steve Jobs tattoo has been attached to my body I'll be spending most of my time in the Louisiana Apple office next to Merlotte's. (I've been assured that the swamp has been drained and only a few alligators are left in the kitchen. Or as we call them - appetizers.) 

<p>

As an example of what you can expect to see here - consider the following Hello Word example in Objective-C:
<p>

<code>
#import &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main( int argc, const char *argv[] ) {
    printf( "hello world\n" );
    return 0;
}
</code>
<p>

Pure simplicity. Now compare this to ColdFusion:
<p>

<code>
Hello World
</code>
<p>

What? Seriously? That's a programing language? Not one include. Not one method with stars in front of it. Inconceivable. Real languages simply don't work that way. You just aren't winning unless your compiling and linking. You can quote me on that. 
<p>

But I won't just be covering code. I'll also talk about how best developers can get their apps into the App Store. I'll divulge the hidden secrets to avoiding rejection and what to do we when decide your type of app is no longer desirable months after it was approved. (Hint - it was your fault - you just didn't know it.) 
<p>

I for one will be happy to rid myself of all the pesky Android devices that began to clutter my home. I cannot tell you how much time I wasted configuring my devices to my liking when I simply should have trusted the designers at Apple to decide for me what is best. The relief I feel now that the weight of responsibility is off my shoulders is indescribable. I feel safe and warm within the arms of Apple UX - like a cookie in Cookie Monster's stomach. Excellent.
