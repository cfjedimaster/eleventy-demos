Thank you to everyone who attended my presentation today on HTML5. This is a topic that is new to me and I hope I was able to help introduce it well to others. I've included my presentation from SlideSix below. In it you will find the slides, a link to the recording, and my code attached. Any feedback, positive or negative, is greatly appreciated. (And if you don't want to use a public comment, just hit the Contact link above.)
