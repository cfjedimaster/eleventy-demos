On Saturday, April 30th in San Francisco, there will be free, all day Flash Camp focusing on Flex 4.5 and mobile development. This is an excellent opportunity to get introduced to the framework or get acquainted with the mobile side of Flex. Both iOS and Playbook development will be covered. Adobe team members will be on hand to provide support. Registration (and more details) can be found here:
