Looks like Todd Sharp beat me to the punch on Twitter (that's ok, I'm just going to bring the <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2011/4/26/Bring-the-Misery-Hammer-down-on-your-trolls">misery hammer</a> into effect on him!) but for folks who aren't on I thought I'd share some exciting news. Adobe will be releasing ColdFusion Builder 2 soon, and one of the new features is an "Express" edition. After your 60 day trial ends (which you have to admit is a good long trial!), CFBuilder2 will revert to an Express Edition. Under this mode the following features will be disabled:

<ul>
<li>code assist for extensions (powerful feature, but no one is using it yet afaik)
<li>code insight (this is NOT syntax helping)
<li>extension callbacks (a good extension will note this during startup and try to handle it)
<li><strike>RDS</strike>No registration of remote servers
<li>quick fix
<li>debugging... but just of remote projects (so you can still use the debugger locally which makes more sense imo)
<li>refactoring
<li>ColdFusion search...but you can still use the built in search and some folks prefer that anyway 
<li>code formatting (never used it)
<li>FTP support (ditto)
<li>log viewer - you can add this from other sources, or even just simply run tail from the command line
<li>local file support (ditto)
<li>code hyperlinks (no idea what this is)
<li>hover help
</ul>

So - a few things are painful here, but for a free edition, I think it's pretty darn awesome. Thank you Adobe!
