Two free, online presentations are happening tomorrow that I think my readers may be interested in.

The first is "Top 10 Features of CS5.5". The description of this presentation is:

<blockquote>
Join us Thursday, April 28, from 8.30 a.m. â€“ 9.30 a.m. Pacific Time and learn more about the top 10 features of CS5.5 from the Creative Suite Evangelist team. Once again, we'll be giving away some CS goodies, so you really don't want to miss this!

Adobe Evangelists Terry White (Design), Rufus Deuchler (Design) Greg Rewis (Web), Paul Trani (Flash Platform) and Jason Levine (Digital Video & Audio) will be on hand to guide you through some of the top features in CS5.5. Learn about better HTML5 support, Flash authoring, digital publishing, designing and developing for multiple devices including tablets, and find out about latest innovations in video and audio technologies.
</blockquote>

The Connect room URL is <a href="http://my.adobe.acrobat.com/askcspro">http://my.adobe.acrobat.com/askcspro</a>. Apparently there will also be giveaways!

The next meeting is "Introduction to jQuery Mobile" by yours truly. It's at 11 CST (right after the last meeting ends) and will also be on connect. This is a repeat of what I did in San Jose a few weeks back. More details may be found here: <a href="http://www.meetup.com/coldfusionmeetup/events/17235517/">http://www.meetup.com/coldfusionmeetup/events/17235517/</a> No giveways, but I'll show off my Playbook, assuming it actually arrives today.
