<img src="https://static.raymondcamden.com/images/cfjedi/best-javascript-resources1.jpg" style="float:left;margin-right:5px"/> I got an email (a few weeks back - sorry - trying to keep up ;) from a developer who wants to use jQuery but doesn't really know JavaScript first. Having to learn how to walk before you run - I was curious as to what folks recommend for the best way to learn JavaScript? I'll list out a few options here and I'd love for my readers to comment on what they would recommend.

For me, I initially learned via documentation on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript">Netscape's</a> web site. That was back in 96 or so, but the developer network has come a long way since then. Oddly they list out the reference before the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Guide">guide</a> - I'd definitely start with the guide.

The other big help for me was the O'Reilly book  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596805527/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=raymondcamden-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399349&creativeASIN=0596805527">JavaScript: The Definitive Guide</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=raymondcamden-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0596805527&camp=217145&creative=399349" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />. I have a few of the old editions on my bookshelf and will probably pick up this new 6th edition in PDF. You can find other good <a href="http://oreilly.com/javascript/index.html">JavaScript-related ORA books</a> as well.

Another book - although one that can at times be complex - is <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2010/6/15/Review-ObjectOriented-JavaScript">Object-Oriented JavaScript</a> by Steven Stefanov. I reviewed that last year and made the point that it had quite a bit of good introductory material as well. 

Another option are conferences. I had always assumed the jQuery conferences were for Ninjas only. (Ok, JavaScript Ninjas I mean.) And while the average technical level was quite high, the quality was excellent and I'd still recommend it for someone new. Just be prepared to take a lot of notes and ask questions. Of course, the excellent cfObjective that just ended also had multiple JavaScript sessions. I saw excellent ones from Ezra Parker and Elliot Sprehn that were both pretty darn enlightening. 

Lastly - don't forget that all of this runs in a browser. If you've got a browser (and - um - you must) and a text editor that you have all the bare minimum tools you need. You may want to look at using Dreamweaver to help out - or the excellent Aptana editor as well. 

Like most things - how you learn best is something <i>you</i> know. Books, online training, just playing, or a mix of all, figure out what works best for you and just make the time.
