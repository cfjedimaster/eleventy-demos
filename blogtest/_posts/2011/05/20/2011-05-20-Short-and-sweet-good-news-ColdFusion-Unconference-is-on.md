<img src="https://static.raymondcamden.com/images/cfjedi/Fotolia_3165893_Subscription_XXL.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 5px;margin-bottom:5px" /> I tweeted this earlier but since some of you have managed to resit the crack known as Twitter, I'm happy to announce that the ColdFusion Unconference will be on again for MAX 2011. Once again I'll be joined by Charlie and Ezra. We will be providing more details soon. (Please do not send topic ideas just yet - give us a bit of time.)
