You can now download INeedIt from the Google Market. Either by searching for "INeedIt" on your mobile device, or just going to the <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=air.INeedIt&feature=search_result">web site</a> and installing from there. (If you've set up the Market to 'know' about your device.) 

For folks curious about my earlier complaining about market access, it turned out my market account was using an account that I had simply forgotten about. Google customer service confirmed that once I set up a new Google Market account on my primary domain they would be able to transfer the apps over and reimburse me the 25 dollar cost. 

Unfortunately, to sign up for Google Market access I need a credit card on file and the bug I reported <b>over a month ago</b> still prevents me from adding a credit card to my Google Apps hosted domain. *sigh* 

Anyway - download the app and try it out. And remember, you can grab the source here: <a href="https://github.com/cfjedimaster/ineedit">https://github.com/cfjedimaster/ineedit</a>
