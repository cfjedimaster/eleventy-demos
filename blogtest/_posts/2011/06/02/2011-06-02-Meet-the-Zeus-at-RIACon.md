<img src="https://static.raymondcamden.com/images/cfjedi/ZEUS_ON_WHITE.JPEG.jpg" style="float:left;margin-right: 5px" />Details have been slowly leaking out about the next version of ColdFusion, but I believe we've only today discovered the code name: Zeus. Adobe will be presenting new details on Zeus at RIACON - you can see information about their sessions <a href="http://www.riacon.com/sponsors/adobe">here</a>. As a reminder, <a href="http://www.riacon.com/">RIACON</a> is being held in Washington, DC on August 6th and 7th. I'm working on selecting sessions and the lineup so far is pretty darn tootin fascinating! (You can quote me on that.)
