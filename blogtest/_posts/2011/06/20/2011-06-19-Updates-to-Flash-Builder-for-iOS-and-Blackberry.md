<img src="https://static.raymondcamden.com/images/cfjedi/Adobe_Flash_Builder_4_Logo.png" align="left" /> Just a quick note to let folks know Adobe has updated Flash Builder 4.5 today to add support for iOS and Blackberry Playbook. This means you can now easily push out <b>one</b> project to all three platforms - even on a Windows device. (I did this myself.) For more details, check out these two blog posts:

I'm going to have an iPad pretty soon and once I can - I'll report on how well the process works. 

As a reminder - I'll be talking about Flash Builder and ColdFusion this week - Thursday at 5PM. You can sign up for free <a href="http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/event/index.cfm?event=detail&id=1489921&loc=en_us">here</a>.
