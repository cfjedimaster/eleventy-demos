My session is on Flex 4.5 and ColdFusion. I'm assuming most of my audience will be ColdFusion developers with little to no Flex experience. So I'll be showing examples of Flex, AIR, and of course mobile applications. I'm assuming the language will be new to you so I'll keep it simple, but show you how Flash Builder can help you develop. The ColdFusion side will be a bit smaller since - well let's face it - ColdFusion makes it easy to serve content up. But I do have some interesting examples I think you guys will like.

Anyway - that's the idea. I hope to see many of my readers will there.
