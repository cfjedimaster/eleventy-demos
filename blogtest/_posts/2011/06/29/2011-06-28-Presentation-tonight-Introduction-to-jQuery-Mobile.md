Tonight I'll be giving a presentation to the <a href="http://groups.adobe.com/group/861">Bloomington/Normal, IL Rich Internet Applications Group</a>. I'll be talking about jQuery Mobile and how to build mobile-friendly HTML web sites with it. There's a small bit of ColdFusion in it but it's primarily about the JQM framework. This is not a new presentation so if you've attended it before, you won't be missing anything. The user group has graciously allowed me to invite the public, so check the <a href="http://groups.adobe.com/index.cfm?event=post.display&postid=36693">event detail</a> for the Connect URL <b>later today</b>. (URL isn't up yet.) As a quick warning - do know that as my host, I'm going to give the UG priority in answering questions, but obviously I'll try my best to answer everything as best I can.

The time is 6:30PM Central time - or a bit less than 12 hours from now.
