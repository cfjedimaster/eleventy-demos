So I'm a bit late to help spread the news, but both <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/flashplatformruntimes/air3/">Adobe AIR 3</a> and <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/flashplatformruntimes/flashplayer11/">Flash Player 11</a> betas have hit Adobe Labs. You can check those links for details, but here are some things I'm excited about...
<!--more-->
<ul>
<li>Stage3D graphics - Not that I can do any fancy graphics myself - but I'm real excited to see what game developers do with this
<li>Native JSON support - bout time. It's not hard to add JSON support into your Flex apps now, but it's nice to see it built in
<li>Cubic Bezier Curves - I have no freaking idea what these are but I love saying "Bezier Curves"
<li>Native 64 bit support 
</ul>

This is just for desktop right now but obviously mobile is coming. 

The other big news is from Sony. This caught me totally by surprise. Adobe and Sony are running a contest (details here: <a href="http://www.airappchallenge.com/">http://www.airappchallenge.com</a>) where developers can win up to $130,000 dollars. Let me write that again just so folks are sure it isn't a typo: $130,000. There's quite a lot of money to give away along with other prizes - all for authoring cool Adobe AIR applications. I have to say - their devices look really cool - and the clam shell/DS-inspired design of their second tablet is fascinating.
