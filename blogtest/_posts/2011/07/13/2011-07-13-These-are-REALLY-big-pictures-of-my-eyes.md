Be warned - what follows is somewhat gross giant pictures of my eyes. It isn't bloody or anything, but if medical pictures make you sick to your stomach, consider this your only warning...

Yesterday I went to the eye doctor for a checkup. I had a bit of a scare a few weeks ago when I went to the DMV and found that I could barely read the letters during the eye test. I've always had a weak left eye and felt like I had pretty poor vision for small text and stuff like that, but the DMV visit was a bit of a wake up call. I can stand being overweight. I can stand losing the use of my legs even. But the thought of losing my eyes is pretty scary. Turns out though my eye sight wasn't nearly as bad as I thought. I've got 20/20 in the right and 20/30 in the left. The only concern the doc had was that nothing seemed to work for improving the vision in the left eye. This could have been a cataract or something else. They did a few quick tests and did see some 'extra' nerve tissue around my left eye and some basic general underdevelopment that account for the issue. Basically, no big deal, I've had it all my life, etc etc. But to be safe they wanted to take some high res pictures and check it again next year to see if there was any difference. 

When they took the pictures and I saw them - I thought it was incredibly cool. I asked if I could get a copy (I had hope it wouldn't be an issue, they're my eyes after all), and the doctor said it would not be a problem. I just got the pictures today. For each you an click for a <i>really</i> big version but I wouldn't recommend that.


<h2>Right Eye</h2>

<h2>Left Eye</h2>

You can kind of see the additional nerve stuff (white stuff) in this pic.

Of course, as long as my eyes do not look like this, I've got nothing to worry about...
