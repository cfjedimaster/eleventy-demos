I just published the final scheduled for this years ColdFusion Unconference at MAX:

<a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/page.cfm/coldfusion-unconference">ColdFusion Unconference</a>

Thank you Google Docs for making it easy. Obviously this may change a bit between now and MAX, but this should be pretty solid. We've got a few more things that may happen as well (prizes for example ;) so stay tuned.

Do not forget the Lanyrd page set up by Matt Gifford: <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2011/coldfusion-unconference-adobe-max/">http://lanyrd.com/2011/coldfusion-unconference-adobe-max/</a>. Matt will be updating the data there soon. Also note that MAX attendees will be able to see our sessions in the official schedule soon as well.

My thanks to all the speakers and co-managers Ezra Parker and Scott Stroz.
