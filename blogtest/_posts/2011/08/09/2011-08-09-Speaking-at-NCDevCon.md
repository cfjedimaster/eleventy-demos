<img src="https://static.raymondcamden.com/images/cfjedi/ncdevcon-logo.png" style="float:left;margin-right: 10px" /> I'm <i>very</i> happy to be attending, and speaking at, my first <a href="http://ncdevcon.com/">NCDevCon</a> NCDevCon will be held September 17-18th at the Centennial Campus of NC State University in Raleigh, North Carolina. I'll be doing two topics - one a basic introduction to jQuery Mobile, and the second a brand new ColdFusion topic that I'm pretty excited about. Adobe is a sponsor and we've got 5 sessions total, including Terry Ryan and Josh Adams as well as the new ColdFusion Product Manager doing the keynote! The price is a cheap 60 bucks and you can register here: <a href="http://ncdevcon.eventbrite.com/">http://ncdevcon.eventbrite.com/</a>

This will be my first public presentation as an Adobe evangelist - so rampant heckling will be expected and appreciated!
