I'm a bit late on this, but Labs has an update for the <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/flashplatformruntimes/air3/">Adobe AIR 3 Beta</a>. Some interesting new features in this update are...

<ul>
<li>Stage Video Hardware Acceleration (AIR for mobile)</li>
<li>Captive Runtime Support (AIR for desktop and Android)</li>
<li>iOS Background Audio Playback Support</li>
<li>Android Licensing Service Support</li>
<li>Android Front-facing Camera Support</li>
<li>Encrypted Local Storage for Mobile</li>
<li>H.264/AVC Software Encoding for Cameras (desktop)</li>
</ul>

See the labs site for more details, but I want to especially call out the captive runtime item. What this means - practically - is that your apps can ship <b>with</b> the AIR runtime in it. No need for a separate download.
