Almost five years ago, I wrote a blog entry (<a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2006/10/20/How-ColdFusion-can-save-you-business">How ColdFusion can save your business!</a>) that discussed how you can use the simple act of session expiration to track, and manage, abandoned user processes on your site. The title was a bit over the topic, but the use case, noticing folks bailing out of the order process on a particular step, was something that I thought could be critical to a business. 

I bring this up this weekend because earlier in the week I did some shopping at <a href="http://www.zazzle.com/">Zazzle</a>. This was for something super important (ok, maybe not), but when I got to the shipping part of my order, I realized I would not be able to get my item in time unless I paid a <i>lot</i> of money. Since it wasn't really that important to me, I closed the tab and forgot about it. 

This morning I got an email from Zazzle. Check it out:

I love how they call me a valued customer and how they talk about my "carefully selected" items. A bit much - but - you have to admit - this is great followup. I don't think it's clear in the shot (and it may not even be in it), but the email also says:

<blockquote>
If you had trouble with our order process and require assistance with your order, please contact our customer service team: support@zazzle.com.
</blockquote>

It's pretty small text. I'd maybe make it a bit bigger to make it more obvious. Either way - you could easily do the same in an e-commerce ColdFusion site.
