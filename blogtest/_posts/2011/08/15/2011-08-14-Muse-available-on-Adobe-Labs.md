Today we've released another new beta to Adobe Labs, <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/muse/">Muse</a>. What is Muse? To quote labs:

<blockquote>
Muse (codename) enables designers to create websites as easily as creating a layout for print. Design and publish original HTML pages using the latest web standards, and without writing code.
</blockquote>

Now - I know that is <b>not</b> something that will probably interest most of my readers. I definitely have a more developer-heavy crowd then designer. However, I do think you should check out Muse anyway. Why? It's an AIR-based application and easily one of the most impressive ones I've ever seen. The site tree, for example, works really well.

The design aspect feels pretty powerful too. You can drag and drop widgets in that tie into data (for example, a menu that links to your site plan) or your file system. The output HTML is kinda clean too. 

For more information, and a FAQ on pricing, check out the site: <a href="http://muse.adobe.com/index.html">http://muse.adobe.com</a>. As I said, I don't expect many of my readers to need this tool, but I strongly recommend downloading and playing with it. It is a great example of what's possible with Adobe AIR.
