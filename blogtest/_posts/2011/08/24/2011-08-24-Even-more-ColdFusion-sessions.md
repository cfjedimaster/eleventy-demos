<img src="https://static.raymondcamden.com/images/cfjedi/coldfusion_logo.png" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px" /> I mentioned my <a href="http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/event/index.cfm?event=detail&id=1864016&loc=en_us">upcoming talk</a> on ColdFusion and Solr as well as 11 new sessions at <a href="http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/event/index.cfm?event=detail&id=1489920&loc=en_us">Adobe ColdFusion Developer Week</a>. If that's not enough though, there are two other sessions coming up soon as well:

<a href="http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/event/index.cfm?event=detail&id=1844274">ColdFusion 9: Ridiculously Easy: The Basics</a><br/>
<a href="http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/event/index.cfm?event=detail&id=1864012">ColdFusion 9: Ridiculously Easy: Web Applications</a>

That's 14 ColdFusion sessions in the next few weeks - all free!
