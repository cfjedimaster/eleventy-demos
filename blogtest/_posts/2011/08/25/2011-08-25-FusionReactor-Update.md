You can see a full list of what's new <a href="http://www.fusion-reactor.com/fr/whatsnew4.cfm">here</a> and download a trial <a href="http://www.fusion-reactor.com/fr/downloads.cfm">here</a>. FusionReactor also integrates with <a href="http://www.fusion-analytics.com/fa/">FusionAnalytics</a>, a product that is coming soon and is - quite frankly - pretty damn incredible if you've not seen it yet.
