Folks, I've long praised the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet.html">Adobe Developer Connection</a> as one of the best underutilized sites on the net. I discovered that they put out (internally) a list of new content every week. I'm going to start publishing that here to help spread the word. Enjoy.
