Today I released version 2.5.0 of <a href="http://galleon.riaforge.org">Galleon Forums</a>. This update has a few bug fixes but also includes two new (and cool I think) features:

<ul>
<li>You can now one click delete from emails. When using the sendonpost setting, an administrator always get a copy of new posts whether they are subscribed or not. In that email is a link that when clicked will automatically delete the message (and the thread if empty) and the user. You don't need to logon - just click and nuke.
<li>You can now specify a rank value for forums to override the default alpha sort behavior. 
</ul>

As always - Galleon is 100% free (but <a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/registry/2TCL1D08EZEYE">wishlist</a> supported ;) for any use whatsoever.
