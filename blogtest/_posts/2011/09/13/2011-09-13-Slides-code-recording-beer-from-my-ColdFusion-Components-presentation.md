Title says it all. But the beer is a lie. Sorry. Note - for the recording url, you must be a registered Adobe.com user to view it. This is free and a one time process. 

<p/>

<object height="425" width="550"><param name="movie" value="http://slidesix.com/viewer/SlideSixViewer.swf?alias=Introduction-to-CFCs" /><param name="menu" value="false"/><param name="scale" value="noScale"/><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"/><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always" /><param value="transparent" name="wmode" /><param value="quality" name="best" /><embed src="http://slidesix.com/viewer/SlideSixViewer.swf?alias=Introduction-to-CFCs" allowscriptaccess="always" allowFullScreen="true" height="425" width="550" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" quality="best" /></object>

<p/>

For folks not used to the SlideSix interface, just click the "Show Menu" button to get the attachment and the recording URL.

By the way, for folks still waiting on the Solr recording URL, I'm working on it still. Sorry!
