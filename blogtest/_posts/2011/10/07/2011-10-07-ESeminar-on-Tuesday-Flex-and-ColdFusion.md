Next Tuesday, at 12PM CST, I'll be giving an online presentation titled "Flex 4.5 and ColdFusion." This is an Adobe e-seminar so please remember that you will need to RSVP in order to participate: <a href="http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/event/index.cfm?event=detail&id=1880349&loc=en_us">Flex 4.5 with ColdFusion</a>. This session will be a basic introduction to Flex 4.5 with a focus on using ColdFusion as the back end service for data.
