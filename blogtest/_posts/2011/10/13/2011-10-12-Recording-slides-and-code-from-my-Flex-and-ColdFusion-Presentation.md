As always, I'm making use of the excellent, ColdFusion-powered, <a href="http://www.slidesix.com">SlideSix</a> service for my presentation. You can get the attachment and recording url by clicking the menu. Note - you will have to have an Adobe.com username to get into the recording. That's free and takes 2 seconds (ok, maybe 3), so do not let that deter you from hearing the smooth silky vocal intonations of the Jedi himself, me. (Wow, that was about as egotistical as I can get... ;)
