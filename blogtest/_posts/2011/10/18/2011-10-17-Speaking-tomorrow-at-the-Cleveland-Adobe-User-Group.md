Due to a last minute cancellation, I'll be speaking, virtually, to the Cleveland Adobe User Group. Folks local to Cleveland can find the address <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Cleveland-Adobe-User-Group/events/37414392/">here</a>.  For the rest of the world, you can join in <a href="http://experts.adobeconnect.com/underusedcf/">here</a> via Connect. I'll be giving priority question-wise/comment-wise to the folks local to the user group, but I'll try my best to help as many people in the room as possible. My talk will be a repeat of the session I gave at NCDevCon on underused and under-appreciated features of ColdFusion. (Which I have to admit - I was surprised and pleased that some of the things I thought people <i>weren't</i> using turned out to be wrong!) The meeting starts at 5:30PM CST. Due to the last minute nature of this presentation, I'll have to take care of my kids at the same time. While they are old enough now to play by themselves, there will probably be one or two small interruptions. Be warned. 

I hope to see you there!
