First up is <a href="http://cfgloss.com/">Gloss</a>, a new ColdFusion reference that includes both built in functions as well as <a href="http://www.cflib.org">CFLib.org</a> UDFs. So a search for email, for example...

returns both CFLib and built-in functionality. 

Second - a new ColdFusion podcast has been born. I don't believe it has it's own site, but the podcast is called (again, I'm a bit confused as it's not terribly clear) the "ColdFusion Show" and the first entry is available here: <a href="http://henke.ws/post.cfm/get-your-red-hot-first-cfml-show-podcast-here">http://henke.ws/post.cfm/get-your-red-hot-first-cfml-show-podcast-here</a> It is the creation of Mike Henke and Ryan Stille.
