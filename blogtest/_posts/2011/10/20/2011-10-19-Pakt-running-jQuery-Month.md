It's a bit late for me to be blogging it, but I figure the details are good enough that it doesn't really matter. Pakt (the guys publishing my book on jQuery Mobile) are running what they call 'jQuery Month'. This means cheaper prices and other discounts for their jQuery books. You can find details here: <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/news/jquery-month">https://www.packtpub.com/news/jquery-month</a> Pakt carries a good selection of jQuery books covering jQuery itself (obviously), jQuery UI, and an earlier book on jQuery Mobile.
