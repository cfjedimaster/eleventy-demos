Harlan, my <i>very</i> old open source ColdFusion ad service, has been updated to remove Flash Forms. For some reason they didn't show any data in ColdFusion 9, and frankly, no one should be using Flash Forms anyway. I changed them to simple HTML tabs. While not as pretty, the application at least works now. The whole thing really needs to be overhauled, but as I have no idea how useful it is to people, it isn't really high on my priority list. As it stands - it works - it's open source - enjoy. ;)
