For those of you attending my <a href="http://www.fitc.ca/events/presentations/presentation.cfm?event=121&presentation_id=1709">Extending ColdFusion</a> presentation at RIAUnleashed tomorrow, please note that I've made the code available for the session now.

<a href="http://bit.ly/extcfcode">http://bit.ly/extcfcode</a>

It requires ColdFusion 9.0.1 but a lot of the code will work on earlier ColdFusion servers as well. While not a lab, I encourage folks who want to 'work along' with me to get the code down and try things out while I present. 

I hope to see a few readers there. I'm also <a href="http://www.fitc.ca/events/presentations/presentation.cfm?event=121&presentation_id=1685">presenting</a> on jQuery.
