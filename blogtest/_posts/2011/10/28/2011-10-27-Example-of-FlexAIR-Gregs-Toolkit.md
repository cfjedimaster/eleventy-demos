My boss sent me this yesterday and I think it's one of the coolest examples of Flex/AIR I've seen in a while. <a href="http://www.gregstoolkit.com/">Greg's Toolkit</a> (I love the product, don't love the name so much) is a desktop/mobile application that let's you monitor your Amazon web service assets. It gives you a real time view of your instances. I don't have any great screen shots, but I'll steal one from his site:

His application essentially turns your Amazon assets into a virtual server room, allowing you to work with them in a much simpler, quicker fashion then heading over to Amazon's web site.

Greg's Toolkit is available for desktop, iOS, and soon for Android tablets.

By the way, if any of my readers are building cool AIR applications, drop me a line.
