This is a topic I've kinda covered here before, and it is <i>certainly</i> a topic I think will have many different opinions (and will change over time), but what do people think about the question below?

<blockquote>
Can you recommend a best approach or best practice for developing a website for multiple devices? Should I try to detect screen sizes and basically have two or three sets of pages each dedicated to a range of display sizes. Or should I instead use the CSS approach? I predict that prevailing wisdom with say CSS but I tend to want to use the first approach.
</blockquote>

Personally my gut tells me that while CSS allows us to gracefully handle desktop versus mobile (at least sometimes), it doesn't always make sense for a mobile site to mimic a desktop site. For example, a RIA like a site administrator might not make sense to have 1-1 feature equality on mobile. There are some tasks I can't imagine needing or <i>wanting</i> to do on a mobile device. So I'd rather the mobile application focus on a subset of things that make sense to do on a phone versus trying to fit everything in. On the flip side, I fully expect simple content sites, like blogs, to have the same feature set on desktop versus mobile.

In other words - I would not automatically try to force the exact same site onto other devices - possible or not. 

Thoughts?
