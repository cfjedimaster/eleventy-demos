My readers know I'm an avid video gamer, and I've been reading the reviews for Skyrim, the latest Elder Scrolls game with great interest. One of the more interesting facts I read this week was that the game would support infinite, randomly generated quests. While these quests will - probably - be somewhat simple - it is an interesting concept and probably something that was fun to code.

So with that being said, your Friday Puzzler is to create this concept. No, I'm not asking you to build a RPG. Not at all. Rather, I'm asking you to simply generate a quest description in text. You can go serious...

<blockquote>
Travel to the mount of San'tooth and find the evil necromancer Lord Maelneborn. Slay him and bring back the Amulet of Kings so that peace be returned to the kingdom.
</blockquote>

Or not so serious...

<blockquote>
Travel to the mount of the Slightly Lemon-Scented Peaks of Fred. Slay the not-terribly-evil-just-a-bit-lazy accountant Bob and bring back the Sword of Copy and Paste+1.
</blockquote>

As always, this should be fun, quick, and please use pastebin to share your code. You can paste the results in the comment though.
