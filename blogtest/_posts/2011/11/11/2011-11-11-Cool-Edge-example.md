I'm still trying to find more time to play with <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/edge/">Edge</a>, but at my local user group meeting last month the co-manager, Ryan Letulle, demoed what I thought was a nice example of the tool in action. At our meeting he demonstrated using Edge to build a simple rotating banner for a web site. I've seen this done before with jQuery plugins, but he wanted to try out the tool himself. It was very direct, very simple, and very quick to set up, and best of all it wasn't difficult to tweak. You can see the site below. Be warned - the site itself is very rough and still very in progress, but watch the animation and then - like all good developers, take a look at the source.
