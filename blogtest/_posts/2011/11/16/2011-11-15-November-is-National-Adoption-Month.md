Once again I'm late to remind folks, but November is National Adoption Month, and the 19th is <a href="http://www.nationaladoptionday.org/">National Adoption Day</a>. If you have every considered adoption, or even if you haven't, it's a great time to look into it. I assume most folks know this, but my own family was grown via adoption. My wife and I adopted three kids from South Korea over the past decade. It's a process that is... quite involved. But it's doable. And the rewards are beyond description. I typically recommend folks check out <a href="http://www.adoption.org/">Adoption.org</a> as a starting point. You can also contact local adoption agencies for a meeting to discuss possibilities. I'm open to questions too - either here on the blog or privately via my contact form.
