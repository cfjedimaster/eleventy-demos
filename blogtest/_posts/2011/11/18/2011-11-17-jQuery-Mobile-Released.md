Ok, I'm a <b>whole</b> day late - sorry (grin), but for the five of you who missed the news, the final release of <a href="http://jquerymobile.com/">jQuery Mobile</a> is now available. I think folks know how much of a fan I am of this framework. I think it's one of the easiest ways to build mobile-optimized sites out there. I definitely recommend taking a look at it. I'm working with <a href="http://www.andymatthews.net/">Andy Mathews</a> on a jQuery Mobile book for Packt that will hopefully go live sometime in early 2012. I'm also hoping to have a Udemy course ready by the end of the month. As I said - I'm a fan!
