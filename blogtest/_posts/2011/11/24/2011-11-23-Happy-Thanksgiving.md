(Note - this is almost an <i>exact</i> copy of my post from last year, but, I liked it, and it's a holiday, so I'm allowed to duplicate a post. ;)

Just a short and sweet wish to all my readers that they have an enjoyable and safe Thanksgiving. I'm <i>incredibly</i> thankful to you guys for a) providing me with great questions for blogging and b) providing me with great comments. I'm not sure if a simple 'blog' counts as a community but I think we have a great one here. Thanks!
