Luis Majano is running a <a href="http://blog.coldbox.org/post.cfm/code-some-coldbox-win-a-kindle-fire-or-ipod">cool little contest</a> where anyone who writes a ColdBox module by December 16th will have a chance to win a Kindle Fire. Second prize is an iPod Nano. If you haven't yet taken a look at ColdBox, now is definitely a great time to check it out!
