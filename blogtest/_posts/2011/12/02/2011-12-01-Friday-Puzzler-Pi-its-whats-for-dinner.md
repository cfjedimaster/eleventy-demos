Today's Friday Puzzler is one that I almost skipped out on. It seems too simple. But the more I thought about it, the more I thought it might be fun to actually see what people do with it. And since most of my supposedly "5 minute puzzlers" end up not being that quick, hopefully this one will make up for it. Being that I think this one is a bit simpler, the winner of the contest will be based purely on how cool you display the results. Use HTML, use JavaScript, use PDFs with blinking lights, I don't care. Go crazy. Your coding contest this morning is - build a utility that returns the digits of Pi up to N significant digits. So given func(2), the result should be 14. Given func(4), it would be 1415. It should work from any number up to 1,000,000. And if you create a solution that <i>can</i> do a million and render it quickly, you get bonus points.
