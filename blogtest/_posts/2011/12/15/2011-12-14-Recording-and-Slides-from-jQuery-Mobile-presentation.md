If you were not able to attend my presentation yesterday, you can now watch the recording URL below.

You will have to register, bu once you do, you can view it. I've attached the PDF and code samples below. The presentation is right over one hour. I had to rush a bit towards the end, so some things got skipped. Not to turn this into an upsell, but as a reminder, I'll be releasing my Udemy presentation very soon (should be next week) and that will have a lot more time to go over examples.<p><a href='enclosures/C{% raw %}%3A%{% endraw %}5Chosts{% raw %}%5C2012%{% endraw %}2Eraymondcamden{% raw %}%2Ecom%{% endraw %}5Cenclosures{% raw %}%2Fintro%{% endraw %}20to{% raw %}%20jquery%{% endraw %}20mobile%2Ezip'>Download attached file.</a></p>
