I finally got time to wrap up my jQuery Mobile course for Udemy: <a href="http://www.udemy.com/introduction-to-jquery-mobile/">http://www.udemy.com/introduction-to-jquery-mobile/</a>. The course costs 20 dollars and is about an hour and a half. I also plan on adding 'Extras' as I get feedback from people on specific examples. (When you pay for the course, you have access to anything added later.) I learned a bit from my <a href="http://www.udemy.com/introduction-to-jquery/">jQuery course</a> and broke up the content into much smaller bits. I also tried to make it more obvious which files were used for demos to make it easier to follow.

As always - I welcome any feedback or suggestions. I know folks are typically hesitant to criticize conference sessions or blog posts, but as this is commercial content, I understand expectations are going to be higher.

If you do take the course, and like it, please post a review and rating. Thanks!
