This weekend I'll be speaking at the Adobe Creative Suite User Group. They are having a one day conference in San Francisco called <a href="http://www.meetup.com/creativesuitesanjose/events/41143312/">The Future of Design: Developing for Mobile</a>. I'll be presenting on PhoneGap (and possibly another topic). If you are in town, then check out the event. The cost is ten dollars.
