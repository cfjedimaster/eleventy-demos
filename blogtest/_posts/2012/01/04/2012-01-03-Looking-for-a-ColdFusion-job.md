My former employers, REX Technologies, are looking to hire some folks. It's a great place to work and there's some really smart folks there. For more details, see the details below. (By the way - the contact below, Chris Seim, is my former boss. He was one of the best managers I've had in my career.) 

REX Technologies is looking to increase the size of their ColdFusion development team.  There are multiple Application Developer and Sr. Application Developer positions open.  This is an opportunity to join a skilled ColdFusion development team building an enterprise application for a large insurance company.  We are looking for developers in the following locations:  Omaha NE, Warwick RI, Henderson NV, Tampa FL, or Ontario CA.  Please contact Chris Seim at cseim@riskexchange.com for more information or to apply.
