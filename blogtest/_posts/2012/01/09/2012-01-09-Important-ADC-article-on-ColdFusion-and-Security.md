<img src="https://static.raymondcamden.com/images/ScreenClip15.png" style="float:left" /> Just wanted to pass along a link to a newly published article on the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet.html">Adobe Developer Connection</a> related to ColdFusion and security: <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/coldfusion/articles/coldfusion-securing-apps.html">Securing your applications using HttpOnly cookies with ColdFusion</a> by Pete Freitag.
<p>
You can also take this as your monthly reminder that the ADC is both a) cool and b) worth checking out often!
