A few days ago a buddy of mine asked how to get his CFBuilder 2 serial number. Turns out you can't do that from the IDE itself. I reached out to the engineers and Krishna shared the following tips with me:

<blockquote>
Option 1) Register the product using Adobe ID (Help->Register Adobe ColdFusion Builder...). After sometime, it will be updated in Adobe license database and can be retrieved from 

https://www.adobe.com/account.html

Then click on My products by authenticating with Adobe ID.
You can see your product serial there. This option is only for Retail serial keys.

Option 2)
Contact support. 
</blockquote>

Probably a good idea to copy down all serials anyway. I use Evernote for stuff like this.
