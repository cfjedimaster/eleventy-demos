A few weeks back I <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2012/1/4/Looking-for-a-ColdFusion-job">posted</a> a job notice from my former employers, REX Technologies. Turns out this worked great for them, and they are now looking for QA resources as well:

<blockquote>
REX Technologies is looking to increase the size of their Quality Assurance team. There are multiple Senior Quality Assurance Engineer and Sr. Quality Assurance Engineer positions open. This is an opportunity to join a QA team using ColdFusion, MXUnit, CFSelenium and Jenkins testing large enterprise applications. We are looking for Quality Engineers in the following locations: Omaha NE, Warwick RI, Henderson NV, Tampa FL, or Ontario CA. Please contact David O'Leary at doleary@riskexchange.com for more information or to apply.
</blockquote>

As I said in my previous post, I wholeheartedly recommend REX.
