Just passing this along...

<blockquote>
The Catholic University of America, located in Washington, D.C., is hiring a mid-level web services engineer.  We have a special page for CFMLers that isn't being advertised outside social media at http://computing.cua.edu/about/divisions/iae.cfm.
</blockquote>

Any job offer with this on the page has to be a bit cool...
