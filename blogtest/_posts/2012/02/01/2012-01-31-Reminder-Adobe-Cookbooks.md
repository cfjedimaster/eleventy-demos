As a gentle reminder, don't forget the excellent resource that is the <a href="http://cookbooks.adobe.com/home">Adobe Cookbook</a>, including over 200 <a href="http://cookbooks.adobe.com/coldfusion">ColdFusion Cookbook</a> entries. Looks like it has been a while since content was added, so take this as a gentle push to yall to consider adding something.
