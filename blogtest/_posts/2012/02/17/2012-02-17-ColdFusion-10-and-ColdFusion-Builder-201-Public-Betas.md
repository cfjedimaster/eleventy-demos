The title says it all, the public betas of ColdFusion 10 (AKA Zeus) and ColdFusion Builder 2.0.1 are now available: <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/coldfusion10/">http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/coldfusion10/</a>. Hopefully by now you have a good idea what we've been adding to the product, but now is your chance to try it out yourself!
