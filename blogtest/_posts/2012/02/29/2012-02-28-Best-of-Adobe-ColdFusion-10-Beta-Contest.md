I'm happy to announce that we are running another "Best of ColdFusion" contest to celebrate the public beta release of the next version of <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/coldfusion10/">Adobe ColdFusion 10 (Beta)</a>.

The contest rules are simple: Design an application (and that can be a "real" app, a one page template, even a mobile application driven by ColdFusion on the back end) that highlights a new ColdFusion 10 feature. You can highlight any ColdFusion 10 feature (or features).

Unlike before, contest entries will be shared immediately with everyone via our Facebook page. (URL soon!) You will be able to play with the contest entries. There will still be a series of public blog posts talking about the entries and reviewing them, but you can see right away what other entrants are doing. Even better, you get a chance to help pick the winners.

We will be giving away 2 copies of Adobe ColdFusion 10 Enterprise and Adobe ColdFusion Builder 2.0.1. Two of the winners will be chosen by myself and Rakshith (ColdFusion Product Manager) based on a purely "This is cool!" rating system. The other two winners will be entirely driven by "Likes" on the Facebook page.

As before, this contest is open to anyone and everyone, and all entries must be licensed via an open source license. To submit your entry, please email a zip to raymondcamden@gmail.com.

Participating in the contest constitutes permission to Adobe Systems Incorporated to use the applications created and participants' pictures and/or name and/ or other particulars and /or likeness for the purposes of advertising, trade and promotion of Adobe ColdFusion or otherwise without further compensation and notification to the participant and authorization from the participant.

The contest runs from now until May 1st.
