Next Tuesday I'll be giving an Adobe E-Seminar on ColdFusion 10. This is mainly an updated version of my MAX presentation, but since that video was mysteriously cut in half (I blame the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_alien">Greys</a>), this will serve as another opportunity to take a tour of what's new in ColdFusion 10. I'd be willing to bet that most of my audience here probably doesn't need such a presentation, but you may want to share it with others, management, friends, family, pets, etc, who want a look at the new hotness in ColdFusion.

As always - <b>you must register first</b>. Only then will you be given the golden ticket to the awesomeness that is the sound of my silky smooth voice over the wonders of Adobe Connect. I'll probably tweet the URL a few minutes before the actual presentation, but I'd strongly urge you to register in advance. Even better, you'll get an email reminder of the event beforehand. Imagine that - an electronic missive from the mighty MCP behind the walls of the Adobe firewall of uberness.
