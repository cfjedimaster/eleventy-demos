A few weeks back I got a preview of a product that was incredible, and I'm happy to see that a public preview was launched last night. <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/shadow/">Adobe Shadow</a> is a tool that lets you preview and inspect web sites on multiple mobile devices at once. You can use your desktop to drive the web browser on your iOS <i>and</i> Android devices. That by itself would be useful. But you can then also use a Chrome Dev Tools like inspection and editing feature to tweak the DOM of individual devices. None of this probably sounds nearly as cool as it looks, so take a look at the short video below:

You can download (and discuss) this new tool on the <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/shadow/">Adobe Labs</a> site. You can also follow <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/adobeshadow">Adobe Shadow on Twitter</a> and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/AdobeShadow">Facebook</a>.
