I may be biased, but this is <i>very</i> cool news. Today, fellow evangelist MichaÃ«l Chaize announced the launch of <a href="http://appliness.com/">Appliness</a>, a new, and <b>free</b>, digital magazine specifically written for web application developers. You can read his <a href="http://www.riagora.com/2012/03/appliness-digital-magazine/">blog entry</a> with details on the creation of the magazine, or simply download it yourself. It is available (again, for <b>free</b>) for iOS and Android. It will soon be available in the Amazon store as well. Adobe <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/digital-publishing-suite-family.html">Digital Publishing Suite</a> was used to create the magazine.
