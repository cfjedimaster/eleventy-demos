Late last week Dan Fredericks emailed an interesting question. I honestly had no idea how to even begin to answer it, so I thought I'd share it here and get advice from my incredibly intelligent (and good looking) readers. His question was:
<p>
<blockquote>
I have read over the last couple of days <a href="http://www.bennadel.com/blog/2354-ColdFusion-10-Script-vs-Tags-And-My-Coding-Methodology.htm">Ben's post</a> and <a href="http://www.danvega.org/blog/2012/3/29/Component-output-script-vs-tags">Dan's post</a> about tag vs script for components. I am more comfortable with tags, and so are most of my coworkers. However, the application we work on (CF 8 app), is written in coldbox and the previous developers did a lot of their handler work in script. So, we have developers now that don't work in script, but the code is in script...you can see the mess we are making :)
<p>

so, my question for you, or for the community as a whole, how best to transition from tags for cfc's to script? me personally, when i was converting a foxpro app to CF, i was able to grab some foxpro code and just copy it into a cfscript block and change a bit of it and it worked, but i am still no expert in script, and nobody here is. I was thinking it might be a good think at my job to try to run a small demo on the basics of scripting for CF (obviously cf8 scripting), but I really don't have a good idea about how to go about it.
<p>

are there any demos that you know of already, or do you have any suggestions? or do you think the community would have some?

So this is definitely a fascinating question. I began my web development career with both HTML and JavaScript. When I began doing server side work, it was in Perl. So I had scripting experience from a very early age. Scripting feels very natural to me, even with most of my development career being in a tag based language. Dan's question then threw me for a loop. If your only experience with code was tag-based HTML and ColdFusion, how do you get into scripting?

<p>

You can - of course - make use of the docs that specifically cover scripting in ColdFusion: <a href="http://help.adobe.com/en_US/ColdFusion/9.0/Developing/WSc3ff6d0ea77859461172e0811cbec22c24-7feb.html">Extending ColdFusion Pages with CFML Scripting</a>. These docs walk you through the process of using cfscript. I find that people ignore the official docs far too often, or complain that they have too many errors and omissions in them. As a technical writer, let me just say that I've yet to see any technical book ship without errors. The official docs for ColdFusion are huge and are a resource too rarely utilized.

<p>

Obviously learning another scripting language, <i>especially</i> JavaScript, would be incredibly helpful. Not only would it give you another language to add to your tool chest, it would give you more experience in working within a script based environment.

Ok readers - what would you suggest?
