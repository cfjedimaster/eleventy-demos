If you follow me on Twitter (or any of the PhoneGap accounts) then you already know this, but for folks who may have missed it, <a href="http://www.phonegap.com">PhoneGap</a> is now at version 1.6. I'm unofficially naming this version <a href="http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Borg_Queen">Borg Queen</a>. (Don't ask why - there is no reason.) For full details about what changed, see the team's <a href="http://phonegap.com/2012/04/11/phonegap-1-6-released/">blog post</a>. There are two items in particular you want to pay attention to.

First - there is now a workaround for the iOS 5.1 local storage bug that turned local storage into local nothingness. (Very zen.)

Secondly - the movement towards one unified JavaScript file continues on. There is now one JavaScript file for Android, iOS, and BlackBerry.
