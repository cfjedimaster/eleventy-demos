If you are a developer, designer, or product manager in the Bay Area you should check out this event put on by an old friend of mine: <a href="http://productsarehard.com">Products Are Hard</a>.  Looks like lots of great speakers, including folks from Zynga, YouTube, Clorox, Redfin, Wikipedia, Yammer, and a bunch of others. Those of you from the ColdFusion community may recognize one of the organizers, Nathan Dintenfass, a CF veteran from ancient times.  You can use the discount code "raynation" to get 20% off tickets. (But you must yell, "RAYNATION", at top volume when you enter the conference.)
