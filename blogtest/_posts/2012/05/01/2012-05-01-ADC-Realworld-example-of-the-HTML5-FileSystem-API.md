Yesterday my latest Adobe Developer Connection (*) article was posted - I hope you guys think it is cool: <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/html5/articles/real-world-example-html5-filesystem-api.html">Real-world Example of the HTML5 FileSystem API</a>. As I learn new things, I strive to find real-world (if sometimes contrived) uses for features. This article represents my exploration of the FileSystem API and my attempt to create a real use case for it.

* Not to sound like a broken record (ok, I <i>love</i> to repeat myself, ask my kids), but I'll remind folks again about how awesome the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet.html">Adobe Developer Connection</a> is. If you haven't got it bookmarked, you are missing out on some truly stellar content!
