Next week (Wednesday night) I'll be doing a presentation on ColdFusion 10 and WebSockets for the Salt Lake City ColdFusion User Group. This meeting is open to the public. Details (along with Connect URL) are available here:

If you haven't played with WebSockets yet, this is a perfect opportunity to investigate them and see how easy ColdFusion 10 makes it. How easy?
