Finally. 100% done. (Although Amazon still says it isn't released - that should be corrected soon.) The jQuery Mobile book I wrote with <a href="http://andymatthews.net/">Andy Matthews</a> is now published. The book covers creating jQuery Mobile apps and is up to date to the most recent release. The code is available via Github for easy forking/modifying as you learn. You can purchase via the Amazon link to the left (as I said, it <i>is</i> published so it should ship and I get a small kickback from the affiliate link) or via the <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/jquery-mobile-web-development-essentials/book">Packt site</a>.

I'm a strong believer in jQuery Mobile. It takes an incredible simple, practical direction that I think will be incredibly powerful for developers. If you haven't taken the time to look at the framework, now is a perfect time to check it out.
