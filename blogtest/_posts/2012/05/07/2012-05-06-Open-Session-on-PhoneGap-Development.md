Curious about PhoneGap? Have questions? Tomorrow, <a href="http://www.tricedesigns.com/">Andrew Trice</a> and myself are hosting a 2-hour Adobe Connect session on PhoneGap. This will be an open session for <i>your</i> questions, not a presentation. The Connect URL is: <a href="http://my.adobeconnect.com/adobehtml">http://my.adobeconnect.com/adobehtml</a>. The date/time is Tuesday 1PM CST to 3PM CST (that's 11AM to 1PM PST).
