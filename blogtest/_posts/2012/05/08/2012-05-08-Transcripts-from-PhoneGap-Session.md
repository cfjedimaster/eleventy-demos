First off - a huge thank you to everyone who came to our PhoneGap Open Q and A today. We had more than 50 attendees for most of the two hour block which I think is a great turnout. We even had a troll (for a few minutes), so that means we must be doing something right!

The questions were very interesting. I noticed lots of attention around notifications and push, two areas I've not really dug into yet. I also noticed a few questions on the front-facing camera. (According to <a href="http://www.tricedesigns.com/">Andrew</a>, on devices with two cameras, the native UI should simply prompt you when you request the camera.) 

The Q and A transcript, as well as the more random general chat, are attached as zip files below. 

As always - if you have any feedback about the session concerning how we could improve it, just let me know in the comments below.

p.s. I had a few requests for plain text versions. Here is a plain text version of the <a href="https://gist.github.com/2640834">Q and A</a> and here is a plain text version of the <a href="https://gist.github.com/2640847">chat</a>.<p><a href='enclosures/C{% raw %}%3A%{% endraw %}5Chosts{% raw %}%5C2012%{% endraw %}2Eraymondcamden{% raw %}%2Ecom%{% endraw %}5Cenclosures{% raw %}%2Fsessionlogs%{% endraw %}2Ezip'>Download attached file.</a></p>
