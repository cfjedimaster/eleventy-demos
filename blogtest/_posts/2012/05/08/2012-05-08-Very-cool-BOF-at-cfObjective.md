Just a quick shout out to remember the BOFs (Birds of a Feather) at this year's cfObjective. You can see the full list here: <a href="http://www.cfobjective.com/news/birds-of-a-feather-sessions-announced2/">Birds of a Feather Sessions Announced</a>. While they are all cool, I wanted to call out the CFScript Community Components BOF being run by Sam Farmer. This is a mini-hackathon to help contribute to the <a href="http://fusiongrokker.com/post/be-the-change">community project</a> launched to improve component-based CFScript support. To help sweeten the deal (and improve the code no doubt), Adobe will be providing free drinks at the hotel bar. Now you have no not to attend!
