You can now download the final release of <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion-family.html">ColdFusion 10</a>. There's been a lot of press/blog entries/presentations/videos already on this release so I won't repeat the feature list, but you can see even more new videos on <a href="http://tv.adobe.com/product/coldfusion/">Adobe TV</a>.
