First off - a big thank you to everyone who attended my presentation at cfObjective today. I hope it was a useful introduction to some of the cool new stuff in HTML5. That sounds really lame, but it's honestly how I feel. The web (well the front end) is <i>incredibly</i> fun again. I'm hoping to do many more presentations in the future, but with a more focused topic. I'm doing a presentation soon on HTML5 Storage options and I'm planning one just on Forms. (Since, you know, forms are kind of important. Unlike other things. Looking at you Canvas.)

You can download the presentation and code from Github: <a href="https://github.com/cfjedimaster/HTML-Code-Demos">https://github.com/cfjedimaster/HTML-Code-Demos</a>

It should "just run" in your browser, but some of the demos are a bit bleeding edge.
