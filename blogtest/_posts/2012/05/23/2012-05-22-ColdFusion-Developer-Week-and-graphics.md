As announced on the <a href="http://blogs.coldfusion.com/post.cfm/coldfusion-developer-week-is-back-4th-and-8th-june-2012">Adobe ColdFusion</a> blog, ColdFusion Developer Week is back. This is an entire week of online ColdFusion presentations from experts in our community. The best part? It's entirely free! Sign up via the link above. 

Also - I've attached a zip to this blog entry with official logo graphics for ColdFusion and ColdFusion Builder. 

<b>EDIT:</b> Joe Brislin kindly gave me both a Windows and Mac icon file you can use for your CFBuilder or other needs. The zip includes his zip bundled in. Thanks Joe!
