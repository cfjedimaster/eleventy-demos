For some time now I've complained that I couldn't quite get why <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a> was so popular. Don't get me wrong - I like JavaScript. But every time I saw a demo it was the same damn thing again and again. A web server. This put me off and made me much less inclined to look deeper at the language. You see - one of the things I don't get about some of the other "cool kids" compared to ColdFusion is that they don't seem to have great support for web applications. The languages seem cool. I played some with Ruby and found it to be <i>very</i> neat. But what I didn't get is why web stuff was a) either an afterthought or b) left to various other open source frameworks that you were supposed to just know about. To me - ColdFusion has always been a great platform for both the language and what it did outside of the language. Application support. Simple sessions. Sure, I can't use it to build a desktop application or a native mobile site - but I could certainly use it to build a data layer for it. Fair or not - that was the perspective by which I judged other languages like Node and Ruby.

I think - though - I was being pretty close minded. First - I learned more about Node from <a href="http://www.simb.net/category/technology/">Sim Bateman</a> at cfObjective. He demonstrated using Node beyond just simple web pages and how it could complement an existing web application platform like ColdFusion.

Next I read this <a href="http://www.andymatthews.net/read/2012/05/29/Unit-Testing-jQuery-Plugins-with-Grunt-and-QUnit">excellent post</a> by Andy Matthews about unit testing with Grunt. What surprised me was how npm, a Node package manager, actually was able to install an executable script to my system. All of a sudden I could see myself using this Node-related tool to complement my HTML5/ColdFusion/whatever applications. 

And then - literally like an hour or two later - I read <a href="http://blog.pamelafox.org/2012/05/using-gruntjs-with-css.html">this post</a> by Pamela Fox about how she uses the same tool as part of her build process.

To be clear - I have no objections to learning another web-based product. I love ColdFusion. But other cool tools out there exist. But I made a big mistake in thinking of Node as just a ColdFusion alternative. 

Forgive me - I can be a bit slow. ;)
