Welcome to ColdFusion Developer Week. It is not too late to register (which is free and required to get the Connect URLs) so get to it!

<a href="http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/event/index.cfm?event=detail&id=2021647&loc=en_us">ColdFusion 10 Developer Week</a>

I'll be presenting today on WebSockets and doing a general 'intro' class on Thursday.
