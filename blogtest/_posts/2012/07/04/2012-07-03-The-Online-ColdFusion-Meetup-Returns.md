After a short break, the Online ColdFusion Meetup returns with a new meeting, <a href="http://www.meetup.com/coldfusionmeetup/events/71721342/?a=ea1_grp&rv=ea1">"Multi-Factor Authentication in ColdFusion", with Denard Springle</a>. If you have never attended one of these meetings (I hope all of my readers have attended at least one!) then this is an excellent opportunity to start. These are <b>totally free, online</b> meetings you can attend in your underwear. No excuses!
