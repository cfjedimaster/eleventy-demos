This week I'll be speaking at a combined event of the Nashville PHP User Group and the Interactive Developers of Nashville. I'll be speaking on two topics. First I'm going to give a basic introduction to <a href="http://www.phonegap.com">PhoneGap</a>. Then I'll be following it up with a discussion on debugging web applications. This will be Tuesday night at 6PM. You can find more details here: <a href="http://www.idofnashville.com/events/68154052/?eventId=68154052&action=detail">Real-world PhoneGap and mobile apps - tips, tricks and debugging</a>. I'll be giving away a copy of Creative Suite 6 as well.
