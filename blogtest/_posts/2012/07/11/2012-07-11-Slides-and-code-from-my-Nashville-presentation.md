Thank you to everyone who attended my marathon session last night in Nashville. You can download the slide deck (Keynote and PDF) and code from the Github links below. For those who were not there, you are, of course, welcome to take a look as well, but without my silky smooth speaking voice behind the slides it may not be as exciting.
