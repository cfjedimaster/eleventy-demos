Thank you to everyone who showed up for my RIACon presentations. Any feedback, positive or negative, would be greatly appreciated. I've attached the code and slide deck for the jQuery Mobile presentation to this blog post (link at the bottom). The resources for my HTML5 presentation may be found on Github: <a href="https://github.com/cfjedimaster/html5-storage">https://github.com/cfjedimaster/html5-storage</a><p><a href='enclosures/C{% raw %}%3A%{% endraw %}5Chosts{% raw %}%5C2012%{% endraw %}2Eraymondcamden{% raw %}%2Ecom%{% endraw %}5Cenclosures{% raw %}%2FArchive27%{% endraw %}2Ezip'>Download attached file.</a></p>
