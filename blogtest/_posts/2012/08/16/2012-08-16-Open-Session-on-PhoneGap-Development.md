<img src="https://static.raymondcamden.com/images/phonegap_logo.png" style="float:left;margin-right:10px;" /> A few months back <a href="http://www.tricedesigns.com/">Andrew Trice</a> and I held an open session on PhoneGap development. Basically we opened up a Connect room to the public and answered any and all questions related to PhoneGap. We will be holding another one of these sessions on August 28th at 10AM PST. The session will run for two hours. I'll be spending about ten minutes or so at the beginning demonstrating a few new things (in case you missed them - those PhoneGap devs are busy!) but after that it will be purely driven by your questions. The meeting will be held at the same URL as before: <a href="http://my.adobeconnect.com/adobehtml">http://my.adobeconnect.com/adobehtml</a>. I'm also happy to announce that fellow evangelist <a href="http://outof.me/">Piotr Walczyszyn</a> will be joining us.
