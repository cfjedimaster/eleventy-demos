In about two weeks I'll be speaking twice in Omaha. On September 5th at 7PM, I'll be speaking at the <a href="http://www.necfug.com/">Nebraska ColdFusion User Group</a>. I'll be giving a presentation on HTML5 Storage methods.

On the next day, I'll be presenting at <a href="http://www.heartlanddc.com/">HDC</a>. Also speaking from Adobe are Terry Ryan and Kevin Hoyt. I'll be speaking on JavaScript/HTML debugging techniques. 

Hope to see you there!
