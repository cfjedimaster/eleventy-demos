Quick Friday afternoon post for you:

First - check out Adam Cameron's blog post on <a href="http://adamcameroncoldfusion.blogspot.co.uk/2012/08/coldfusion-modularisation.html">ColdFusion Modularisation</a>. He is looking for feedback on some ideas in regards to how ColdFusion could possibly become more modularized. And if you haven't yet subscribed to his blog - you should. Adam is probably one of the best ColdFusion user/testers/critics we have out there.

Secondly - Daniel Garcia wanted me to let you know about a new ColdFusion User Group he is lauching in the Chicagoland area: <a href="http://www.ccfug.org">Chicagoland ColdFusion User Group</a>. Don't forget you can find <i>any</i> Adobe-related user group at <a href="http://groups.adobe.com">Adobe Groups</a>.
