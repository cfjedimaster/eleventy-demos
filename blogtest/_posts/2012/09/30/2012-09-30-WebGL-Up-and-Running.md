<img src="https://static.raymondcamden.com/images/lrg.jpg" style="float:left;margin-right:5px" /> I had the distinct pleasure of reading <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920024729.do#">WebGL: Up and Running</a> from O'Reilly. I'll be honest and say a lot of the mathematics was a bit hard to grok, but I never truly understood how powerful WebGL was before I read this book. It makes anything Canvas can do look pretty tame. <a href="http://caniuse.com/#search=webgl">Support</a> is a bit low right now (partially supported around 50%), but its worthwhile to take a look at it now. At minimum, use it as a way to warm up those old Math-related muscles in your brain. I'd love to know if any of my readers out there are using WebGL yet. Anyone?
