One more reason <a href="http://www.ncdevcon.com">NCDevCon</a> is a cool conference is that they record, and share, <i>all</i> of the content online. If you missed the conference, or couldn't attend a session because another cool one was at the same time, now is your chance to catch up.

You can view the entire library here: <a href="http://textiles.online.ncsu.edu/online/Catalog/pages/catalog.aspx?catalogId=35211b84-031b-4a18-8875-506f09b9b3a7">http://textiles.online.ncsu.edu/online/Catalog/pages/catalog.aspx?catalogId=35211b84-031b-4a18-8875-506f09b9b3a7</a>

Here are my sessions, specifically, in order of how well dressed I was when presenting:

p.s. The underwear thing was optional.<br/>
p.p.s. To be clear - please - wear underwear - but you don't need to watch the presentations in your underwear.<br/>
p.p.p.s. For the love of God - if you do - please don't tell me. Thanks. Bye.
