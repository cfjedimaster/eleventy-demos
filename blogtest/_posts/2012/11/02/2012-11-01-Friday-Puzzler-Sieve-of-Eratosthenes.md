It's been a <i>long</i> time since I posted a Friday Puzzler, but as I was perusing <a href="http://www.khanacademy.org">Khan's</a> CS courses this morning (which look <b>really</b> cool!) I came across this fascinating discourse on prime numbers: <a href="http://www.khanacademy.org/cs/level-4-sieve-of-eratosthenes/1096543070">Sieve of Eratosthenes</a>. 

Your challenge today is simple - watch the video (via the link above or embed below) - and once the theory is discussed, do <b>not</b> look at the full solution. Write up a solution in ColdFusion and post your answer below. Please remember to use a Gist or Pastebin link.

As a prize today I can offer four gold badges, two Klout perks, and a couple Facebook likes.
