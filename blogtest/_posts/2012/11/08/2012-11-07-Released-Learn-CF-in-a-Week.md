This is pretty big news folks. For a while now, various members of the ColdFusion community, led by Simon Free, have been working on a new educational resource for CF developers. It is now live at: <a href="http://www.learncfinaweek.com/">http://www.learncfinaweek.com/</a>. 

The material covers 15 chapters on topics ranging from ORM, security and even internationalization. You can view the material online or download it as a PDF or eBook version.

To make it even sweeter - this is also 100% free!
