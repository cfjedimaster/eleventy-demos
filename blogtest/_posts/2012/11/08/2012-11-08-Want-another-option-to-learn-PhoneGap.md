ColdFusion community member and all around smart guy Matt Gifford has released a new book for PhoneGap developers: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1849518580/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1849518580&linkCode=as2&tag=raymondcamden-20">PhoneGap Mobile Application Development Cookbook (affiliate link)</a>. I was a reviewer for the book and can definitely recommend it. It's chock full of good, practical demonstrations.
