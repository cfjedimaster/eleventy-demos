Looks like O'Reilly just released the ebook for HTML5 Hacks, a new book consisting of 500 pages of great HTML5 hacks for everything from geolocation to CSS3. The book was written by Jesse Cravens and Jeff Burtoft, but also included other authors... like myself! For me, this was a great opportunity. I've been published before, but having something in an O'Reilly book is - well - different. You can pick the <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920026273.do?sortby=bestSellers">ebook now</a> or use the Amazon link below. (Note, I get a small kickback of a few pennies per purchase, so buy a couple copies! ;)
