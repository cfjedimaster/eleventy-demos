I'm a bit late passing this on, but Luis Majano asked if I would share the holiday contest being run for ContentBox. <a href="http://www.gocontentbox.org">ContentBox</a> is an open source CMS solution written in ColdFusion. The contest involves writing a module or theme for ContentBox. Prizes include a new Kindle! For details, see their blog post:
