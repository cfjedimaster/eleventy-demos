Ok, so maybe I'm a bit biased, but I think anyone would be lucky to live and work in Lafayette, Louisiana. There's a festival every 5 days. Pleasant weather (triple digits means three times the fun), affordable cost of living, minimal gator attacks. Oh, and <a href="http://lusfiber.com/">fiber</a> to the home. (50 bucks a month for 40 Mbps up and down!) Apex Innovators asked me to pass along this job opening and I was glad to do so.
