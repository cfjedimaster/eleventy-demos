I somehow missed this the past 6 years (sigh), but <a href="http://24ways.org">24 Ways</a> launches its 2012 web development advent calendar tomorrow. You can check the previous years to see if the content is something you would be interested in. It looks like a great mix of developer and designer-oriented articles.
