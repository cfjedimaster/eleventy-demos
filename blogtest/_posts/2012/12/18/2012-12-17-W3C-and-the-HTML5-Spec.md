Yesterday the W3C (Worldwide Web Consortium) finalized the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/CR-html5-20121217/">HTML5 spec</a>. This isn't the final final version, but is the "feature complete" version, and frankly, is a good step forward. Those of you who did the extra credit homework in school should go ahead and start reading up on <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-html51-20121217/">HTML 5.1</a>!
