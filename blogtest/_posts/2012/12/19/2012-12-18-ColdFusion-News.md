I try to avoid "go see this link" posts, but when it comes to important news, I like to ensure my blog readers are in the know. (I don't want to assume everyone is on Twitter!) A few days ago Rakshith, ColdFusion Product Manager, posted some important news about ColdFusion:

<a href="http://blogs.coldfusion.com/post.cfm/coldfusion-news-initiatives-and-updates-from-adobe">ColdFusion: News, Initiatives and Updates from Adobe</a>

The post covers the business, education initiatives, and the possibility of a new Adobe-created ColdFusion conference. Check the post for details. 

p.s. As a reminder - you should post your comments there, not here.

p.p.s. I still think the ColdFusion Next code names sound too much like 80s X-Men...
