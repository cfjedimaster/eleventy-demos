I apologize for this being a slow blog week. I had hoped for lots of free time to play, I mean experiment, but it turned out I had presentations to do and prepare for.  I wanted to share this as it just came up on Twitter and I recognize that not everyone subscribes to the whole "Let's be distracted all day" thing. Here are email newsletters that I recommend my readers consider. They all come once a week so they won't spam your inbox, and I can say that even with me using Google Reader, Twitter, Google+, etc, that I normally find <i>multiple</i> cool things that I missed. 

<ul>
<li><a href="http://javascriptweekly.com/">JavaScript Weekly</a> (with one of my articles in it this week so you <i>have</i> to subscribe! ;)</li>
<li><a href="http://css-weekly.com/">CSS Weekly</a></li>
<li><a href="http://html5weekly.com/">HTML5 Weekly</a></li>
<li><a href="http://tinyletter.com/cfml">CFML Weekly</a></li>
<li><a href="http://appendto.com/modernwebobserver/">The Modern Web Observer</a> (a new one!)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Edits: As I find new ones I'll add them here. Keeping it separate just so folks can know what I've changed.
