Just an FYI - if you want to catch me live (or virtual in some cases), here is where, and what, I'll be speaking on this month.

<ul>
<li>Next week I'll be in Sandusky, Ohio to speak at <a href="http://codemash.org/">CodeMash</a>. I'm doing a 4 hour presentation/lab on PhoneGap.</li>
<li>On January 15th, myself and other Adobe Evangelists will be hosting an online version of the Create the Web tour. Details may be found <a href="http://techlive.adobe.com/ai1ec_event/create-the-web-2/?instance_id=631">here</a>.
<li>On January 16th I'm presenting to <a href="http://www.meetup.com/IndyFusion/">IndyFusion</a>, the Adobe User Group for Indianapolis. This will be a Connect meeting where I'm giving an overview of ColdFusion 10. (As with all my Connect to User Group meetings, I may, or may not, share the Connect URL. It depends on the group and if it makes sense.)</li>
<li>On January 17th I'll be doing another open PhoneGap session with Andrew Trice. This is also part of the new TechLive site. Details may be found <a href="http://techlive.adobe.com/ai1ec_event/open-phonegap-session/?instance_id=629">here</a>.</li>
<li>On January 23rd, again via the TechLive site, I'm giving my presentation on HTML5 Storage techniques. Details may be found <a href="http://techlive.adobe.com/ai1ec_event/html5-storage/?instance_id=621">here</a>.</li>
<li>Finally, I'll be traveling to San Francisco for <a href="http://mobilewebdevconference.com/">Mobile+Web DevCon</a>. This is held January 29th through 31st. I'm giving a 3 hour session on JavaScript development (<a href="http://mobilewebdevconference.com/san-francisco-2013/agenda/day-one/100-400d.html">Designers Can't Do JavaScript!</a>) and a one hour session on IndexedDB.</li>
</ul>
