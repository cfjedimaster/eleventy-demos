Just passing this along...

Web Database Application Developer

Because of our growth, we're adding an additional full?time position to our Web Development team.

Our current systems use Adobe Flash, Flex, and ColdFusion and we are moving applications over to HTML5, AJAX, JavaScript & jQuery. We use MS SQL Server Enterprise for database backend. Applicants need to have basic to intermediate understanding of SQL, and have knowledge of a set of tools for developing web database applications.  Our applications focus on data collection as well as data visualization, presentation, and reporting.  What's fun and challenging in the area we work is that our customers vary from community?based organizations to researchers at CDC. Figuring out how to have data make sense to the various groups so that they can use the data to plan programs and prevent the spread of disease is very challenging. It's also rewarding knowing we're helping our customers prevent the spread of disease. Our customers are really cool people who are very patient, but who have very complex needs. We foresee increased focus on developing novel ways for users to interact with the data collected by our systems. You would join two full?time programmers, two network engineers, four technical support staff, and a User Experience and Testing lead.

Applications are welcome from individuals with experience, new graduates, and those who expect to graduate in May 2012  Please send resumes or questions to info@lutherconsulting.com.
