Would you like a free copy of the <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/phonegap-mobile-application-development-cookbook/book">PhoneGap Mobile Application Development Cookbook</a>? Packt has reached out to me to let me share <b>five</b> copies of the book to my readers. (People in the US, the UK, or Europe can choose a physical or electronic copy. Everyone else must select an electronic copy.) 

To win, check out the book's <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/phonegap-mobile-application-development-cookbook/book">product page</a>, check out the details, and simply tell me which chapter you think sounds the most interesting and why. (Use the comments below.) 

I'll use completely unfair and arbitrary methods to select 5 winners by January 20th.
