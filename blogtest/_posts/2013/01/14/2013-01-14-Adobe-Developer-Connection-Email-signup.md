My readers here know that I tend to push (rather heavily) the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet.html">Adobe Developer Connection</a>. Even with me being an ardent supporter of the site I still miss articles from time to time. Brian Rinaldi today launched a semi-official email subscription service for the ADC. To be clear, his email service focuses on just the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PhoneGap and web standards articles, but I imagine most of my readers aren't interested in the Photoshop articles. To sign up, just click here: <a href="http://bit.ly/10uPqEn">http://bit.ly/10uPqEn</a>
