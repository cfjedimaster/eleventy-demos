A big thank you to everyone who attended the open PhoneGap session today. We had some technical difficulties with the handling of questions, but over all, it was a great session. My coworker <a href="http://www.tricedesigns.com/">Andy Trice</a> posted the transcript up in a Gist. You can get the raw text <a href="https://gist.github.com/raw/4558113/b4fd75202f1b2c07f73b8cf885ec44ff6dba05b6/gistfile1.html">here</a> or view it in the embed below.
