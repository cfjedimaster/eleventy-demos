I'm still at a conference in San Francisco, but I thought I'd post up the links to my last two presentations. These links are both on Github and include an HTML-based slide deck and demos. The JavaScript Lab one will be pretty useless probably without me presenting it, but the IndexedDB one has a set of demos that slowly build up. I think these could be useful for folks looking for some simple examples of the technology.

For folks interested in learning about IndexedDB, I'll be giving the same presentation online via Adobe TechLive on February 28th. Details <a href="http://techlive.adobe.com/ai1ec_event/using-indexeddb-for-fun-and-profit-mostly-fun/?instance_id=671">here</a>.
