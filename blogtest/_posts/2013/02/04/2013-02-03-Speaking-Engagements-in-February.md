Just a quick run down of my speaking engagements for February.

<ul>
<li>On the 13th (the day after Mardi Gras), I'll be presenting an introduction to PhoneGap to the Chicagoland CFUG. If this is open to the public, I'll share the Connect URL the day of.</li>
<li>On the 14th, myself and other evangelists will be doing another "open" PhoneGap session. This is <b>not</b> a slide and demo presentation but a question and answer session. This will be done over Connect and is open to everyone.
