This is pretty cool. While not an official Adobe project, <a href="http://www.opendevicelab.com">OpenDeviceLab.com</a> is a site that any mobile developer will want to check out. The idea is simple. Given that there are approximately ten trillion different mobile devices (that number may be plus or minus a few million), it becomes incredibly difficult to adequately test across a sizable portion of devices. Other times you simply want to test on a particular platform for one particular bug and don't want to spend money for something you won't use again. The ODL concept makes this easier by creating a database of sites where shared devices can be used. The site also include a map that lets you filter by device manufacturer. Check it out!
