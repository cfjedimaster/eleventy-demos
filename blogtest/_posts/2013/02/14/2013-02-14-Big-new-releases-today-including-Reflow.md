Today we announced some updates and additions to our <a href="http://html.adobe.com/edge/">Edge Tools</a> lineup. As a reminder, everything here is part of the Creative Cloud lineup, and you can <a href="https://creative.adobe.com/join/starter?promoid=KAMVW">sign up</a> for <b>free</b> to get these tools <b>right now</b>. 

First up is <a href="http://html.adobe.com/edge/reflow/">Reflow</a>. I had the pleasure of demoing Reflow at my "Create the Web" tour stops, and this was the application folks were more excited about. Unfortunately, we couldn't share this with you till now. Today, the first preview release of Reflow is available. For an in depth review of the tool, please see the <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/edgereflow/2013/02/14/introducing-adobe-edge-reflow/">team's blog post</a>, but honestly, you need to download this bad boy and try it yourself. I don't pretend to be a designer, but I've found Reflow to be a killer way to visualize and try out responsive designs. You can read about responsive all day long, but Reflow lets you actually <i>build</i> it and see for yourself. Definitely check this out.

Next up is an update to <a href="http://html.adobe.com/edge/animate/">Edge Animate</a>. This tool allows you to build HTML/JavaScript-based animations using a tool much like the Flash IDE. Today version 1.5 was released and brings features like CSS filters, gradients, and support for <a href="http://html.adobe.com/edge/webfonts/">Edge Web Fonts</a>. You can see more about the update (and watch some demonstration videos) on their <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/edge/2013/02/14/adobe-edge-animate-1-5-is-here-bringing-new-design-capabilities-to-the-web/">blog post</a>.

Both <a href="http://brackets.io">Brackets</a> and <a href="http://html.adobe.com/edge/code">Edge Code</a> were updated today as well. Brackets is now on Sprint 20 and Edge Code has been updated to Preview 3. Check the <a href="http://download.brackets.io/">downloads</a> page for Brackets for details on Sprint 20 and read this <a href="http://forums.adobe.com/docs/DOC-3051">forum post</a> for information about Edge Code Preview 3.

Finally, Dreamweaver has also been updated. Changes include Edge Web Font integration and better fluid grid support. More details <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/dreamweaver/2013/02/dreamweaver-creative-cloud-update-feb-2013.html">here</a>.
