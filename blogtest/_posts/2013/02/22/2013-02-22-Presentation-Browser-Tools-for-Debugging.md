A <b>huge</b> thank you goes to <a href="http://www.tricedesigns.com/">Andrew Trice</a> for spending <i>hours</i> on polishing and editing a video of my last presentation. He uploaded it to Youtube and now you guys can watch it as well. I'm proud of this presentation so I hope it is helpful. As always, criticism is welcome. You can download the demos and slide deck here:
