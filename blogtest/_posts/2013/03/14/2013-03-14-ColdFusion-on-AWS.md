I'm a bit late on this (hey, I was in an airplane!), but ColdFusion is now available on Amazon Web Services. You can read the details <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion-family/coldfusion-amazon-web-services.html">here</a>. The AMI clocks in at 15 cents an hour for large instances and 30 cents for extra-large instances. Available operating systems are Windows 2008 R2 and Ubuntu 12.0.4.
