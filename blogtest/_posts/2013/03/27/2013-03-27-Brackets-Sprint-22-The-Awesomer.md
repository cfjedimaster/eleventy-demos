I've been blogging/demonstrating/raving a lot over the past months about <a href="http://brackets.io">Brackets</a>. As cool as it is, it is definitely "in development" and probably not ready to replace your default editor. My normal editor is Sublime Text 2. But a few weeks ago I noticed something. I was using Sublime and expected something to work that was a Brackets feature. For me, Brackets had crossed that line (and that line is probably different for everybody) from being my secondary editor to being my primary editor. I'm not saying that will be true for everyone, but if you have been holding off giving Brackets a try, now may be the time to give it a try.

Sprint 22 includes multiple new features. You can read more about them over on the Brackets blog: <a href="http://blog.brackets.io/2013/03/27/brackets-sprint-22-build/">Brackets Sprint 22</a>

My personal favorite though is the new extension installer. I created a video that demonstrates this feature.
