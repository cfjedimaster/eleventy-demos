I'm happy to announce that you can now purchase the latest edition of the CFWACK, volume 10. The link below gives me a small kick back so if you do plan on buying, I'd appreciate you using the link. CFWACK10 was written by a host of ColdFusion super stars including Ben Forta, Charlie Arehart, Rob Brooks-Bilson, Kenneth Fricklas, Hemant Khandelwal, Chandan Kumar, and yours truly. Technically it isn't shipping for 9 more days, but order now. Multiple copies! One for your mother!
