Yesterday while on the road (ok, technically, in the air), I thought it might be kind of cool if there was a "library" of common JSON responses. I've used AJAX mocking services before (hell, I've even <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2012/12/13/Another-proof-of-concept--MockData">built</a> one), but if you don't know the "form" of a remote service, then you can't really mock it, right? To be honest, there probably aren't that many services out there that people need to mock, but if you had an example JSON packet you could use right away, I kinda thought that might be useful.

I've created a new project on GitHub for this: <a href="https://github.com/cfjedimaster/ServiceDataFormatLibrary">ServiceDataFormatLibrary</a>. It has a grand total of one example so far, but I figured I'd put it out there and see who wants to help flesh it out.
