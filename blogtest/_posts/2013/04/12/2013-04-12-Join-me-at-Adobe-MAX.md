Still not sure if you're going to Adobe MAX this year? Check out my sessions below:

<a href="https://bit.ly/XmPVJt">Working Faster and Smarter with Edge Inspect</a>

<a href="https://bit.ly/Vyu97L">Debugging Your Web Apps</a>

<a href="https://bit.ly/Wc52VD">Advanced PhoneGap Build</a>

Or just check out the entire catalog <a href="https://www.adobe-max.com/scheduler/catalog.do">here</a>. I think we've got a great lineup this year and some <i>really</i> <a href="http://max.adobe.com/speakers.html?scid=social6904564">cool speakers</a>.

Finally, if the price is a sticking point for you, you can register using the code MXSM13 for 300 dollars off. Every time you do this, a piece of chocolate cake is overnight Fedexed to my house. Don't hold back - sign up today!

p.s. Oh, and apparently a little band called the Black Keys will be there too...
