Attending MAX? Or going to be in LA at the same time? Use <a href="http://brackets.io">Brackets</a> or <a href="http://www.phonegap.com">PhoneGap</a>? Both teams will be hosting a hackathon on Monday and Tuesday from 1 to 6PM. A MAX ticket is <strong>not</strong> required to attend. There will be free wifi and a comfy place to sit. While a MAX badge isn't required, if you are not registering for MAX you <strong>must</strong> register on the EventBrite site. For more details, see <a href="http://dev.brackets.io/hack/adobemax/">http://dev.brackets.io/hack/adobemax/</a>. No prior experience required!
