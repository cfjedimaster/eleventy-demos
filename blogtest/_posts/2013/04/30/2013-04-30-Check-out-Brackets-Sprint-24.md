I don't normally do a blog post for new <a href="http://brackets.io">Brackets</a> releases, but I wanted to specifically call out the most recent release, Sprint 24. From the web site, this release includes:
<!--more-->
<ul>
<li>New Quick View: Use your mouse to hover over color, gradient and image values for an in-editor preview.
<li>New Quick Docs for CSS: Press Ctrl+K or Cmd+K on a CSS property to view community generated documentation powered by WebPlatform.org.
<li>Advanced JavaScript Code Intelligence: New JavaScript code intelligence based on the Tern projet. Increased code hinting accuracy, camelCase support and built-in intelligence for RequireJS and jQuery.
<li>Jump To Definition: Instantly locate a function or property definition in your project by pressing Ctrl+J or Cmd+J.
<li>Function Argument / Signature Hints: Press Ctrl+Space inside a function call's ()s to see information on its arguments and their types.
<li>New Project Panel Design: Visual updates to the project panel.
<li>Install Extensions From Toolbar: Install extensions directly from the toolbar.
</ul>

Here's an example of the Quick Docs support for CSS:

And a shot of the hover in-editor preview:

But let me pretend I'm Kanye for a moment and talk about the feature I'm <i>really</i> psyched about - the new JavaScript code intelligence. Currently it is only supported in JS files (i.e., not script blocks on a page), but it is amazing how well it works. I was working on a Backbone project last week and the difference in this new engine has truly made a difference in my editing. The previous sprint was the first sprint where I moved to Brackets for a majority of my coding. This sprint just cements it. 

Remember, you can try this out for yourself, right now, for free, at <a href="http://download.brackets.io/">http://download.brackets.io/</a>.
