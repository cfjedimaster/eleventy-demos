I've never understood the appeal of "unboxing videos". Don't get me wrong - I love to get new tech and I love the open it up and play with it. But watching someone else do that? Lame. But I just had to share my own personal experience with this. After my first MAX presentation today (demo assets will be posted tomorrow, sorry, this was far cooler), a woman walked up to me and handed me her "business card". Here is what she gave me:

And the flip side:

The flip side was part note, part contact info (I erased the phone number):

And finally - some trinkets:
