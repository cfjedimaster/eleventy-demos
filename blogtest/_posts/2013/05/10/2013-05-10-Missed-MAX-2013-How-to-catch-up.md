 This year was my second MAX as an employee and was both exciting - and pretty tiring. If you weren't able to make it though there is an easy way to catch what you missed.

<h2>Keynotes</h2>

Monday's keynote was focused on our product announcements and featured our first hardware announcements ever - Mighty and Napoleon. If you haven't heard yet, Creative Suite is now Creative Cloud. You can find out more at the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/creativecloud/faq.html">FAQ</a> or feel free to just ask me.

By the way - the hardware announcements were a <i>complete</i> surprise to me!

Tuesday's keynote was cool as well. It focused on four different creatives discussing their process and showcasing their work.

<h2>Sneaks</h2>

There isn't a filtered list of the sneaks yet, and it looks like they aren't even all online (there were 12 total), but if you go to the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/AdobeCreativeCloud">AdobeCreativeCloud</a> channel on YouTube, you can find a playlist called <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD8AMy73ZVxXRHZvcj5WvsMopeNMcL_so">Adobe Max 2013</a>. In this playlist are 6 of the 12 sneaks. Unfortunately, both of the Brackets sneaks are not there. I'm going to do a separate blog post on Brackets and what was sneaked later.

<h2>Sessions</h2>

Finally, you can view most, but not all, of the sessions, on Adobe TV: <a href="http://tv.adobe.com/show/max-2013">MAX 2013 - The Creativity Conference</a>. <strong>Note:</strong> Not all of the sessions are available currently. For example, two of mine are still being encoded. (I'll blog when each one becomes available.) But there's quite a bit ready now and some damn interesting stuff there. (And to be clear, some great <i>developer</i> content!)
