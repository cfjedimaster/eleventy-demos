Ok, maybe "poetic" is a bit much... but you can listen to my Nerd Radio interview here:

<a href="http://blog.nerdradio.com/post/50118970743/max-day-3-ray-camden-and-stupid-questions">MAX Day 3: Ray Camden and Stupid Questions</a>
<blockquote>
Ray Camden, Adobe Creative Cloud Evangelist, talks with us about his sessions at MAX covering topics like PhoneGap Build and web development tools.
</blockquote>

Thanks to Leif and and Garth for inviting me!
