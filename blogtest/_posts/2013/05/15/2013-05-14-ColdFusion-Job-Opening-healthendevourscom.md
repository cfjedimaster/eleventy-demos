Passing it on...

<blockquote>
My name is Derek Bowes and I used to run whousescoldfusion.com and twitter is @whousescf.

I am currently working for healthendeavors.com and our Health Care application uses CF10 with SQL 2008. We need more CF developers and are having a hard time finding good ones. They need to be on site in our Scottsdale, AZ office and we would be willing to pay to relocate the right candidate (US relocation only). Need someone mid-senior, with jQuery and JavaScript.

If you could put the word out, it would be greatly appreciated.

I can be reached at derek@healthendeavors.com.
