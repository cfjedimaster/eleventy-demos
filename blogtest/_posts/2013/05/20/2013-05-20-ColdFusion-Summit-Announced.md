I'm totally stealing this content from the <a href="http://blogs.coldfusion.com">official ColdFusion blog</a>, but as it is good news I think I'm allowed. The ColdFusion Summit, a ColdFusion conference organized by Adobe's ColdFusion team, is now officially announced. Details:

October 24th and 25th

<a href="http://www.mandalaybay.com/">Manadalay Bay Resort & Casino</a>, Las Vegas, Nevada

Registration cost: $250

Each paid registration will receive a FREE copy of ColdFusion Builder (MSRP value of $299!)
