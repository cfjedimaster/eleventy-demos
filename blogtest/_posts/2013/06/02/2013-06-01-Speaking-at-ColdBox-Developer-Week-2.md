<img src="https://static.raymondcamden.com/images/ColdBoxLogoSquare_1251.png" style="float:left;margin-right:10px;margin-bottom:10px" /> Very happy to announce that I'll be speaking at <a href="http://www.coldbox.org/cbdw">ColdBox Developer Week 2</a>. This is an online, <strong>free</strong> conference with over 20 hours of material. My session will be on PhoneGap, so not technically ColdBox related, but if you've never taken a look at the platform this is a great opportunity to see what it is all about. You can see details about my specific session <a href="http://www.coldbox.org/cbdw/sessions/17">here</a>.
