I know a few of you are tired (as I am) after staying up last night for the launch of <a href="http://creative.adobe.com">Creative Cloud</a>. If you haven't kept up to date, the Creative Cloud (CC) is the new version of our Creative Suite. Creative Cloud gives you access to over thirty different applications and services, including <i>hundreds</i> of new features to products like Photoshop, Illustrator, Dreamweaver, and the Edge tools.

Pricing options include versions for individuals, teams, enterprises, and education. You can also sign up for free to get trials and download preview versions of some of the applications. (The free membership also gives you 2 gigs of storage space!) You can see details here: <a href="https://creative.adobe.com/plans">https://creative.adobe.com/plans</a>

Even better, it is now much easier to actually install these applications. The new desktop application gives you one click access to installing new applications as well as handling updates.

Along with simplifying installation and updates, the desktop tool gives you a history of your actions and integrates with <a href="http://www.behance.net">Behance</a>. Soon it will provide for file syncing and <a href="http://help.typekit.com/customer/portal/articles/1189216">Typekit desktop fonts</a>. 

But what if you don't even know how to use these new tools? Today we also launched over <strong>200</strong> new videos. These are great for both old and new users alike. 

I plan on blogging more later about some of my favorite tools (Reflow, Inspect, Code) but would love to hear any questions (or comments) about any of the tools.
