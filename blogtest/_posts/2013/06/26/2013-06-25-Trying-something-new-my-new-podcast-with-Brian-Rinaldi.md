Ok, I'll be honest folks. I've no idea how well this will be received, but <a href="http://www.remotesynthesis.com/">Brian Rinaldi</a> and I have started a new podcast: <a href="http://flippinawesome.org/topic-undefined/topic-undefined-episode-1/">Topic Undefined</a>
<!--more-->
The idea behind the podcast is simple. Both Brian and I like to share cool links, but we often don't get a chance to do more than that. In other words, talk about <i>why</i> something is cool. Each episode of the podcast will focus on links we've shared recently and why we think it is important.

As I said, I've got no idea how well this is going to work, but we hope it provides some context to the important news, tips, and discussions in the client-side community.
