A few weeks ago I read, and reviewed, a book for Packt. As my reward I was given the choice of any book I'd like. At the time, there wasn't anything that interested me. So I asked if I could give away a copy of Matt Gifford's <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/object-oriented-programming-coldfusion/book">OO Programming in ColdFusion</a> book and was told that would be fine. 

So... to keep this nice and simple, here is how the giveaway will work. Post a comment (ensure you use your real email address, only I will see it) that answers this question: "The only thing that would make a movie with robots and giant monsters better would be ...." Don't stress too much over this as I'll be picking a winner by random selection, but you must answer the question. I'll pick a winner Wednesday. Enjoy.
