Yesterday I discovered (via Twitter) a new site, <a href="http://meettheipsums.com/">Meet the Ipsums</a>. All it does is collect, list, and sample the various Lorem Ipsum generators out there. My new favorite is <a href="http://www.catipsum.com/">Cat Ipsum</a>.

After mentioning this on Twitter, my buddy <a href="http://bayousoft.com/">Ryan LeTulle</a> mentioned that he had wanted to build a "Cajun Ipsum." I decided to see how quickly I could whip one up in Node.js. Turns out - not long at all. Ryan helped out with the design (which is based on the <a href="http://purecss.io/">Pure</a> framework) and with the data (as my local friends will tell you, I'm a Yankee and will probably always will be, no matter how much I love it down here ;). 

So I present to you another useless Internet-toy, <a href="http://www.cajunipsum.com">CajunIpsum.com</a>. 

If you're curious, the code behind the site (just a few files) is up on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/cfjedimaster/Cajun-Ipsum">https://github.com/cfjedimaster/Cajun-Ipsum</a>.
