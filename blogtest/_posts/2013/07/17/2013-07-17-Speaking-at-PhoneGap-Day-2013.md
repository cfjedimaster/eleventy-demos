As a last minute change, I'll be speaking at <a href="http://pgday.phonegap.com/us2013/">PhoneGap Day</a> in Portland this Friday. I'll be doing a quick (20 minute!) presentation on Parse.com and PhoneGap. You can still <a href="http://pgday13.eventbrite.com/">register</a> if you hurry up!

Speaking of Parse and PhoneGap, I'll be doing a longer form version of this at the CocoaHeads user group in Ottawa on August 8th: <a href="http://cocoaheads.org/ca/OttawaGatineauOntario/">CocoaHeads:   Ottawa/Gatineau, Ontario, Canada</a>. My second trip to Canada this year!
