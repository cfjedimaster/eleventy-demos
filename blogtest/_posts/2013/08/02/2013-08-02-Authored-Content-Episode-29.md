Just a quick note that I was honored to speak on the <a href="http://iviewsource.com/category/authoredcontent/">Authored Content</a> pod cast. It just wrapped up live and you can watch the recording here. I talk about Creative Cloud, PhoneGap, and a few other topics. It was also pretty cool to meet the other guys (I had only met one of them before) and talk tech.
