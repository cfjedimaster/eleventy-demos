I'm a huge fan of the <a href="https://github.com/jrowny/brackets-snippets">Snippets</a> extension for Brackets. As my memory seems to get worse with old age, I find that having a quick way to include code bits into my document a huge time saver. As an example, I've never been able to remember the right syntax for the link tag for CSS. Ditto for the stupid argument you have to add to form tags for file uploads. I've got some weird mental block for some reason and just rely on my snippets to help me remember.

In that vein, today I whipped up a set of data files for <a href="http://topcoat.io">Topcoat</a>, an open source UI framework for desktop and mobile sites. These data files can be added to your Snippets data directory (this will be under your Brackets Extensions folder and inside of the folder created for the Snippets extension) to provide quick access to the various UI controls Topcoat supports.

Here's a screenshot. Note - I don't usually keep the Snippets panel quite this large.

Hopefully that's readable. I don't typically use the keyboard shortcuts so I didn't really spend a lot of time thinking about them. You can find the bits up on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/topcoat/topcoat-brackets-extension">https://github.com/topcoat/topcoat-brackets-extension</a>. Any suggestions, or pull requests, are definitely welcome.

Just to be clear - this code is <strong>not</strong> an extension itself. That may come in the future.
