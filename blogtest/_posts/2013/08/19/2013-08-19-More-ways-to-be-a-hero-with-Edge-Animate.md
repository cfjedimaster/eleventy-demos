I've been enjoying playing with Edge Animate. Not that I can make anything pretty with it, but if you need an animation of a square that moves to the left, <strong>I AM YOUR GUY!</strong> I like hacking additional functionality into Edge Animate projects and those blog entries end up being pretty popular. (In fact, I've got yet another follow up to my 'show when visible' series.) 

This weekend I got an email from Rob Boerman. He has a site called <a href="http://www.edgehero.com/">Edge Hero</a> that you might want to check out. He has a library of useful interactions/widgets you can add to your project.
