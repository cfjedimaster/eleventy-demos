One of my favorite tools has just been updated - <a href="http://www.fusion-reactor.com/">FusionReactor 5</a>.  If you haven't heard of it, FusionReactor is an <strong>incredibly</strong> deep server monitor for ColdFusion servers. There's some incredibly cool new stuff in the release including a new responsive UI, support for Hibernate and MongoDB, improved alerts, simpler JDBC testing, and extended support for other J2EE platforms.

You can play with a live <a href="http://demo.fusion-reactor.com/">demo</a> to see for yourself or just <a href="http://www.fusion-reactor.com/download">download</a> it now. 

Even better - there is now a mobile app for FusionReactor!

And if you still haven't checked out the companion product, <a href="http://www.fusion-analytics.com/fa/">FusionAnalytics</a>, make the time to do so now.
