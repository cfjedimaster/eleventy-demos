Earlier today I wrote a quick blog entry and while in my admin, I noticed this...

So - I suppose I should have something more important to say, but, nah, I don't. I had my <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2013/2/12/Ten-Years-Ago-Today">ten year</a> anniversary back in February but didn't realize I was approaching another milestone. Apparently I'm nearing 500 or blog entries per year, which seems stupid insane, but I'd hope that at least 50 of those over the past 10+ years have been useful, helpful, or at least funny. (And maybe sometimes all of the above.) 

See you at 10000.
