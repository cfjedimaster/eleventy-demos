Today's public service announcement is for <a href="http://cflive.net/">CF Live</a>, a completely online tool for testing ColdFusion code. It supports running your code with both the ColdFusion and Railo engines (with a few exceptions to what is allowed). This is a great way to introduce folks to the language and let them play around with it a bit before installing.
