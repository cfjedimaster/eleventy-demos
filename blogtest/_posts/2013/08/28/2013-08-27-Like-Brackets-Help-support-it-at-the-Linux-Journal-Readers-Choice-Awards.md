My favorite editor, <a href="http://brackets.io">Brackets</a>, is up for an award at the <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/linux-journal-readers-choice-awards-2013">Linux Journal Readers' Choice Awards</a>. If you like Brackets too, please take a minute to vote for it. Voting ends September 23rd.
