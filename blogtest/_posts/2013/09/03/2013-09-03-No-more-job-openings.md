I don't typically blog about "editorial decisions", but I thought I'd put this out there in case I'm really wrong about it. I've decided to no longer post job openings on my blog. On one hand it was easy enough to just cut and paste and I like the idea of helping folks find jobs, but on the other hand... I just don't want to post them anymore here. There's other places to do so (and I'd be glad to hear people discuss where and how they search for jobs), but I think simple postings just don't make sense on this blog.

So yeah - that's my decision. Feel free to argue about it over lunch. :)
