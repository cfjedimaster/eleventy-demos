Ok, I don't normally blog about Photoshop, but this was just too darn cool not to share. Photoshop CC users today will get an update that adds a new feature called Generator. Generator lets you create image assets in <i>real time</i> as you work on a PSD. By simply naming a layer with a specific format (more on that in a moment), Photoshop will automatically create files for you.

To see a quick demo of this new feature, watch the very professional video below:
</p>

<p>
And here is another good example from Lynda.com:
</p>

<p>
So as I mentioned, there is a naming scheme you apply to your layers in order for this to work right. You can find good documentation for this here: <a href="http://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/generate-assets-layers.html">Generate image assets from layers | Photoshop CC</a>. 
</p>

<p>
The best example I've seen of this so far is from a coworker, Paul Burnett. He created a PSD template that matches PhoneGap icons:
</p>

</p>

<p>
Using this new feature of Photoshop, you can then simply edit the Smart Object, save, and you immediately get all of the icons for every platform PhoneGap supports. I made my own video of it that demonstrates this in action:
</p>

<iframe width="600" height="450" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/SRPm4ieyisM?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>
You can download the PSD from Paul's GitHub page here: <a href="https://github.com/PaulBurnett/PhoneGap-Build-Icon-Template">https://github.com/PaulBurnett/PhoneGap-Build-Icon-Template</a>.
</p>

<p>
Speaking of GitHub, you can actually see the source behind this feature on the Adobe Photoshop GitHub account: <a href="https://github.com/adobe-photoshop">https://github.com/adobe-photoshop</a>
</p>

<p>
But wait - there's more! If you launch Edge Reflow, you should have another update waiting for you. Part of the new Photoshop update is a connection between Photoshop and Edge Reflow. Again, better people with better video skills can explain it better than I can:
</p>

<p>
A quick note as this may be confusing. In the video above you will notice a "Edge Reflow Project" menu item in Photoshop's Generate menu:
</p>

</p>

<p>
I did <strong>not</strong> have this immediately. I only saw this after I updated Edge Reflow and restarted Photoshop.
