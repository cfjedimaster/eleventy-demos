Ok, that sounds a bit like a demand, so consider this a request. If you haven't bought your tickets for <a href="http://ncdevcon.com/">NCDevCon</a>, please check it out soon. The conference is in beautiful North Carolina this September on the 21st and 22nd. The price is great and the <a href="http://ncdevcon.com/page.cfm/sessions-2013">content</a> is amazing. I'll be talking about Brackets and giving a new presentation Practical HTML. Time is running out so please book your tickets now!
