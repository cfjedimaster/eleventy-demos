Sunday seems to be my day for blog updates (see <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2013/9/7/A-quick-test-of-Prismjs">last week</a>). Today I pushed another minor update for comments. If you wrap text with an asterisk, it will be bolded. If you use an underscore, it will be italicized. Nothing too exciting but I like it so to me it is an awesome addition. ;) 
</p>

<p>
So that's a good thing. On the other side, I'm considering getting more strict about people posting code. Even with the warning to use Gists or Pastebin, I still have a few people every week who insist on posting large code blocks. I've considered adding a simple client-side check that counts the number of &lt; elements.

Finally - I'm also considering another change to handle posts with a large set of comments. I'm thinking of doing something where once a post passes 50 comments, I load the first 50 via Ajax.
