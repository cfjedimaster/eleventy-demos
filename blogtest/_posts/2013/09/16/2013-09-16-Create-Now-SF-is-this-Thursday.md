OK, so I don't know how many of my readers live in the Bay Area (or within driving distance!), but don't forget that <strong>this Thursday</strong> is the kick off the <a href="http://www.adobeeventsonline.com/createevent/?sdid=KAYFC">Create Now</a> tour in San Francisco. This is a <strong>free</strong> event being held in San Francisco's American Conservatory Theater.

I understand that a majority of my readership is probably more on the developer side than the design side, but this event will be covering many things that I think will be of interest. If you saw my <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2013/9/9/Photoshop-launches-new-Generator-feature">recent post</a> on Node.js integration with Photoshop, I think you have a good idea about how cool it is when designers and developers work together. Edge tools will also be getting some love at these events as well.

Again - this is 100% free and you also have a chance to come away with a year's subscription to the Creative Cloud.
