<p>
I don't typically post simple links anymore but as this has a rather tight schedule and may not make it before my next <a href="http://flippinawesome.org/topic-undefined/">podcast</a>, I wanted to share it right away. I had the pleasure of seeing <a href="http://rachelnabors.com/">Rachel Nabors</a> speak on CSS Animations a few months back. While animation is not really something I'm good at, I was blown away by how far CSS had come in terms of interactivity. 
</p>

<p>
Rachel is hosting a one day workshop on October 4th. This will be available both to people local to the event as well as online. It is a full day and covers CSS (obviously), HTML5 Audio, performance, and more.
