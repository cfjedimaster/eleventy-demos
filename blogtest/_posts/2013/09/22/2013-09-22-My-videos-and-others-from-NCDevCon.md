<a href="http://www.ncdevcon.com">NCDevCon</a> is over and once again it was an incredible conference. What makes NCDevCon <i>especially</i> good is that all of the presentations are recorded and available to anyone to see. Here are my videos as well as some others I thought were good.

First up is my presentation on Brackets: <a href="http://textiles.online.ncsu.edu/online/Play/472adfe9eef84847bc52f6598ef42c871d?catalog=109c4c50-f182-410f-a13a-b31be9cf5323">Using Brackets to Awesome-ify your Web Development</a>
</p>

<p>
Next is my presentation on HTML5. I <i>really</i> like this presentation. <a href="http://textiles.online.ncsu.edu/online/Play/dddc51db649f4f968a00e2bd10a1e45b1d?catalog=109c4c50-f182-410f-a13a-b31be9cf5323">Practical HTML5</a>
</p>

<p>
Finally, here is a <i>very</i> long presentation I did on PhoneGap. This was a last minute addition to cover for a speaker who had a family emergency. It isn't the most polished presentation I've done but it might still be of interest to folks. <a href="http://textiles.online.ncsu.edu/online/Play/178ae89729a541e2a85420d8f8f43b481d?catalog=109c4c50-f182-410f-a13a-b31be9cf5323">PhoneGap and Stuff</a>
</p>

<p>
Now I'd like to share a few presentations I thought were particularly good. First is David Epler talking about <a href="http://textiles.online.ncsu.edu/online/Play/a7d892b5465845358de333526495f44e1d?catalog=109c4c50-f182-410f-a13a-b31be9cf5323">web penetration and hacking tools</a>. This is a <strong>scary</strong> presentation. Seriously. Next is John K. Paul with <a href="http://textiles.online.ncsu.edu/online/Play/7e1b879d11d84f99b9078030df0f69061d?catalog=109c4c50-f182-410f-a13a-b31be9cf5323">JavaScript - The Real Bad Parts</a>.
</p>

<p>
Another incredibly good presentation, but one that is not online yet (check later, it was an Unconference and it <i>was</i> recorded, but it isn't available at time of publication), was Doug Shepers of the W3C talking about accessible data visualization. I cannot recommend it enough and it was one of the most interesting presentations I've seen in a long time.

<p>
I can say without a doubt I was incredibly happy with NCDevCon, both as a speaker and an attendee. If you can attend next year I definitely recommend you make it a priority!
