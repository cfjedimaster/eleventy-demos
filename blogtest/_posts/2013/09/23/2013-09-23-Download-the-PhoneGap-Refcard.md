Very happy to announce that the latest DZone Refcard was written by yours truly. You can now download the official DZone PhoneGap Refcard here: <a href="http://refcardz.dzone.com/refcardz/getting-started-phonegap">http://refcardz.dzone.com/refcardz/getting-started-phonegap</a>
</p>

DZone does require you to sign in, but it is entirely free, and there are a heck of a lot of other cool reference sheets there as well.
