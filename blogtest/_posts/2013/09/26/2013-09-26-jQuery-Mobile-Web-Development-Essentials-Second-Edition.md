<p>
I'm very happy to announce that the <a href="http://www.jquerymobile.com">jQuery Mobile</a> book that I wrote with <a href="http://andymatthews.net/">Andy Matthews</a> has now been updated to the second edition. It covers jQuery Mobile 1.3.2 (we couldn't wait for 1.4 unfortunately) and includes new UI features like panels and responsive tables.
</p>

<p>
You can order the book from Packt right now here: <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/jquery-mobile-web-development-essentials-2e/book">Packt</a>
</p>

<p>
Another option is via the Amazon link below. I get a small kickback when you do and a kitten smiles. Amazon is showing the book as being unavailable till the end of October, but it really should just be a few more days.
</p>

<p>
I am proud of this book as I think it really helps explain jQuery Mobile in a simple, easy to approach manner. I hope you like it too.
