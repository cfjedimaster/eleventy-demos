Many months ago I participated in a tour where we showcased some of our initiatives to help make the web a better place. This involved our efforts with web standards as well as our <a href="http://html.adobe.com/edge/">Edge</a> suite of tools. 
</p>

<p>
These tools have come a <i>long</i> way since their initial release and I thought it would be great to give people an update on some of these tools and demonstrate how far they've come. If you've never tried them, then this will be an excellent way to check them out. If you have tried them before, then this is a chance to see where they are now.

<p>
On Friday October 11th at 12PM CST, I'll be hosting a Google Hangout focused on Edge Animate, Edge Reflow, Edge Code/Brackets, and Edge Inspect. I'll be joined by fellow evangelists <a href="http://paultrani.com/">Paul Trani</a> and <a href="http://sjespers.com/">Serge Jespers</a>.
</p>

<p>
To be clear, this is absolutely free and online only. All you need is a browser and some free time. The session will last for two hours with thirty minutes dedicated to each tool. If you have any questions, just comment below, and as I normally do with these online sessions, I'd love to get a basic idea of who is going to show up, so if you think you can, leave me a RSVP below!
