While it may not be as useful as my <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2013/9/27/I-know-what-Brackets-is-missing">last extension</a>, I whipped up a quick extension this week called HTMLEscaper. All it does is escape HTML. I know - not very exciting, right?

After switching to <a href="http://prismjs.com/">PrismJS</a> I realized that I needed to escape any HTML characters in my code samples. I've been using this tool (<a href="http://www.htmlescape.net/htmlescape_tool.html">HTMLEscape.net</a>) but I really wanted something in Brackets. Here is a quick screen shot of it in action:

You can install it now via the Brackets Extension manager or grab the code on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/cfjedimaster/brackets-htmlescaper">https://github.com/cfjedimaster/brackets-htmlescaper</a>.
