<p>
Just a quick note that my article on the new linting API in Brackets was just published: <a href="http://blog.brackets.io/2013/10/07/new-linting-api/">New Linting API</a>.
</p>

<p>
The article discusses how the extension API for Brackets Sprint 31 was updated to provide better support for linting operations.
