<p>
Just a reminder about the meeting tomorrow with myself, Serge, and Paul. It will start promptly at 12PM Central (1PM EST, 10AM PST) and run for about 2 hours (give or take a few minutes). We will <strong>not</strong> be using Google Hangouts as the experience for audience members is not optimal. This means we lose the 'record to Youtube' functionality, but I want the best experience for folks who can show up. We will use Connect instead which requires Flash on your browser, or the mobile app. The URL for the meeting is:
