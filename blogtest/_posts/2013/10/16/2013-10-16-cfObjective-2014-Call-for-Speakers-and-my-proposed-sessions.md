<p>
While it isn't terribly obvious on the <a href="http://cfobjective.com/">web site</a>, cfObjective 2014 has opened their call for speakers. If you want to speak at what is easily one of the best web conferences out there, you have from now till November 1st to get your submissions in. Here are the details: <a href="http://cfobjective.com/news/2014-call-for-speakers/">Call for Speakers</a>
</p>

Here are the sessions I've proposed:<br/>
