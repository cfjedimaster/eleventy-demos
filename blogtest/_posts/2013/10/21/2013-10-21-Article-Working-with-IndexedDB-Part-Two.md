<p>
Just a quick note to announce the second part of my IndexedDB series has been released at NetTuts: <a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/working-with-indexeddb-part-2/">Working with IndexedDB - Part 2</a>. You can (and should) read the first part <a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/working-with-indexeddb/">here</a>. I had hoped to finish the series with just two parts, but I really felt like it made sense to break it up into three. IndexedDB is a fairly complex topic and I'm trying my best to make it simpler to understand. Definitely let me know what you think!
