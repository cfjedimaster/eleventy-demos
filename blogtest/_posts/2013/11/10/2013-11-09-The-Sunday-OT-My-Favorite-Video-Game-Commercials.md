As I'm up too early this Sunday, I thought it was an appropriate time for another Sunday OT post. Earlier this week I was thinking about my favorite video game commercials so I thought I'd share a few. As always, feel free to disagree and suggest your own. (But I'm right - don't forget.) So far I'm pretty unimpressed with what I've seen for the XBox One and I don't even remember if I've seen a PS4 commercial.

Let's start with one of my favorite - the Gears of War "Mad World" commercial. This was so unexpected for me and I can remember thinking at the time that I couldn't believe Microsoft would approve it. Gears of War is a great series, although I didn't get around to playing Judgement. If you really like the song, you can hear the entire thing <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3N1MlvVc4">here</a>.

Next up is one that is so bat shit insane I can't believe it got approved as well. Sony had quite a few off the wall commercials, but this one pushes the limit. I suppose it succeeded in that I still remember it nearly twenty years later, but I can't see a parent watching this and thinking, "Yeah, I'll go buy my kid a PS2!"

Next up is the slightly NSWF (audio) commercial for Battlefield 3. This was the second Battlefield game I picked up and the one that got me hooked to the series. Unfortunately 4 fell flat for me a bit (I'm going to review it once I finish COD), but I absolutely love the imagery of this commercial.

As for funny commercials, the "Kevin Butler" series for Sony was incredible. I wanted to pick just one but I found this 8 minute montage of all his commercials and just sat through the entire thing. I can't do that for TED videos so that just tells you how great this campaign was. (Actually, this is not <i>every</i> commercial as I just remembered a few not in this collection.) Jerry Lambert (the actor behind Kevin Butler) is now in a Wendy's commercial which is just plain sad.

And finally - my number one - most favorite video game commercial of all time - Dead Island. The game was nowhere near as emotional as this commercial (see my <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2011/10/23/Review-Dead-Island">review</a>) but that doesn't make me like this commercial any less. The music, the shots, the emotional aspect of using a child, and the way it plays with time just makes this commercial brilliant.
