Every year I remind folks that November is National Adoption Month. My wife and I adopted all of our children from South Korea. It was a wonderful experience. If you've ever considered adoption as an option for growing your family, now is a perfect time to reach out and find out more. You can hit <a href="http://www.adoption.com">Adoption.com</a> as a starting point or feel free to ask me anything.

I watched this video today and thought it was particularly touching. It gives you a good look at how kids view adoption.
