If you are a Creative Cloud subscriber, be sure to make note of the update to Flash Professional today. Despite being listed as a "Bug Fixes" update, this is actually a quite significant update as it now includes the ability to natively create HTML5 Canvas animations. This is done via the <a href="http://www.createjs.com/#!/CreateJS">CreateJS</a> library.

After updating Flash Pro, you will see the option right away in the opening dialog:

As a test, I wrote a quick and simple animation and then published it. The result - as expected - wasn't a SWF but HTML and JavaScript. You can see an example of the output here: <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/demos/2013/dec/3/Untitled-3.html">http://www.raymondcamden.com/demos/2013/dec/3/Untitled-3.html</a>. And of course, being HTML5 based, it works just fine in iOS:
