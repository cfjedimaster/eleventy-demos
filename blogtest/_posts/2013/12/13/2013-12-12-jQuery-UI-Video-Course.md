<p>
Just a quick note to let y'all know about a new video course available for <a href="http://www.jqueryui.com">jQuery UI</a>. Ben Fhala released a set of videos for Packt covering jQuery UI. I had the pleasure of doing a tech review on the videos a few months back and I thought they were pretty well done. I haven't really talked much about jQuery UI lately but I've got a lot of respect for it. You can find more details about the video product <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/jquery-user-interface-development/video">here</a> and watch a sample below.
