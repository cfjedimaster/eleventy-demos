I'm <i>very</i> proud to announce that my first article for <a href="http://flippinawesome.org/">flippin' awesome</a> has just gone live. If you haven't been reading <strong>flippin' awesome</strong> then you are really missing out. It was created by my archenemy, Brian Rinaldi, who has really gone above and beyond to get some of the best content out there. Seriously - my article barely makes the cut there and I think it is a pretty good article.

Speaking of - my article is <a href="http://flippinawesome.org/2013/12/16/moving-to-static-and-keeping-your-toys/">Moving to Static and Keeping Your Toys</a>. It takes a look at the various services out there that can compliment and extend a static site. Think Disqus, but covering other things like forms and calendars. I'm not sure why but I'm really into static sites lately so this article is one I'm rather proud of. I hope you enjoy it.

It also has the best header to one of my pieces yet...
