I've run this blog for a little over ten years now, and from time to time I ask my readers to give me feedback about the site. I don't necessarily always <i>follow</i> that feedback, I write about what excites me, but I do want to get an idea of how I'm doing, what could be done better, and what really works well for my readers. 
</p>

I've created a little Google Doc form that you can fill out in about five minutes. Feel free to tear me apart if you wish - I can take it (ok, I can't, but I'll pretend). At the end of the day I'd rather have honest feedback than just a simple pat on the back. (Although that's kinda nice too. ;)
