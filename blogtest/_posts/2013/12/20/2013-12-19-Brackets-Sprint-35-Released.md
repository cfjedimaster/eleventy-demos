<p>
Just a short note to let folks know that <a href="http://brackets.io">Brackets</a> has released yet another update - Sprint 35. This was a shorter sprint due to the holidays so the list of updated features isn't long, but there are some pretty important changes in my opinion.
</p>
<!--more-->
<ul>
<li><b>New Find/Replace UI:</b> Replace now uses a streamlined, much cleaner UI supporting the same features as Find, including incremental search and highlighting. New case-sensitive and regular expression toggle buttons for easy access in Find, Find in Files, and Replace.</li>
<li><b>Launching Live Preview on Mac:</b> On Mac, Chrome does not need to be relaunched when starting Live Preview.</li>
<li><b>Faster Start-up:</b> Brackets now loads up to 50% faster thanks to minified JavaScript and pre-compiled LESS.
</ul>

<p>
That last one I think is pretty nice. I tend to reload Brackets quite a bit during extension development so anything that speeds that up is a good thing.

If you already have Brackets installed just check for a new update from the Help menu or head over to the <a href="http://download.brackets.io">downloads page</a>.
