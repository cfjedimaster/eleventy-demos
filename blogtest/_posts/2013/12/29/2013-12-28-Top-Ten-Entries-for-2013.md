<p>
These types of blog entries (best of year X) are admittedly kind of lame, but I was curious myself to see what my top entries were over the past year. So without further ado, here are my top entries for the past year. (Yes, I know it isn't over yet, but as I'm vacation I doubt I'll write anything more of real interest between now and New Year's Eve):

I knew my PhoneGap posts were popular, but I'm pretty shocked to see them dominate the top ten list.
