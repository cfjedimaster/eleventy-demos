<p>
Thank you to everyone who took the time to respond to my <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2013/12/18/Help-me-help-you">site survey</a> from last month. I had almost a hundred responses and I thought I'd share the results with my readers.
</p>

<p>
Let's start with the first question which asked if you were a regular visitor versus just someone who shows up when Google leads you here.
</p>

</p>

<p>
I honestly think these numbers are a bit skewed in favor of folks who are regulars. I know I've got a good set of people who follow via RSS and email, but I really think the majority is higher on the "from Google" side.
</p>

<p>
Next I asked what folks wanted to see more and less of.

</p>

<p>
The clear winner on the "more of" side was ColdFusion. I recognize that I'm doing a lot less original content involving ColdFusion, and I'm going to try to correct that this year. I've got an idea for a multi-part series I'm going to try to start after my next trip. JavaScript and HTML5 come in next and I doubt I'll have trouble with them. 
</p>

<p>
On the flip side, the second and third place items for "less of" were Node and jQuery Mobile. Honestly I'm going to ignore these. I'm <i>very</i> excited about Node and want to become an expert in it. jQuery Mobile still interests me (although I no longer present on it regularly) and it drives a lot of traffic. (To be clear, I don't want to be a slave to analytics, but seriously, my jQM posts tend to get hammered.) Oh, and the video games posts will continue. (But I'll definitely keep them to Sundays.) 
</p>

<p>
Next up was my question about your primary role:

</p>

<p>
This is mostly what I expected - and I'd be willing to bet that a lot of those developers are doing at least some things that may have been considered designer tasks in the past. I think we're going to see <i>many</i> more people acting in a hybrid role in the future.
</p>

<p>
Finally, what about the "biggest problem" question? I'll paste in the responses here.
</p>

<blockquote>
Keeping up with the constant changes and increased complexity. lack of time to really get to know the full potential of a particular technology pooping myself ? Dwindling ColdFusion support / users Time to expand my knowledge CF haven't a seriuous IDE! The constantly shifting landscape of new technologies Grumps Browser/Mobile app specific coding Time Finding a job - at the moment cordova instability and android 2.x help desk Getting time to do the job properly Moving to fast CFML's Future. The number of .NET jobs and the lack of ColdFusion jobs. The expectation that every coder must code a certain way, or else you aren't considered professional. For criminey's sake - sometimes a simple CRUD database with a few process pages is just that. No need for objects, frameworks or whatever is en vogue. Selling ColdFusion over PHP/Ruby/.NET/etc There too many lib A looooot to learn, not even thinkg about mastering... Fads and lack of emphasis on best practices So much to learn, so little time lack of end-user focus / nerds for nerds Explaining what I do for a living.... Patch Tuesday... If related to blogging. Duplicate content and holier than thou types Experience Finding CF material between 5tagger and advanced Coldfusion evangelists... focussing too much on other technologies. If you don't chant the mantra, who will?? selecting the tech/tools/frameworks to focus on Training Elitism and sense of privilege determining what information and trends are really worth learning; I also work in a company where teamwork and communication is extremely minimal, but I don't think there's anything you can do about that. Keeping up with new code changesl. Keeping up to many to write, but none to huge. I want to do more AJAX, but not use JavaScript getting started / in / making a carrer out of this and leaving my old job / yes I'm special

I think the biggest theme here is "keeping up". That's something I hear quite a bit. There's also some concern about ColdFusion's future. Frankly, I've been hearing that for nearly 10 years now so I don't worry about it too much. Of course, I've also ensured ColdFusion isn't my skill. If you have one skill (no matter what language), you should be pretty darn worried. This one in particular stood out to me:

I think this may be a reaction to the amount of blogging material or presentations out there that deal with frameworks and design patterns. Keep in mind - those simple sites exist. There is nothing wrong with them! But you won't see people talking about it because, well, they're simple. No one is going to sit in an hour long session about this because no one really needs help in this. 
</p>

<p>
The point (well, imo) of learning these advanced topics is <b>not</b> so you can blindly use them in <b>every single web page</b> but rather to be knowledgeable about the problems they help solve. That way when you have that problem, you know a way to attack it. My 2 cents.

Thank you again to everyone who took the time to respond, and I hope you find this year as good as (or hopefully even better than) than last year.
