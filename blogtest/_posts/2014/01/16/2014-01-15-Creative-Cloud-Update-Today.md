Just a quick note to let my readers know that another update to Creative Cloud has landed today. Other people have written it up better so I'm just going to share a few links. The updates are to Photoshop CC, Illustrator CC, InDesign CC, and Muse CC. (I saw a presentation on Muse a few weeks back and was really impressed. Obviously it isn't something I'd use, but for non-technical people it looks like a pretty darn cool solution, especially when you mix in the hosting options.)

Out of all the updates, the coolest though is <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/creative-cloud/learn/start/tutorials/photoshop-perspective-warp.html">perspective warp</a>. I am convinced that Photoshop is built with pure magic. This is - again - one more example of that. My buddy Andrew Trice created a cool video showing it off. (I've linked to his post below.)

Just to be clear, when you add Optimus to anything you win. Period.
