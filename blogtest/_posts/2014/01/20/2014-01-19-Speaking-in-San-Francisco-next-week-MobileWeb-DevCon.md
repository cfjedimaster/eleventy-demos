<p>
Just a quick note that I'll be speaking next week at <a href="http://mobilewebdevconference.com/san-francisco-2014">Mobile+Web DevCon</a> in San Francisco. This is my third time at this conference and I like it. It is a small conference, but it has a great relaxed, casual feel to it that I don't get at most conferences. I'll be <a href="http://mobilewebdevconference.com/san-francisco-2014/agenda/day-two-agenda/1030am-c.html">speaking</a> on Wednesday so if you are in town, come check it out.
