<p>
One of my favorite tools has just hit 3.0 - <a href="http://html.adobe.com/edge/animate/">Edge Animate</a>. New features in this release include:
</p>
<!--more-->
<ul>
<li><b>Audio Support!</b> That's right - by using native HTML5 audio, your Edge Animate projects can bind audio events to the timeline, to elements, and even do audio transitions.</li>
<li><b>Responsive Scaling</b> This is exactly what it sounds like - proportional scaling of your Animate projects.</li> 
<li><b>Script Loading</b> Edge Animate now makes it easier to include other scripts in your project. You can either add in local libraries or point to CDNs.
</ul>

<p>
There is even more in 3.0. Check out the <a href="http://helpx.adobe.com/edge-animate/using/whats-new-edge-animate-30.html">release notes</a> for more. You can also see 3.0 in action below thanks to product manager and all around cool person Sarah Hunt:
