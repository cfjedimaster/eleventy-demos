<p>
NetTuts published my latest article this morning, a look at writing extensions for Brackets: <a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/creating-brackets-extensions/">Creating Brackets Extensions</a>. Read it and let me know what you think. I <i>love</i> writing extensions for Brackets so I hope this article encourages others.
