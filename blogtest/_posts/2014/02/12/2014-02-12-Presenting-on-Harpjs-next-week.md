<p>
Next week I'll be giving a presentation on <a href="http://harpjs.com">HarpJS</a> (and the <a href="http://www.harp.io">Harp platform</a>). For folks who just so happen to be in Louisiana, the first presentation will be Tuesday night at the Acadiana Adobe User Group (details here: <a href="http://www.acadiana-aug.org/index.cfm/2014/2/4/New-Meeting-Place">Meeting</a>). 
</p>

<p>
Of course, I assume most of my readership is <i>not</i> in the beautiful state of Louisiana, so for the rest of y'all, I'm going to make true on my promise to give Google Hangouts a try. I'll be hosting my first Hangout as a presentation so expect some bumps, but I think it will go ok. I've included a link to the details below. It will be held next Friday, February 21, at 12PM CST.
