<p>
In the past week I've gotten a few emails from folks working with the file system in PhoneGap/Cordova apps. Recently, the plugin had a major update and if you weren't paying attention to the docs/blogs, it would be easy to miss.

First, see the blog post from the Cordova site: <a href="http://cordova.apache.org/news/2014/02/10/plugins-release.html">Plugins Release: Feb 10, 2014</a>. Second - you can get even deeper docs at the plugin Github repo docs: <a href="https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-file/blob/dev/doc/index.md">Docs</a>. Finally, as the changes here were intended to bring the plugin closer to the core HTML5 FileSystem API, you should refresh your memory with the excellent <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/file/filesystem/">HTML5Rocks</a> article and the <a href="http://dev.w3.org/2009/dap/file-system/pub/FileSystem/">official spec</a> as well.

I started up a fresh project for iOS and had no problem accessing the file system, but I didn't do anything too complex. If folks want to talk specifics, I can try to create a specific demo, but again, I <strong>strongly</strong> recommend reading the plugin doc.
