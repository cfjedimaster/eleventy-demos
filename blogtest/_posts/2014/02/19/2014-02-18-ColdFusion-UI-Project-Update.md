About a month ago <a href="http://cfmlblog.adamcameron.me/">Adam Cameron</a> and I <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2014/1/23/Im-not-going-to-tell-you-to-stop-using-ColdFusion-UI-tags-anymore">announced</a> the ColdFusion UI project - a set of articles/demos that demonstrate how to do UI <i>without</i> the ColdFusion UI tags (like cfform, cftable, etc). I wanted to give folks a quick update on the project.
</p>

<p>
Since release we've had 36 pull requests from multiple people in the community. 
</p>

<p>
We now have chapters for:
</p>

<ul>
<li>cfajaxproxy
<li>cfcalendar
<li>cfchart
<li>cfdiv
<li>cflayout/tabs
<li>cfmenu
<li>cfslider
<li>cftable
<li>cftooltip
<li>cfwindow 
</ul>

<p>
So far - a great start. I truly hope this turns into a resource that devs can share with their teammates to help them improve their front end skills.
