So a long, <i>long</i> time ago the site InsideRIA was shut down and the articles archived over at DevelopRIA. I blogged about this <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2011/1/28/My-InsideRIA-Archive">here</a> back in 2011. (The old days. Remember them?) As just an FYI, that site is now dead too. I was able to procure an export of all the data, so if you are an author of something from the site and want a copy of your text, download the attachment below.<p><a href='enclosures/C{% raw %}%3A%{% endraw %}5Chosts{% raw %}%5C2013%{% endraw %}2Eraymondcamden{% raw %}%2Ecom%{% endraw %}5Cenclosures{% raw %}%2Fdevelopria%{% endraw %}5Ftext{% raw %}%5Fbackup%{% endraw %}2Ezip'>Download attached file.</a></p>
