<p>Just a quick note to suggest that folks attending this years <a href="http://www.cfobjective.com">cfObjective</a> consider coming up a day early for <a href="http://www.intothebox.org/">Into the Box</a>. This is a conference for all things Ortus - ok, maybe you don't recognize that name - but these are the folks behind the ColdBox family of products, which last time I checked had a solution for <i>everything</i>.

<p>
There are two full tracks and a <i>lot</i> of content so definitely check it out! The price is 199 but you get additional things with your purchase as well (heck, the HackMyCF subscription alone makes it more than worth the price!).
