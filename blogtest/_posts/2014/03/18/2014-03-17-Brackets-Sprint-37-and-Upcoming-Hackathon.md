Today Brackets Sprint 37 was released. You can download it via the <a href="http://download.brackets.io">usual place</a>. Release notes may be found here: <a href="https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/Release-Notes:-Sprint-37">https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/Release-Notes:-Sprint-37</a>. My favorite updates here are the ability to <strong>finally</strong> disable automatic tabbing and closing tag insertion. I'm probably the minority here but those features don't help - they get in the way of my natural typing. You can see more details about that update <a href="https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/How-to-Use-Brackets#preferences">here</a>.

Finally, if you are in the San Francisco area next Wednesday, consider coming to a public Hackathon: <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Brackets-Editor/events/169625592/">San Francisco Brackets Meetup and Hackathon</a>. This is a great way to meet the team and learn more about how the sausage is made.
