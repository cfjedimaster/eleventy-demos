So after <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2014/3/30/Check-out-Dash">raving</a> about Dash yesterday, I thought I'd whip up a quick Brackets integration extension for it. Brackets recently made Node integration a bit easier, and Dash has a simple CLI interface for searching, so it didn't take long to write an extension that lets you make a selection, hit a key combo, and then open the doc in Dash automatically.

As usual, you can grab it from the Extension Manager within Brackets itself, or clone the repo here: <a href="https://github.com/cfjedimaster/Brackets-Dash">https://github.com/cfjedimaster/Brackets-Dash</a>
