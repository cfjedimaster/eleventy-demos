Honestly, the title says it all. ;) Today we released the latest versions of ColdFusion and ColdFusion Builder. You can see more at the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion-family.html">product home page</a> including a video with some scary hairy guy in it. (Hint: Me.) I don't know if we have a specific doc about what changed from the public beta to release, but things did change.

One big example is the addition of <a href="https://wikidocs.adobe.com/wiki/display/coldfusionen/Application+variables">application specific DSNs</a>, something people have been asking for since dinosaurs ruled the world.

<p>
I also recommend reviewing the <a href="https://wikidocs.adobe.com/wiki/display/coldfusionen/ColdFusion+Language+Enhancements">language enhancements</a> doc as well, as it neatly summarizes the various language level updates in ColdFusion 11.

And as I've said a few times now - if you stopped using ColdFusion Builder in the past - you should <i>really</i> give it another look. I think I've said this before, but it has replaced Sublime as my ColdFusion editor. I still use Brackets as my primary editor, and I like using Sublime for quick ad hoc edits, but CFB is now one of my favorite tools.
