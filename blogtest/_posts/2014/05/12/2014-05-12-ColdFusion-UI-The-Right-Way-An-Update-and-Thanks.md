<p>
Just a quick note to remind folks of the <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2014/1/23/Im-not-going-to-tell-you-to-stop-using-ColdFusion-UI-tags-anymore">crusade</a> <a href="http://cfmlblog.adamcameron.me/">Adam Cameron</a> and I kicked off a few months ago - <a href="https://github.com/cfjedimaster/ColdFusion-UI-the-Right-Way">ColdFusion UI - The Right Way</a>.
</p>

<p>
The idea was to help ColdFusion developers work with client-side technologies while avoiding the built-in tools like cfgrid, cfwindow, and the epic cfpod. As I said back when I originally wrote about the project, we wanted to give folks an alternative as opposed to just saying, "Don't do it!". 
</p>

<p>
I want to publicly thank <a href="http://cfjquery.com/blog">Dave White</a>, who has contributed pull requests for cftextarea, cfgrid, cfpresentation, cfmediaplayer, cfmessagebox, cftree, cfselect, cftable, cfinput-autosuggest, cfslider, cfcalendar, and cfmenu. My god - I knew he helped a lot, but I honestly didn't know he did <strong>all</strong> that. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/cfjedimaster/ColdFusion-UI-the-Right-Way/pulls?direction=desc&page=1&sort=created&state=closed">history of pull requests</a> to see!
</p>

<p>
Of course, others have helped as well, and you can help too. You don't have to submit a pull request. You can help by just spreading the word. Have a coworker who is using cfwindow? "Gently" introduce him or her to the project. Have a friend using cfpod? Stop being their friend. (Ok, maybe that's a bit harsh.) Educating others can go a <i>long</i> way to improving everyone's code!
