One of the most fun parts of going to cfObjective is hanging out with my game-playing friends. While there I got to play three new games (and quite a few hands of Epic Spell Wars in which I <strong>never lost - honest!</strong>). Here they are (and yes, these are affiliate links so if you click to buy, I get a few pennies):

<strong>King of Tokyo</strong> involves giant monsters and Tokyo. Do I need to say more? I was a rabbit in a giant robot... of a rabbit. All in all probably the simplest of the games I played at cfObjective. As an FYI, this is by Richard Garfield, who created Magic the Gathering.

<strong>Fluxx</strong> is pretty interesting. As you play the game, the core rules can change with each hand, including how to win. There are many variations of the game (we played a Monty Python one). This was fun, if a bit confusing at times.

<strong>Shadow Hunters</strong> was the most unique of the new games I played. At a high level, the basic idea is that each player's character is one of three types, a Shadow (baddie), a Hunter (goodie), or Neutral (um, yeah, neutral). No one knows who is what and every character has slightly different rules on how they can win. I ended up as a werewolf who won the game with a final blow that took out all the rest of the players... with a machine gun. Yeah, it was cool. (Well, to me anyway. ;)
