<p>
I <i>believe</i> this is the first time this particular presentation has been available, but if I'm wrong, forgive me. My NCDevCon talk on Practical HTML5 is now available for watching online: <a href="http://ncdevcon.com/post.cfm/ncdevcon-2013-free-video-practical-html5">Practical HTML5</a>. Along with my talk, you can find many others available on their <a href="http://ncdevcon.com/page.cfm/blog">blog</a>. And by the way - NCDevCon has an open call for presentations. This is a great little conference that I've been privileged to attend a few times. I probably won't make it this year due to prior commitments, but I definitely recommend it.
