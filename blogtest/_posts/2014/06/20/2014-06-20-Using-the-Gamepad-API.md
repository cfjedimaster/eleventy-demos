<img src="https://static.raymondcamden.com/images/html5-gamepad-api.png" style="float:left;margin-right:10px;" /> My latest article for Tuts (this time <a href="http://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com">Game Tuts</a>) is now live. In this article I take a deep look at the gamepad API. I blogged about this a while ago but it has finally become (somewhat) more available to modern browsers. And yes, before someone says it, 'more available' doesn't mean 100%. Anyway, I hope you enjoy it: <a href="http://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/using-the-html5-gamepad-api-to-add-controller-support-to-browser-games--cms-21345">Using the HTML5 Gamepad API to Add Controller Support to Browser Games</a>
