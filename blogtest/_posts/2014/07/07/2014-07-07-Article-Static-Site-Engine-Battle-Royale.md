Nope - not one of my articles, but one by Brian Rinaldi. Brian's <a href="http://developer.telerik.com/featured/comparing-static-site-engines/">article</a> looks at three different static site engines and compares and contrasts them. It is a great article and as my readers know, I've been doing a lot with static site generators lately.
