I've been a fan of the Wolfenstein series for quite some time, and when I say "quite some time", I'm talking a <i>long time</i>. I remember playing the original Wolfenstein, back before it got fancy with 3D:

Because of my long history with the game, I was really looking forward to trying the latest incarnation, and especially interested in seeing how a FPS performed on the PS4. I was not disappointed.

Graphically and gameplay wise, the game is fun as hell. It has great balance, with only a few areas being out of sync difficulty wise with the others, and I found myself going to Google only for the very last boss battle. (And frankly, if I had just freaking looked up, it would have been pretty obvious what I needed to do.) The play is a <i>bit</i> similar to Gears of War in terms of making wise use of cover, and there is a stealth element present as well. But like <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/2014/7/6/Sunday-OT--Video-Game-Reviews">Dishonored</a>, it is somewhat optional. If you feel like being stealthy you can be, but if you want to run in guns blazing, that's an option as well. Even though I stuck to a few main guns, the variety available and the upgrades made the selection fun. I'm still not quite sure how they got a rocket launcher on an assault rifle, but I'm perfectly fine just accepting that.

The story is what really sold me though. I am a <strong>huge</strong> Alt-History fan, and while "The Nazis won" is kind of a trite example of the genre, in the game it works <i>very</i> well, especially mixed in with the sci-fi elements. As you play you come across various newspaper clippings and other items that give you a look at the history of the game and I made sure to read each and every one.

Probably the only negative I can think of is that there is no multiplayer, but honestly, I don't do much multiplayer nowadays anyway so it doesn't bother me much. It is good to see a game focused on single player for once! The game lasted about twenty hours for me, which is a good long time, and there is actually a valid reason to replay the entire game (more than just - "find all the hidden crap"). I won't say why as it is somewhat of a spoiler, but I've already started my second play through.

Sound good? Buy it via the link below and I get like a dollar or so that I'll put to my next video game.
