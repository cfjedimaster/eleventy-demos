It's kinda funny - but something as simple as the iOS status bar can be confusing as quantum mechanics. Holly wrote a blog post, <i>and</i> an interactive web-based simulator, that explains the various settings and configurations for the status bar. It is <strong>definitely</strong> recommended reading: <a href="http://devgirl.org/2014/07/31/phonegap-developers-guid/">PhoneGap Developer's Guide to the iOS Status Bar</a>.

P.S. Yes, this is a super short blog post, but I like to share important blog posts like this for the members of my audience lucky enough to avoid Twitter. Trust me - stay away...
