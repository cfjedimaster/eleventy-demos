A few months ago I <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/2014/4/22/Project-Parfait--PSD-Introspection-in-the-Browser">blogged</a> about the awesome new tool we released, Project Parfait. Project Parfait lets you upload and inspect PSDs directly in the browser. For developers like myself this was especially nice. As powerful as Photoshop is, I don't have a lot of experience with it. I found Project Parfait to be a much easier tool. As a web developer, being able to quickly see color palettes, font faces, and sizes was a huge benefit.

The good news is that as of this morning, Project Parfait has graduated from beta tool to a full release as part of the Creative Cloud. By logging into the Creative Cloud (<a href="http://creative.adobe.com">creative.adobe.com</a>), you get the <strong>same</strong> features you had with Parfait, even at the <strong>free tier</strong> of CC.
</p>

<p>
Note that you can also share these PSDs with people not on the Creative Cloud. In the next few months, this feature is going to pop up in other desktop tools as well.

As a quick tour, here is what you'll see different when selecting a PSD file in your Creative Cloud files tab.

Just hit the Extract link in the header and you'll see the same functionality you had with Parfait:
