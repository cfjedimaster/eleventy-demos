<p>
It isn't uncommon for Amazon to ship items from my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/registry/wishlist/2TCL1D08EZEYE">wish list</a> and leave off the name of the person who sent it to me (and if you ever sent me something and never got a thank you - that's why) - but this gift was sent to me and it wasn't even on my list. So... whoever you are... thank you! It has joined my collection. 
One day I'll share photos of my Star Wars collection. It hasn't quite hit Hoarders level yet, but I'm getting there.
