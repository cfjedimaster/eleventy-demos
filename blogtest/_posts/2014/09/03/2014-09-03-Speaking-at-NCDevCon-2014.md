<p>
I'm very happy to announce that I'll be speaking at <a href="http://ncdevcon.com/">NCDevCon 2014</a>. I've spoken at this conference for a few years now but didn't submit a topic this year due to some personal issues. Those personal issues are currently in hibernation for a few months and when an opening popped up at the last minute, I leapt at it. 
</p>

<p>
I'll be speaking on two topics this year. My first is a simple look at what I think are the top features of ColdFusion 11. This will be a very opinionated look at the features of ColdFusion 11 (and ColdFusion Builder 3) that I think are worth your attention.
</p>

<p>
The second topic will be a look at the <a href="http://ionicframework.com/">Ionic framework</a>. This is a presentation I was supposed to give a month or two ago but that event was cancelled. I'm a complete and utter Ionic fan boy so I can't wait to share the awesomeness of Ionic with others.
</p>

<p>
For folks who can't attend (shame on you - you should :) - all NCDevCon sessions are taped and will be available <strong>for free</strong> after the conference. But tickets are <strong>still</strong> for sale. It isn't too late. If you can make it, I <strong>highly</strong> recommend going!
</p>

<p>
p.s. Sorry for being quiet the last few days. I just got back from my brother's wedding and I'm somewhat swamped. I need a clone. Or three.
