How cool is <a href="http://www.ncdevcon.com">NCDevCon</a>? The presentation I finished 10 minutes ago is online. Now. There may be some audio issues in the middle (had some feedback) so you may want to switch to headphones (let me know), but overall, check it out and let me know. I've made no secret of my love for <a href="http://www.ionicframework.com">Ionic</a> and I hope this helps people get acquainted with it.

p.s. I didn't include my slide deck and example apps, but if folks would like them let me know and I'll post a copy.
