First, the good news. Today Adobe released the first update to ColdFusion 11: <a href="http://helpx.adobe.com/coldfusion/kb/coldfusion-11-update-1.html#id_25154">ColdFusion 11 - Update 1</a>. You can update via the normal admin interface. Please note that this update includes a connector update for IIS. If you are using IIS, first, I'm sorry, second, update the connector.

Finally, I'm sorry to say that I will not be speaking at the <a href="http://cfsummit.adobeevents.com/">ColdFusion Summit</a> this year. I was really looking forward to it, but I had something come up, something kinda important, that will have me quite a bit far away at the same time. I'll give details when I can. I <strong>strongly</strong> urge you to attend if you haven't gotten a ticket yet. If for some reason my ColdFusion Builder session is not picked up by someone else, you have my word that I'll give it via a Google Hangout sometime in November.
