I kinda stumbled upon this by accident, but <a href="http://www.ionicframework.com">Ionic</a> has a CDN you can find here:
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
<a href="http://code.ionicframework.com/">http://code.ionicframework.com/</a>
</p>

<p>
As you can imagine, it contains links for JavaScript and CSS resources and lets you grab earlier versions.

To be clear, this is <strong>not recommended</strong> for normal usage, and is especially not recommended for a PhoneGap/Cordova app. But if you are creating an online demo or using something like CodePen, this can be really helpful. I used it for my <a href="http://codepen.io/cfjedimaster/details/iplCx/">"tab button calls actionsheet demo"</a> for a StackOverflow answer from earlier in the week.
