<p>
I've already had multiple people ping me about this so I thought it was a good idea to make sure folks knew I was aware. I have not used the coldfusionjedi.com domain in a <i>long</i> time, but each year I was renewing. After some advice from a reader, I put it up for auction and sold it. So - yep - I know that requests for coldfusionjedi.com go someplace else. I also have some blog entries that may link to that domain. I'll correct them as I run across them.
