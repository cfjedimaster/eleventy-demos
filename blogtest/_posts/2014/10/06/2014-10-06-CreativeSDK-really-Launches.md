So a while ago I mentioned I was working on the <a href="http://creativesdk.adobe.com">CreativeSDK</a> project. My role is to help out with documentation, including tweaks to the API guides and writing articles. As someone still pretty new to ObjectiveC, my articles are pretty simple, but hopefully that's exactly the kind of content that can help people use it. The SDK is now public and you can peruse some of the terribly exciting articles I wrote that demonstrate things like <a href="https://creativesdk.adobe.com/docs/#/articles/files/index.html">CC file access</a> and <a href="https://creativesdk.adobe.com/docs/#/articles/psdextraction/index.html">PSD extraction</a>.
</p>

<p>
The best place to start though is the <a href="https://creativesdk.adobe.com/docs/#/articles/gettingstarted/index.html">Getting Started</a> article, which walks you through project set up (XCode is pretty darn impressive by the way) and how to handle basic authentication with Creative Cloud.
