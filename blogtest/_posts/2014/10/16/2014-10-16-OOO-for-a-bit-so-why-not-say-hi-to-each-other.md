As I despise email auto responders I'll use this as my official OOO (Out Of Office) notification for the next two weeks. I do not expect to be blogging at all. I probably won't be on Twitter. Emails will probably pile up as well. Everything will be back to normal(ish) around November 1st. In the meantime...

Every year or so I do a survey of my readers to find out what they are interested in, how well I'm meeting those needs, etc. I thought it might be kind of cool if my regular readers would like to introduce themselves to each other. For those who feel comfortable doing so - introduce yourself, say what you do, and have a nice little chat going as OT as you would like.
