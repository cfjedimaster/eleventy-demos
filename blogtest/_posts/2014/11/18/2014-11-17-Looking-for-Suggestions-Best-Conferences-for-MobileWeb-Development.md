Earlier today my buddy Andy Trice posted a question about conferences:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>What are the best conferences are for mobile and/or web development? native, hybrid, etc... all OK-need help finding best ones (pls RT!)</p>&mdash; Andrew Trice (@andytrice) <a href="https://twitter.com/andytrice/status/534736921814372353">November 18, 2014</a></blockquote>

I RTed it to help spread the word, but I thought I'd blog it here as well and see if folks could share their thoughts in the comments. This will hopefully reach a greater audience and let people have a bit more room to comment. If you manage a conference, I don't mind you sharing, just be sure to mention that in the comment.

As it stands, I was avoiding a lot of conferences over the past six months because of my adoptions, so I'm hoping to attend/present at more next year. You would be helping me as well.
