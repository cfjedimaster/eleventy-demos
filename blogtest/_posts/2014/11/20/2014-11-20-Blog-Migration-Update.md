Just a quick note. I've mentioned that I'm in the process of migrating the blog to a new platform (Wordpress). As part of that migration, I've went ahead and switched to Disqus. I'm still working on my export script (I'll share that when done) and since it will take up to 24 hours for the data to migrate (when I actually get the migration script even done!) I thought I'd take the plunge and enable it now.

However - that leaves me with having to display both the "old" comments (all 50,000+ of them) along with Disqus. I've done that now. Basically I just added the embed and removed the "Add Comment" form. I also put a little note so it was (hopefully) a bit obvious as to what in the heck was happening.

I know some folks aren't a fan of Disqus, but, going forward, this helps me make the blog a bit more migratable. (That's not a word and my editor is going to fuss at me. ;)
