<p>
A reader asked what I'd recommend in terms of a good book for learning HTML5 and after realizing I had no idea, I thought I'd post it here and let my smart readers (yes I'm buttering you up) have a say. To be clear, the reader is looking for books. In general I'd easily recommend the <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org">Mozilla Developer Network</a> for this information online, but obviously you can't (shouldn't) print that out.

So, what do recommend?
