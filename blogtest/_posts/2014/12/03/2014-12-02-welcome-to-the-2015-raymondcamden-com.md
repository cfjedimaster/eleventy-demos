Ok, so it technically isn't 2015 yet, but welcome to the new blog. Regular readers know I've been planning this for a few weeks now and this morning I decided to go forward with the update. I am <strong>100%</strong> sure some things will break, and I ask for your patience while I work out a few kinks. I plan another post talking about the migration and what I did, but for now, welcome. 

At the end of the day, I figure my readers care about what I say, not how I say it, so hopefully this will change won't impact that.

Hopefully I'll have some other big changes to announce soon as well. ;)

Oh - as an FYI, the RSS feed has been updated. Please change to the new URL.
