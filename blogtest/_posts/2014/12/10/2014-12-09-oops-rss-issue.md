So while I (believe) I've tackled the uptime issues here, looks like I screwed up my RSS feed a bit. I just fixed it, so <a href="http://www.coldfusionbloggers.org">ColdFusion Bloggers</a> will pick it up and anyone who subscribed to the feed will also get the last set of entries. 

As a reminder, the feed is here: <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/raymondcamdensblog">http://feeds.feedburner.com/raymondcamdensblog</a>. If you want to subscribe to the feed to get email notifications simply use the form on the right hand side of the blog.
