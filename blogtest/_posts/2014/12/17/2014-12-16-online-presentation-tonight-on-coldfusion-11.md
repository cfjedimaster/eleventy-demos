I'll be giving an online presentation tonight to a user group on ColdFusion 11. As I normally do when I present like this, I asked the user group manager if he minded me opening it up to anyone and he agreed it was ok. I'll give priority to the user group for questions, but if you are free tonight and want to watch me present on ColdFusion, this is your opportunity. The presentation starts at 6PM Central and the link (requires Flash) is: <a href="http://experts.adobeconnect.com/raycffavorites/">http://experts.adobeconnect.com/raycffavorites/</a>.
