From now until January 6th, you can pick up my jQuery Mobile book, <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/jquery-mobile-web-development-essentials-second-edition">"jQuery Mobile Web Development Essentials"</a> for the grand total of five dollars. That's less than the price of a good beer at a hotel bar. Heck, that's less than the price of a <i>bad</i> beer at a hotel bar. There are a bunch of other books on sale as well. This sale only applies to the electronic book, but it is still a great deal.
