My latest article, <a href="http://developer.telerik.com/topics/case-study-javascript-code-improvement/">A Case Study in JavaScript Code Improvement</a>, has just been released on the Telerik Developer Network. Over the past year or so I've spent a lot of time thinking about what I call "201 Level" JavaScript/web development. The stuff above intro level and below Rockstar/Ninja Level. It is an area I think developers need more help with (myself included) and I've been trying to focus my writing/presenting on this general theme.

My article takes a simple project (my <a href="https://github.com/cfjedimaster/SWAPI-Wrapper">Star Wars API wrapper</a>) and discusses how I migrate it from a quick and dirty one-off project to something that is a bit more professional.

Let me know what you think!
