As readers know, I am a <i>huge</i> fan of alt-history. It has been a while since we've had any on TV (earlier seasons of Fringe), but I was stoked to discover this week that Amazon Prime has created a new adaptation of Philip K Dick's famous story, "The Man in the High Castle." While one of the more common alt-history types (Nazi Germany wins WWII), the story is quite fascinating and well worth a read. If you have Amazon Prime, you can watch the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/2015-Amazon-Pilots-Preview/dp/B00RSGFRY8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1421596938&sr=8-1&keywords=the+man+in+the+high+castle+pilot">premier</a> now.

From the beginning, I loved it. The title sequence (and sorry, this was the best quality I could find) is both eerie and cool at the same time.

The story takes place in a America that is split between Japan and Germany with a neutral zone between them. The world-building is done <strong>very</strong> well.

I found myself pausing multiple times just so I could see all the peculiarities of Nazi/Japanese America.

Some of the best parts though were more subtle. As one of the main characters crosses the country, you get snippets of this America that are chilling. 

Right now it is just a pilot and I'm not sure if Amazon will pick it up for a series but I sure hope they do. (And hey, maybe we can do a Kickstarter for a new Sliders while we're at it?)
