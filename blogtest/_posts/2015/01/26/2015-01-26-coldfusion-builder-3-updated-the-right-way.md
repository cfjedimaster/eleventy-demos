About two weeks ago I <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/2015/01/12/coldfusion-builder-3-updated-and-i-bet-you-didnt-know">blogged</a> about how Adobe had updated ColdFusion Builder but had - oddly - not used the regular Eclipse update mechnism to distribute the update. Instead the expectation was that users should redownload the <i>entire</i> product again.

While I was happy as heck to see installers updated (that makes your post-installation experience a bit nicer imo), I couldn't understand why they didn't release an updater. 

Well I'm happy to say Adobe released the update the <strong>right</strong> way. You can now update your Builder directly in the editor itself. To be honest, none of the bug fixes were things that impacted me, but you should check the <a href="http://blogs.coldfusion.com/post.cfm/update-released-for-coldfusion-builder-3">blog post</a> to see if they impact you.

On the off chance you may not know how to check for updates in Eclipse (come on, Eclipse is simple, right?), just go to the Help menu and select <code>Check for Updates</code>.
