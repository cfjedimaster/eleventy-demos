Just a quick reminder that if you previously subscribed to my blog to get new posts by email, that feature went away when I changed to Wordpress. I'm using Feedburner for my RSS feed now and they allow you to subscribe. Just follow this <a href="https://feedburner.google.com/fb/a/mailverify?uri=RaymondCamdensBlog&loc=en_US">link</a> and you're good to go.

And as another aside - if you like what you read here, consider visiting my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/wishlist/2TCL1D08EZEYE">Amazon Wishlist</a>, and if you do, <strong>let me know</strong>! I just got "Sleeping Dogs" for the PS4 and Amazon included no information about who got it for me. If it is you, dear reader, thank you!

p.s. I played "Sleeping Dogs" already on the XBox, it was one of the free games you get as part of XBox Live Gold, which is a <i>damn</i> nice perk and easily worth the cost of Gold. The game is fun as heck - kind of an Asian Gran Theft Auto. I'm looking forward to playing it again.
