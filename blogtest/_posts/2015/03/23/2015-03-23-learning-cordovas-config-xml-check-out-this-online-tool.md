If you are having trouble understanding how to use PhoneGap/Cordova's <a href="http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/4.0.0/config_ref_index.md.html#The{% raw %}%20config.xml%{% endraw %}20File">config.xml file</a>, or perhaps just want to see examples of what various options do, please check out Holly Schinsky's excellent new tool: <a href="http://devgirl.org/files/config-app/">Interactive Guide to PhoneGap config.xml</a>. 

<!--more-->

Her tool lets you browse a config.xml file and see documentation on each and every major feature. Even better, she includes lots of screen shots and animations to give you a visual idea of what certain settings change.

p.s. Ok, this isn't <i>new</i>, but I don't see a lot of people talking about it so I figured it deserved some press. ;)
