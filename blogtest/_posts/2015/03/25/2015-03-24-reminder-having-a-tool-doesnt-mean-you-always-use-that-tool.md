Earlier this week Rebecca Murphy wrote an article about what she considers a "baseline" for JavaScript developers: <a href="http://rmurphey.com/blog/2015/03/23/a-baseline-for-front-end-developers-2015/">A Baseline for Front-End [JS] Developers: 2015</a>. It's a good article and I highly recommend reading it, but some of the comments raised an issue that I've seen in our community lately that I wanted to address.

It is an <i>incredible</i> time to be a web developer. That isn't to say we don't have a lot of problems, just that our field has grown in leaps and bounds over the past five years or so. JavaScript, and web standards in general, have created a rich playground for us to build not only web sites, but mobile and desktop apps as well. When I started, here were my tools:

<a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Untitled-drawing.png"><img src="https://static.raymondcamden.com/images/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Untitled-drawing.png" alt="Old school web dev" width="642" height="295" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5882" /></a>

At a high level, web developers have access to:

<ul>
<li>Multiple different editors targeting multiple different types of web developers/designers. Everything from, yes, Notepad, to <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/3">Sublime Text</a> to <a href="http://brackets.io/">Brackets</a> to <a href="http://www.adobe.com/Dreamweaver">Dreamweaver</a> and vi.</li>
<li>Browsers that are far more standards complaint than in the past and ship with incredible debugging tools baked in.</li>
<li>Command lines tools like <a href="http://yeoman.io/">Yeoman</a> and <a href="http://bower.io/">Bower</a> to help generate new applications and work with dependencies.</li>
<li>Testing and linting frameworks like <a href="http://jasmine.github.io/">Jasmine</a> and <a href="http://jshint.com/">JSHint</a> to help ensure the quality of your code.</li>
<li>Automation tools like <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a> and <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a> that relieve you from repeating manual steps.</li>
<li>Libraries that cover every possible front-end need from <a href="http://momentjs.com/">date manipulation</a> to <a href="https://github.com/jhuckaby/webcamjs">web cam sharing</a> to <a href="http://phaser.io/">game development</a>.</li>
<li>MVC frameworks like <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> and <a href="http://emberjs.com/">Ember</a> to help build larger and more complex applications.</li>
</ul>

The amount of options we have now is incredible. And - admittedly - overwhelming. No one can try to stay on top of this and no one should even try. <strong>That's not the point.</strong>

Having a tool does not mean you need to use it. A tool is there to help you when you have a problem, and you know what? Life provides plenty of problems without you needing to add more to them.

As a web developer, you cannot expect to know everything, or even a sizable percentage of everything. What your goal should be is to stay aware of our world in terms of what types of solutions exist. The goal is knowing what a tool is and what problems it solves - not being an expert in every tool.

I know, for example, that there are some great tools for generating apps and scaffolding. But I don't need them now. When I start a new project, I'm not going to force myself to use them because they solve a problem <strong>I do not have!</strong> Keep that in mind.

There's a lot of opinions out there about how you should be building. I'm certainly someone who's been know to share his opinions as well. But at the end of the day - you need to focus on a process that makes you and your team successful.
