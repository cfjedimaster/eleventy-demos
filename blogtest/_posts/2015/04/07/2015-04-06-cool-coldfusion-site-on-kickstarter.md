SPY, a "real world, live action" game, is up on Kickstarter - <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1186555722/spy-real-world-live-action-espionage">SPY: Real World, Live-Action Espionage</a>. I'm sharing this because the back end for the game is all built in ColdFusion. It looks like a pretty interesting idea!
