After a <i>very</i> long dry spell (thank you again, Adobe, for consigning me to technical writing), I'll be back on stage next week at <a href="http://fluentconf.com/javascript-html-2015">FluentConf 2015</a>. FluentConf is easily one of the best technical conferences around. Last time I checked the schedule, I pretty much wanted to attend <strong>every single session</strong>. If you are in the area, or can make it, I highly recommend attending. And what about me? I'll be speaking on <a href="http://ionicframework.com">Ionic</a> at 11:15. Full details of my session may be found here: <a href="http://fluentconf.com/javascript-html-2015/public/schedule/detail/38903">http://fluentconf.com/javascript-html-2015/public/schedule/detail/38903</a>. You can find the complete schedule here: <a href="http://bit.ly/1O4fpaI">Fluent 2015 Schedule</a>.

And best of all - and only because I <i>really</i> like you - you can use this <strong>SUPER SECRET CODE</strong> for a 20% discount. To make you work for it, I've hidden it here: <span style="display:none">FRIEND</span>. If you can defeat my super secret hiding technique, you can have the code.
