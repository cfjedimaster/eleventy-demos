On May 4th (hmm, that's a special day, isn't it?) I'll be giving an online presentation on the <a href="http://ionicframework.com">Ionic framework</a> for O'Reilly Media. This will be at 12PM CST and will last for about one hour. You can sign up, for free, here: <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/pub/e/3407">Using Ionic with Cordova/PhoneGap</a>. I'll also have a special announcement during the presentation. Hope to see you there!
