One of my favorite companies, <a href="http://www.telerik.com">Telerik</a>, has published an article of mine on their developer network: <a href="http://developer.telerik.com/featured/the-epic-awesome-supremely-useful-data-attribute/">The Epic, Awesome &amp; Supremely Useful Data Attribute</a>. Yes, the title is a bit over the top, but hopefully it is useful to my readers. Check it out and let me know what you think. (Obviously you should comment there, not here. :)
