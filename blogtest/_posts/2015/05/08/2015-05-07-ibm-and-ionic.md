So I don't typically post links to press releases (I think my readers know I'm not that kinda guy), but I wanted to share one that I thought was pretty important. As you know, I've been doing a lot of posts recently involving <a href="http://www.ionicframework.com">Ionic</a> and <a href="http://www.ibm.com/mobilefirst/us/en/">MobileFirst</a>. You're going to see even more of those over the next few months. Today the I'm sharing the news that we've (we as in IBM, I can speak for IBM, right? I've been here 3 months) are announcing a partnership with the Ionic company. You can read the complete press release here:

<a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/46623.wss">IBM and Ionic Empower Business Users to Accelerate Mobile App Development</a>

And also the Ionic blog post here:

<a href="http://blog.ionic.io/ionic-creator-available-for-ibm-mobilefirst-platform-users/">Ionic Creator Available for IBM MobileFirst Platform Users</a>

In a nutshell, I think the takeaway from this is that IBM MobileFirst is an awesome product (admittedly I'm biased) to help support the back end services of your mobile app and Ionic is an awesome product (yeah, totally biased) for building the mobile app itself. Ensuring these two awesome things work together is a net win for developers. It is the very example of mixing your chocolate and peanut butter for development. Enjoy.
