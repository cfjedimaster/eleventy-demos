After a hiatus, the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/coldfusionmeetup/">Online ColdFusion Meetup</a> is now back! As you can tell by the title, this is a user group for ColdFusion developers that meets online only. Run by <a href="http://carehart.org/">Charlie Arehart</a>, it has a long history of great presenters and content, and since it is 100% free with no travel costs, it is definitely worth your time checking out. The next meeting will be on Thursday, May 28, and will be Charlie himself discussing updating ColdFusion servers: <a href="http://www.meetup.com/coldfusionmeetup/events/222404392/?a=ea1_grp&rv=ea1&_af=event&_af_eid=222404392">"Updating/HotfÂ­ixing ColdFusion: Tips and Traps" with Charlie Arehart</a>.
