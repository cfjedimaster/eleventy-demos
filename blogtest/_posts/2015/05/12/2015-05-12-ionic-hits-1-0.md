The title says it all - and I assume most folks heard about this on Twitter or via the Ionic blog, but on the wild chance you did not, today <a href="http://blog.ionic.io/announcing-ionic-1-0/">Ionic 1.0</a> was announced.

Don't forget you can easily update an existing Ionic project using <code>ionic lib update</code>. Check out this real example:

Be sure to read to the end of the <a href="http://blog.ionic.io/announcing-ionic-1-0/">announcement post</a> as they go into detail about what the future holds for the Ionic framework and platform.
