So apparently, <a href="http://formkeep.com">FormKeep</a> had a bug where on the free tier, I was sent emails for every form response on my contact form. It was supposed to be limited to 10. About 1.5 months ago they "fixed" this bug, and, yeah, I didn't know. I'm not too pleased with that, but, at least I've got my data in a CSV file. If you used my contact form and wondered why I never got back - that's why. Going to start responding to items over the next week or so. I'm also going to see if I can get SendGrid integration working here.
