So yesterday I flew, or, rather, attempted to fly, since apparently the weather forecast was apocalypse and I didn't now it. I actually made it to Texas, but my flight to Madison was canceled there. American Airlines rang me with a robo call to my Google Voice number, and Google helpfully parsed their audio into text for me:

<blockquote>

Bye yo operated by lawyers, american eagle, bye Dallas Fort Worth to Madison, is experiencing a delay and is now expected to depart at. Bye, yeah 9:20 PM, you within arrival. Love, bye yo 11:42 PM, bye yo line updates can be obtained by calling our automated flight system at 1(800) 242-4444 to hear the message again say repeat 8. Bye. Yeah.

I especially appreciate the "love, bye" part.
