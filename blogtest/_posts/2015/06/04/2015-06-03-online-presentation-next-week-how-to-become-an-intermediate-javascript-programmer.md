Luckily nothing has changed much during those years. (Ahem.) I've discovered that I'm probably not smart enough to reach the upper levels of JavaScript development. I've got a lot of respect for those who do, but frankly, I'm happy enough if I can simply be <strong>competent</strong> as a JavaScript programmer.

I've been thinking about what skills/traits/tools/etc make up a good intermediate JavaScript developer and next Wednesday (June 10) night I'll be giving a presentation to the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/ChicagolandCFUG/">Chicagoland ColdFusion User Group</a> on the topic. I'm not flying to Chicago, but instead will be giving the presentation online via Adobe Connect. The meeting opens up at 6:30 CST and I'll probably go for an hour. If you can't make it, I'll share the recording later. (I'm actually going on vacation the very next day, so I may be a bit slow in getting that post up.) The meeting URL is: <a href="http://experts.adobeconnect.com/ccfug-06-10-15/">http://experts.adobeconnect.com/ccfug-06-10-15/</a>.

Obviously, this will be <i>my</i> opinion on what practices developers should follow and I highly encourage folks to give their own opinions as well. In general, when I do presentations for user groups like this I give priority to questions from the local group, but I'll also try to answer questions from folks just in the Connect room as well.
