This course covers how to use JavaScript templating (duh) and goes deep into four different products: EJS, Handlebars, Dust, and Nunjucks. I also talk a bit about ES6 template strings. What makes this course great (imo) is that at the end of each section, I use a common sample application and show how to use that particular product. This gives you a great way to compare each of these products against each other. Anyway, I think this is a great course (again, duh) and I hope you do too!
