Next month I'll be speaking at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/ionic_dallas/">Dallas Ionic meetup</a>. I'll be there on July 7th and I'll be talking about the services Ionic provides. As you know, Ionic provides a great set of UI/UX components, but they are also working on services you can add to your application to make them more powerful. I'll be discussing Push and a new service that hasn't (as far as I know) been shown anywhere else yet. You can RSVP here: <a href="http://www.meetup.com/ionic_dallas/events/223045527/">http://www.meetup.com/ionic_dallas/events/223045527/</a>. I hope to see you there!
