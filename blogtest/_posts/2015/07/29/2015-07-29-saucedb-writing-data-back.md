Welcome to another post on my ongoing series exploring building an <a href="http://www.ionicframework.com/">Ionic</a> hybrid mobile app making use of Node.js running on <a href="https://ibm.biz/IBM-Bluemix">IBM Bluemix</a>. Today I'm going to talk about writing data back to the server. Spoiler - this won't be quite as cool as bringing sexy back. In my <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/2015/07/24/saucedb-handling-the-sauce-view">last post</a>, I described a few minor updates to help flesh out the views of the mobile app. This included building the "Sauce view" (sauce plus reviews) for the application. Today I built another major aspect of the application - actual review writing.

<!--more-->

Getting review writing working is actually a multistep process. Before you add a review, the application asks you to name the sauce you're going to review. The idea was to autocomplete on the name so you can quickly select one that already exists. I had built this functionality on the client side already (<a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/2015/07/15/saucedb-working-on-the-front-end">SauceDB â€“ Working on the front end</a>), so at this point, all I needed to do was actually get the server-side version of it working.

I began by creating a <a href="https://cloudant.com/for-developers/search/">Cloudant Search Index</a>. This is a pretty darn powerful tool. You simply create an index in your database of the field you want to search and their API will use a Lucene search engine to interface with the data. 

Here is the index I created. My data consists of Sauces with names, so I simply index the name. I want to get the name back in searches, so I tell the index to include the value.

This worked well enough, but it took me a good hour of banging my head against the wall to get search working. Why? In the term area, you need to include a field. So for example, this returns nothing:

<img src="https://static.raymondcamden.com/images/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/shot26.png" alt="shot2" width="407" height="156" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6549" />

But when I added the actual field name, "name", it worked:

<a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/shot33.png"><img src="https://static.raymondcamden.com/images/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/shot33.png" alt="shot3" width="600" height="269" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6550" /></a>

Ok, so that's cool. I then needed to work with this on the server-side in my Node code:

<pre><code class="language-javascript">app.get(ibmconfig.getContextRoot()+'/search/:term', function(req, res) {
	console.log("searching for "+req.params.term);
	//we need to manipulate term a bit
	var term = "name:" + req.params.term;
	term += "*";
	console.log(term);
	db.search('SauceName','SauceName', {% raw %}{q:term}{% endraw %}, function(err, results) {
		if(err) throw err;
		var result = [];
		for(var i=0;i&lt;results.rows.length;i++) {
			//console.dir(results.rows[i]);
			result.push({% raw %}{id:results.rows[i].id, name:results.rows[i].fields.name}{% endraw %});	
		}
		console.dir(result);
		res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');
		res.json(result);		
	});
});</code></pre>

You can see I do a bit of manipulation on the input and then just use the Search API provided by the Cloudant Node module. So back in the client-side code, I then removed my mock code in the service layer and replaced it with Cloud Code calls back to Node:

<pre><code class="language-javascript">var searchSauce = function(term) {
	var deferred = $q.defer();
	term = term.toLowerCase();
				
    cc.get("/search/"+term).then(function(data){
		data = JSON.parse(data);			
		deferred.resolve(data);
		
    },function(err){
        console.log(err);
    });
	
	return deferred.promise;

}</code></pre>

And that was pretty much it. (I did change the view template a tiny bit.) Here it is running in the emulator with real data powering the autocomplete.

Ok, so at this point, we load up a form to let you write your review. I had already built this out and included logic to recognize a new sauce via an existing one. So for example, an existing sauce just asks you to write the text and select the rating.

<img src="https://static.raymondcamden.com/images/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/iOS-Simulator-Screen-Shot-Jul-29-2015-5.13.27-PM.png" alt="iOS Simulator Screen Shot Jul 29, 2015, 5.13.27 PM" width="750" height="657" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6552 imgborder" />

Whereas a new sauce requires a name and company:

Alrighty... so... here comes the fun part. We now need to communicate back to the server. That's a simple post. But remember that we need to include information in the post that signifies that the user is logged in. I already described how I'm using <a href="https://github.com/ccoenraets/OpenFB">OpenFB</a> for Facebook integration and I've got a login token I copy to $rootScope. I also blogged (<a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/2015/07/10/combining-client-side-social-login-and-server-side-authorization-with-cordova-and-node">Combining client-side social login and server-side authorization with Cordova and Node</a>) about how you can combine client-side login with server-side authorization in Node. All I had to do was bring those parts together.

First - I built in my login middleware. This will check the Facebook token sent by the user to ensure it is valid. I also want to get user information including their name and profile picture. I store all of this in a Node session so I don't have to fetch it again.

<pre><code class="language-javascript">function secure(req, result, next) {    
    if(req.session.tokenchecked) {
        next();   
    } else {
		console.log('need to check token ');
		var token = req.body.token;
		//check to ensure token is good
		https.get('https://graph.facebook.com/me?fields=email,name,picture&access_token='+token, function(res) {
			var str = '';
			res.on('data', function(chunk) {
				str += chunk;
			})
			res.on('end', function() {
				var response = JSON.parse(str);
				//store name and image
				console.dir(response);
				if(response.id) {
					console.log('good');
					req.session.tokenchecked = 1;
					req.session.name = response.name;
					req.session.img = response.picture.data.url;
					next();
				} else {
					console.log('bad');
					result.send("0");
				}
			})
		}).end();
	
    }
}</code></pre>

Now let's look at adding a review. This has to handle two cases - adding a new sauce with a review as well as adding a review to an existing sauce. My code does not validate that a sauce name is unique. I figure... that's a bit too much for now. 

<pre><code class="language-javascript">app.post(ibmconfig.getContextRoot()+'/addreview', secure, function(req, res) {
	console.log("adding review "+JSON.stringify(req.body));
	
	var newReview = {
		posted:new Date(),
		rating:req.body.rating,
		text:req.body.text,
			user:{
				name:req.session.name,
				img:req.session.img
			}
	};
	console.log("New Review:", JSON.stringify(newReview));

	//So first q, is this a new sauce?
	
	if(!req.body.sauce.id) {
		console.log('i need to make a new sauce');
		
		db.insert({
			name:req.body.sauce.name,
			company:req.body.sauce.company,
			avgrating:newReview.rating,
			reviews:[newReview]		
		}, function(err, body) {
			if(err) throw err;
			res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');
			res.json(body.id);		
		});	
	} else {
		//not new, so get, then add	
		db.get(req.body.sauce.id, function(err, body) {
			if(err) throw err;
			body.reviews.push(newReview);

			//calculate avgrate
			var totalRating = 0;
			for(var i=0;i&lt;body.reviews.length;i++) {
				totalRating += parseInt(body.reviews[i].rating,10);	
			}
			body.avgrating = totalRating/body.reviews.length;
			db.insert(body, function(err, body) {
				if(err) throw err;
				res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');
				res.json(body.id);		
			});	
					
		});	
	}
});</code></pre>

And that's it. Here's my last review:

There's still plenty of rough edges in this code. For example, going back to the feed doesn't get a fresh copy. I'm going to fix that with a cool Ionic widget in my next post. There's also some view caching going on that needs cleaning. You get the idea. But it's getting there!
