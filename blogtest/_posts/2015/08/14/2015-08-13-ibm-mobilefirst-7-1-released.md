I'm happy to announce that today we've released <a href="https://ibm.biz/BluemixMobileFirst">MobileFirst 7.1</a>!

Note - that is not official IBM MobileFirst branding. Also note - this is why I'm not in branding.

This release includes a pretty significant update to how hybrid apps are developed. You can read more about those updates here: <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/mobilefirstplatform/documentation/getting-started-7-1/foundation/hello-world/integrating-mfpf-sdk-in-cordova-applications/">Integrating IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation SDK in Cordova applications</a>. You can also peruse the <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/mobilefirstplatform/documentation/getting-started-7-1/">Getting Started</a> docs if you've never looked at MobileFirst at all.

Evaluating MobileFirst is 100% free. You can download the developer edition here: <a href="http://www.ibm.com/mobilefirst/us/en/downloads/">http://www.ibm.com/mobilefirst/us/en/downloads/</a>. It is <strong>not</strong> terribly clear where to go next on this page. Scroll down till you see this:

Along with improving support for hybrid mobile apps (and yes, that includes <a href="http://www.ionicframework.com">Ionic</a>), MobileFirst will be available on <a href="https://ibm.biz/IBM-Bluemix">Bluemix</a> as well. This will make setting up the server even easier then it is now. (I'm not seeing it available right now but it should be up relatively soon.) 

I gave a presentation on 7.1 yesterday and I plan on turning that content into a series of blog posts and videos... but not today. I'm flying home today so I'll be in the air for most of the day.
