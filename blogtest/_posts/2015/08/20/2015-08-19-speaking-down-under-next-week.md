Tomorrow I hop on a plane and head down under. I'll be going to both Australia and New Zealand. In Australia, I'll be speaking at two multi hour events. I'll be covering <a href="http://cordova.apache.org">Apache Cordova</a>, <a href="http://www.ionicframework.com">Ionic</a>, and <a href="https://ibm.biz/BluemixMobileFirst">MobileFirst</a>. Both sessions are a three hour block with an hour focused on each topic.  I'll be bringing some Ionic schwag with me as well as the spirit of America, so please attend if you can!

The first event is in Melbourne on August 24th: <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Melbourne-IBM-Open-Cloud-Meetup/events/224710657/">Cordova/Ionic/MobileFirst</a>.

The second event is in Sydney on August 26th: <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Sydney-IBM-Open-Cloud-Meetup/events/224710686/">Cordova/Ionic/MobileFirst</a>

Both events are completely free, so please show up!
