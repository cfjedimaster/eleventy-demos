<img src="https://static.raymondcamden.com/images/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/02184.png" alt="02184" width="170" height="276" class="aligncleft size-full wp-image-6759" style="float:left;padding-right: 10px;padding-bottom:10px" /> I'm happy to announce that my latest video series for <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/">O'Reilly</a> is now available: <a href="http://www.infiniteskills.com/training/client-side-data-storage-for-web-developers.html">Client-Side Data Storage for Web Developers</a>. This series covers everything from cookies to IndexedDB and all the fun stuff in between. The link there is for Infinite Skills, with ORA bought a while back. If you find my video via oreilly.com itself it still shows up as not available so there may be a bit of a lag there between web site updates. 

I think this is a great video series, and I'm also working on an e-book version of it as well that will be released pretty soon. As always though, if you have feedback, I want to hear it.
