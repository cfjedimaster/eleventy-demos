As I've mentioned before, I've got a few videos available at O'Reilly (<a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920034971.do">JavaScript Templating</a> and <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920043638.do">Client-Side Data Storage</a>). You can now get my "JavaScript Templating" video as part of a bigger series called <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/category/learning-path/beginning-javascript.do">"Beginning JavaScript"</a>:

This video series consists of three parts. First is Semmy Purewal giving an introduction to JavaScript. Next up is my video. Then it ends with Douglas Crockford giving a "Master Class" in JavaScript. 

Frankly, I'm the smaller/lesser cool part of this series, which is why I say I'm honored to be a part of it. But it looks like a great package in general for folks looking to get a great set of content for learning JavaScript.

As always, I'm happy to take any feedback on my videos, positive or negative. Just drop me a line.
