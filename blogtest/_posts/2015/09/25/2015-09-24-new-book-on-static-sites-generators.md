I'm speaking on it Sunday at <a href="http://www.ncdevcon.com">NCDevCon</a>. My buddy Brian Rinaldi, another SSG fan, released a free e-book today on SSGs that you can download from O'Reilly right now:

<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/web-platform/free/static-site-generators.csp">Static Site Generators: Modern Tools for Static Website Development</a>

I did a tech review on this book and it is a great introduction to SSGs. You can read it in about an hour, and it is well worth your time.
