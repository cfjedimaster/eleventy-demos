Today's presentation was a bit rough without power, but I want to thank everyone who attended and worked with me to - well - make it work. I really appreciate it. The slide deck can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/cfjedimaster/Static-Sites">https://github.com/cfjedimaster/Static-Sites</a>. If you want to watch a recorded version of this preso (slightly older), you can view the one I did for O'Reilly here: <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/pub/e/3438">Static site generators: Why use them and how they work</a>
