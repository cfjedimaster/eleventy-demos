Every year or so (although sometimes later than planned), I like to remind people that November is National Adoption Month. My wife and I have adopted six times over the past fifteen years. We adopted three times from South Korea and three times from China. It is an incredible experience - and "incredible" in every way possible. Joyous, scary, exciting, nerve-wracking, etc. My wife and I both advocate for adoption (both international and domestic) and <strong>highly</strong> encourage people to look into if they are in any way interested. Here are just a few random links for more information and if you have any questions, just drop me a comment below. (And if it is something you would rather discuss in private, you can drop me an email too.)
