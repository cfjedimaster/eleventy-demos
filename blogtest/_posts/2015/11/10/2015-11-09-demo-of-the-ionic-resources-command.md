One of the cool little "side" features of the Ionic CLI is the <code>resources</code> command. If you've never seen it in action, it lets you create a simple source icon and splash screen and then generate icons and splash screens for the 500 different variants supported by Apache Cordova. This isn't a <i>new</i> feature, but I've been meaning to create a video tutorial of this in action so folks could see what it does. Thanks go to Mike Hartington for helping me prepare this video!
