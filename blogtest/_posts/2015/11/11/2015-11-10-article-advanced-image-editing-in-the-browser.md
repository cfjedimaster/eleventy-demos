Just a quick FYI that I've released a new article for the Telerik Developer Network: <a href="http://developer.telerik.com/featured/advanced-image-editing-in-the-browser/">Advanced Image Editing in the Browser</a>. The article discusses how you can add tooling to a web site to let non-technical users do basic (and sometimes advanced!) image editing directly in the browser.
