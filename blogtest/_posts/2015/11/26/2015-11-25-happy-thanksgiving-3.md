I'm spending my day with my family and am incredibly thankful for them. I wanted to quickly thank everyone who reads this blog, comments, and helps make me a better developer. Thank you to the Apache Cordova team, the Ionic folks, and everyone else who helps make the tools that let me get stuff done.
