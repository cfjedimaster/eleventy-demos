Yep, another lame, non-tech post. Sorry (not sorry). Today's post is my list of books read in 2015. I record my books via <a href="http://www.goodreads.com">Goodreads</a> which has a set of widgets that - in theory - I could use - but every single one of them is broken. Oddly - dev tools didn't reveal why they were so broken. So I decided to do something lame. I took their cool "year in review" blog post, snapped a picture of it with Firefox's <code>screenshot</code> command, and pasted it here. You won't be able to click on any book and order them via Amazon, but I figure we're all capable of searching, right?

I'm rather proud of the number of books I read - and even happier that there were so few stinkers.
