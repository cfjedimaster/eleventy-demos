Live in NYC? Want to hear me speak about <a href="http:///www.ionicframework.com">Ionic</a> services? Want to just heckle me instead? Come check out my presentation to the Ionic NYC meetup group next Wednesday: 

<a href="http://www.meetup.com/Ionic-NYC-Meetup/events/227161281/">Ionic Services - Raymond Camden</a>

This is my first time presenting to this group and I plan on bringing some schwag as well as a copy of my Apache Cordova book to give away. See you there!
