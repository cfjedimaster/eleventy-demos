Nothing much to say here really except that I've released another article for the 
[Telerik Developer Network](http://developer.telerik.com/) - ["Leveling Up Your JavaScript"](http://developer.telerik.com/featured/leveling-up-your-javascript/). 

As you can probably guess, the article discusses how to improve your JavaScript skills. This is not meant to replace any of the good books out there. Rather, this is a high level view at what helped *me* improve my own skills. It is focused on a few specific strategies that I found useful for becoming a better developer.

And to be clear - I'm talking about a "better developer", not a "great" developer or heck, even "good" - just better. Becoming better at JavaScript (and web development in general) has been a fun, and sometimes painful, process. So I've tried to provide some guidance as to what worked well for me. Obviously these tips may not work for you, but I hope they provide some useful suggestions for you. 

Please let me know what you think in the comments on the article!
