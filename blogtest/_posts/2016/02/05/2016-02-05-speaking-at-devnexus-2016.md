Just a quick note to let folks know I'll be speaking at [DevNexus](https://devnexus.com/s/index) in ten days. I'm giving a presentation on [Ionic](http://www.ionicframework.com) services and will also be covering my coworker [Andy Trice](http://www.tricedesigns.com/)'s presentation on cognitive computing and mobile applications.

Unfortunately it looks like the conference is already sold out, but if you're attending and read this blog, please come by and say hello. I'll be bringing a copy of my last two books with me and will pretty much give them out to the first person who asks for them. Hope to see you there!
