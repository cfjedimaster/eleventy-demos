I was honored to be chosen to speak at this year's [PhoneGap Day](http://pgday.phonegap.com/us2016/), but honestly, even if I wasn't chosen to speak, I would have tried like heck to get there. I missed last year, but every PhoneGap Day I've been too has been *incredible*. If you missed it, all of the presentations will be available online via the [PhoneGap blog](http://pgday.phonegap.com/us2016/). You can also read their 
excellent [recap](http://phonegap.com/blog/2016/02/09/recapping-phonegap-day-us-2016/) of the event too. 

My session is available now, and you can watch it below.

In my session, I talked a bit about one of the things PhoneGap/Cordova developers need to keep in mind - internationalization. My focus was specifically on number and date formatting (hey, I only had twenty minutes!) and I demonstrated how you can use the [Globalization](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cordova-plugin-globalization) plugin to achieve this. 

If you have any questions about what I demonstrated, just leave me a comment below!
