Just a quick note to let folks know I'll be giving a webinar next week on browser dev tools. This will be for the [Northern Virginia ColdFusion Users Group](http://www.meetup.com/nvcfug/) but will be open to the public. If you can't make it, it will be up on YouTube afterwards and I'll post the link back to this blog post. 

This session will introduce the basics of using the browser's developer tools to help you debug/test your web applications. Most likely this will only be appropriate for beginning developers but all are welcome.

Here are the details:

Hope to see you there!
