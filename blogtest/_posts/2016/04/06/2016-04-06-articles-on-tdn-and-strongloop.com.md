Just a quick note to share that I've been published again on the [Telerik Developer Network](http://developer.telerik.com). My latest article discusses learning JavaScript by "playing", or writing short bits of code, versus traditional book or classroom learning.

["Tools to Learn JavaScript by Doing"](http://developer.telerik.com/featured/tools-learn-javascript/) talks about various sites, tutorials, etc. that have you learn, or at least practice, JavaScript by either trying to solve coding challenges or get various tests to pass. I find this type of learning to be fascinating as it is much more active than just reading a book or attending a conference session. So I wrote up a few suggestions for things to try in this space and I hope folks find it useful. 

I'm also now writing for the [StrongLoop blog](http://strongloop.com/strongblog). I won't update my blog here every time I post there, but I strongly urge my readers who want to learn more about StrongLoop, LoopBack, and Node.js in general to sbuscribe there as well. My latest article there, ["Examples of Validations for LoopBack Models"](https://strongloop.com/strongblog/examples-of-validations-for-loopback-models/), discusses some specific examples of validation within LoopBack. I'm currently working on an article now that deals with the ORM API and relationships.
