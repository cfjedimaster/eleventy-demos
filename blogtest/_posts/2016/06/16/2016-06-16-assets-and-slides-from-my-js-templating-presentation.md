As a reminder, if you want to learn more about this topic, you can pick up my O'Reilly video
series on the topic here: <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920034971.do">JavaScript Templating</a>. I cover four different products in depth as well as ES6 Template Strings. The video runs for a bit over 2 hours and all source code is included.
