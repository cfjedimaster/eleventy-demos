For those who couldn't make the [NCDevCon](http://ncdevcon.com/) (which is a shame, it is a great conference!), here is the recording of my presentation on Apache Cordova and "things they didn't tell you." As I say right away in the beginning, everything I cover are *absolutely* things that folks talk about now, but it's sometimes missed in the rush to get things done quickly. 

As always, I love your feedback and questions, just ask in the comment below.
