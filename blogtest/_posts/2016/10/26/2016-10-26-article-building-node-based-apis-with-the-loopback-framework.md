Just a quick note to let readers know I've published another article over on the [Telerik Developer Network](http://developer.telerik.com) - ["Building Node-based APIs with the LoopBack Framework"](http://developer.telerik.com/featured/building-node-based-apis-loopback-framework). As you can tell by the title, this is just an intro to LoopBack, something I've covered multiple times on this blog, but what you may find interesting is that I built a [NativeScript](https://www.nativescript.org/) front-end to the LoopBack back end. It isn't anything necessarily special, and that's due to LoopBack being so simple to use, but you may find it interesting.
