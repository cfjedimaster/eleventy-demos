Forgive the somewhat late notice, but I'll be speaking next week at [Ortus Developer Week](https://www.ortussolutions.com/odw), a 100% free, online conference run by the fine folks at Ortus Solutions. 

<!--more--> 

While primarily a ColdFusion-related conference, you'll find some non-CF topics there as well. My topic is ["Going Static"](https://www.ortussolutions.com/odw/sessions/77) and I'll be discussing one of my favorite topics - static web sites. My talk is at 11AM CST, Monday the 14th.
