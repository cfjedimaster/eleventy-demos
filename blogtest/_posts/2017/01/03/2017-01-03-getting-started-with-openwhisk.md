For folks who have been reading my [OpenWhisk](/tags/openwhisk) blog entries this past week or so, I've started working on some videos
that demonstrate what I've been covering so far. I only have three done currently, and two cover material I've already done, but I thought
it might be a useful addition to what I've demonstrated on the blog.

The first simply demonstrates the CLI and creating/calling actions:

The second demonstrates how to work with asynchronous actions (and includes the [Star Wars API!](http://swapi.co)):

The third one discusses how to debug your actions when you screw up. And I mean you since I never screw up in JavaScript. Or anything else. Ever. Honest.

You can also bookmark the [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_z-rqJYNijo3BzyBb8mQXYqDAwTbprW7). I'm going to record another one
today and hopefully more soon.
