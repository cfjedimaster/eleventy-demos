Guess what I got my grubby little hands on?

![A new book!](https://static.raymondcamden.com/images/2017/5/ionic2book2.jpg)

Yep, a brand-spanking new book on the latest version of Ionic by [Chris Griffith](https://chrisgriffith.wordpress.com/). I had the distinct pleasure of being one of the technical reviewers for this book and I enjoyed it quite a lot. I felt like I "knew" Ionic 2 going in, but obviously didn't know everything, and I definitely discovered some great new tips while editing. I also really like Chris' use of one main sample application throughout the book. The reader really gets a chance to see it grow and expand with new features. Pick it up by clicking the link below (and yep, that's an affiliate link so if you buy, I get a few cents, thanks!)
