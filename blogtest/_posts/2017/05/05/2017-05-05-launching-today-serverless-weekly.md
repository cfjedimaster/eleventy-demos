The title says it all. I've been a fan of the [Cooperpress](https://cooperpress.com/) weeklies for sometime now and I'm happy to say I'm helping them launch a new one - [Serverless Status](https://serverless.email/). (Yeah, I called it "Serverless Weekly" above, but you get the idea. ;) As with the other weeklies, this a free newsletter providing interesting links concerning serverless stuff. This will include blog posts, demos, product announcements and more. I'll be contributing to it, so feel free to DM or @ me suggestions. 

You can sample the content (and sign up) now at https://serverless.email.
