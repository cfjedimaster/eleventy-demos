So this kinda snuck up on me (in terms of how quickly it got produced I mean ;), but I'm happy to announce my first course for Lynda.com (AKA LinkedIn Learning):

[Learning Ionic](https://www.lynda.com/Ionic-tutorials/Learning-Ionic-Basics/562925-2.html)

It's a short course meant to introduce folks to Ionic 2 (but will work just fine with Ionic 3/X) and I think it's a rather 'gentle' introduction for folks who have only seen Ionic 1 so far and are a bit worried about the jump to Ionic/Angular 2. Here are topics covered:

* Making a default application
* Exploring application files
* Adding navigation and UI components
* Theming
* Using a hard-coded detail view
* Adding the SW provider via CLI
* Making a list and a details page
* Adding a loading widget
* Using native and market Ionic resources

Anyway, I think it's good. But obviously I'm biased. ;) As always, check it out, let me know what you think (positive or negative), and enjoy. I know I've been laser focused on serverless lately, and that certainly isn't because I'm done with Ionic!
