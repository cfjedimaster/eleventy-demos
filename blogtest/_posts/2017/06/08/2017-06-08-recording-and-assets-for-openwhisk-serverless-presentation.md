Thank you to everyone who attended my webinar yesterday. For those who missed it, you can view the recording by going here: https://engage.vevent.com/index.jsp?eid=556&seid=90389. The UI seems to imply you will be registering for a new event, but ignore that. Once you get into the system you will be watching the recording of my session. For those who wanted the demos and slides, you can get them via the link below. I used a PDF export of the slides.
