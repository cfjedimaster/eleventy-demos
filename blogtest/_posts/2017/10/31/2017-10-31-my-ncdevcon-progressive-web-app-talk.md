A few weeks ago I gave my first talk on progressive web apps (PWAs) at [NCDevCon](http://ncdevcon.com/). I'm really happy they accepted my submission since it forced me to finally sit down and begin wrapping my head around the core concepts. While I certainly don't think I'm an expert yet, I think I gave a decent talk that focused on the practical aspects of PWAs and what's actually involved when creating them. You be the judge.

As always, I would love to hear feedback on the talk. Let me know what you think by leaving a comment below.
