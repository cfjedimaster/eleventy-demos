I am *very* happy to announce that my new book, "Developing Serverless Applications - A Practical Introduction with Apache OpenWhisk." I believe that may win the prize for the most "wordy" title of any book I've written.

The best part is the price - 100% free. All you need to do is hop over to a [signup form](https://www-01.ibm.com/marketing/iwm/dre/signup?source=urx-20147&S_PKG=ov61476), register, and you'll get a copy of the PDF. It's a short book aimed at getting you up and running with serverless and OpenWhisk and will cover the basics of action creating, sequences, and making APIs. 

Here's the table of contents:

* Introduction
* OpenWhisk Basics
* Working with Actions
* Using OpenWhisk Actions
* Building Sequences
* Working with Packages
* Using Triggers and Rules
* Going Further with OpenWhisk

I hope this is helpful to folks. OpenWhisk was my introduction to serverless, and it's obviously my favorite so far (although I do plan on learning more about Lambda and Azure Functions).
