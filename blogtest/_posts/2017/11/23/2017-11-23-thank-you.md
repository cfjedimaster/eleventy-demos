For those of you outside America, today is Thanksgiving which is traditionally a day when we are extra thankful for the good things we have in life. I've got a lot to be thankful for in my life. I also want to share a quick thank you to all my readers who provide great feedback, awesome questions, and just make this worthwhile. Have a great day, love your friends and family, and please accept my thanks again!
