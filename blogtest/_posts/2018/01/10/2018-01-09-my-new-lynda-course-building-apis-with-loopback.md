I'm happy to announce the release of my latest Lynda.com course, [Building APIs with LoopBack](https://www.lynda.com/Node-js-tutorials/Welcome/630621/689210-4.html). This course introduces you to [LoopBack](https://loopback.io/) and walks you through building APIs as well as a sample application using those APIs. I cover customizations, security, and more. It's near two hours in length and would be a great way to learn the framework. You do *not* need to be an expert in Node to use LoopBack, so I definitely recommend it. I hope my readers find this useful, and as always, leave me some feedback about the course either at the site or down in the comments below. (As a reminder, I also have a [course on Ionic](https://www.lynda.com/Ionic-tutorials/Learning-Ionic-Basics/562925-2.html) as well!)

Here is the course outline:

* Introduction
* Introducing APIs with LoopBack
* Models
* Data Sources
* Security 
* Customizing LoopBack
* Filtering and Validating Data
* Demo LoopBack App
* Conclusion
