This will be a quick post. I wanted to share a few links for people who want to take a look at [Auth0 Webtask](https://webtask.io/), the serverless platform behind [Extend](https://auth0.com/extend). Some of these links will be obvious, some not, but hopefully they will be helpful for folks who want to learn more.

* First and foremost, start with the [docs](https://webtask.io/docs/101). I've been doing some edits here recently but in general, they are in good shape and will help you get started. 
* Don't forget the online [editor](https://webtask.io/docs/101). I really, *really* love my [editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and it is the primary tool I use for all my development, but the online editor is very well done and if you aren't sure you want to "commit" to installing the CLI, then I suggest simply working there to get started. The CLI has full parity with the editor so you can switch back and forth.
* There is a public Webtask slack at webtask-chat.slack.com. You can signup here: https://skynet.run.webtask.io/webtask-signup. I didn't even know this existed until a few days ago as it is a bit hidden in the "Contact Us" modal. I'll be making this more visible soon. 
* The [Auth0 Blog](https://auth0.com/blog/) has some great content (they even covered LoopBack multiple times!) including good articles on webtask. You can find Webtask specific entries here: https://auth0.com/blog/tags/webtask/. Be sure to click the "Older posts" button at the bottom as the first page of results is pretty short. 
* There is a [webtask workshop](https://github.com/auth0/webtask-workshop) that you do by yourself to get introduced to different parts of the platform.
* If you are already doing serverless with the Serverless framework, they support webtask too. You can read about that here: [Auth0 Webtasks - Introduction](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/webtasks/guide/intro/). I've not blogged on the Serverless framework yet. I hope to have a few entries on that in the next couple weeks.
* Finally, my current posts here on webtask may be found at the tag: https://www.raymondcamden.com/tags/webtask. Not a lot yet, but it will grow. :) You will see more posts on the official blog, but I'll be covering it here as well.

That's all for now and I hope this is helpful!
