I wasn't able to make this year's [VueConf US](http://us.vuejs.org/) (even though it was in my backyard), but luckily, some of the videos from the conference are online: 

https://www.vuemastery.com/conferences/vueconf-2018/opening-keynote-evan-you

Right now there's just 4 sessions, but they are *incredibly* good presentations including Rachel Nabor's on [Vue's transition](https://www.vuemastery.com/conferences/vueconf-2018/vue-in-motion-rachel-nabors) support for animations and Edd Yerburgh on [testing Vue apps](https://www.vuemastery.com/conferences/vueconf-2018/testing-vue-apps-edd-yerburgh). 

While at the site, take note of the "Notify me" button on the right. You can sign up there to be notified when new videos are added. From what I know, *all* the videos will be available eventually. Plus, if you sign up, the fine folks at [Vue Mastery](https://www.vuemastery.com/) will send you a Vue PDF cheat sheet that is *really* freaking nice:

It's two pages in length and I'm probably going to print it out for my home office. Actually disregard what I said above. If you don't feel like signing up for updates, you can still get the PDF here: https://www.vuemastery.com/pdf/Vue-Essentials-Cheat-Sheet.pdf. As I said, it is definitely worth downloading!
