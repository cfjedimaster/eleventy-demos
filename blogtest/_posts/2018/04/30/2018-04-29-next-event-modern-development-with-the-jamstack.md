First off - my apologies for being a bit quiet here. I had two trips in a row, some big things (good things) happening at work, and some projects that aren't necessarily blog worthy yet, but hopefully I'll have some cool stuff to share soon. 

With that out of the way, I'm happy to announce I'll be speaking at another [Certified Fresh](https://certifiedfreshevents.com/) event next month, ["Modern Web Development with the JAMStack"](https://certifiedfreshevents.com/events/jamstack/). This is a free online event on May 23rd at noon CST. 

No idea what the JAMStack is? Well obviously it's this:

Heh, if only. Imagine static site generators - but taken to the next level. Attend the free online session to get a much better introduction to the topic. I'll be speaking with Phil Hawksworth of Netlify (the fine folks who host this site) and covering some of the ways you can "bring dynamic back" to a static site. I hope to see you there!
