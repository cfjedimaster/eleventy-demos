So as I announced back in [April](https://www.raymondcamden.com/2018/04/20/getting-up-to-speed-with-vuejs), I'm giving an online course on Vue.js. The May course was cancelled but the June one for the 22nd is still on. 

[Getting Up to Speed with Vue.js](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/live-training/courses/getting-up-to-speed-with-vue-js/0636920182153/)
