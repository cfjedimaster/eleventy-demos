Just a quick note to let folks know that I'll be doing another online presentation next month (and in November as well) covering how to get into serverless using [Webtask](https://webtask.io). While Webtask is used for the platform, it's more meant to be a general introduction to serverless and I think you'll be able to take what you learn here and apply it to other platforms as well.

The next course will be October 8 at 11AM CST. You can find details here: [Learn Serverless Application Development with Webtask](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/live-training/courses/learn-serverless-application-development-with-webtask/0636920215011/)

There will be a second one held on November 13th as well. Here is the outline, but note that it may change as I develop the course.
