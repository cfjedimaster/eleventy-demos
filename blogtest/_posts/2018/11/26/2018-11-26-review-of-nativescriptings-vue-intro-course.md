Good morning programs, as I continue my journey into NativeScript via Vue, I thought I'd share a quick review of a new online course that may be of interest to people. ["NativeScript-Vue Introduction"](https://nativescripting.com/course/nativescript-vue-introduction/) is a great course that introduces people to both NativeScript and Vue development. It covers:

* Setting up your development environment
* Working with UI (this is perhaps the biggest topic for folks new to NativeScript)
* Working with Vue (obviously, and you do *not* need to know Vue before you start)
* Using Vue Components
* Adding Routing
* Styling

While you do not need to know Vue before you start, I would perhaps spend a bit of time going through the [introduction](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/) so you aren't going in completely blind. 

The course is very nicely paced with each section being roughly 2-3 minutes in length. This makes it much easier to learn at your own pace and spend some time playing around a bit while you learn. 

I also **really** like the video platform used on the site. It's one of the simplest platforms I've seen and I appreciate that it isn't too cluttered.

The course was created by [Alex Ziskind](https://twitter.com/digitalix), founder of the site itself, and you should definitely check out the other courses while you are there, although this is currently the only Vue-related one available. 

The course is priced at $49, which seems completely reasonable to me and worth the price. If you sign up and mention my name, you get absolutely nothing, but I still recommend you do so anyway.
