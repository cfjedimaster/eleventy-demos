Pardon what will be an *incredibly* short blog post, but as I don't want to assume all of my readers use Twitter and may have missed it, I recently did a podcast with the [Views on Vue](https://devchat.tv/views-on-vue) folks. You can find my episode here:

As a reminder, I'm happy to speak on any podcast out there - just send me an invite anytime!
