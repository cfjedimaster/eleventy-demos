<h1>Post</h1>

<p>This is just a reminder that I will be speaking at two upcoming ColdFusion conferences.</p>
<p>May 15-16th I'll be presenting at <a href="http://www.mxontherocks.com/">MX on the Rocks</a> in Denver. I'll be talking about CFCs, specifically tips and bugs to watch out. I also will have some (imho) cool examples to show.</p>
<p>June 21-22nd I'll be presenting at <a href="http://www.cfconf.org/cfun-03/">CFUN-03</a>. I'll be giving two talks there. First, my CFC presentation again (although in a slimmer format because of the time difference). I'll also be giving my Web Application Security talk.</p>
<p>All presentations will be available via my blog after the conferences.</p>
