<p>I'm not sure many people knew - but I was managing the Spectrasource site in my spare time since I left Macromedia. I am no longer at that job anymore - so the last gasps of my Spectra usage is now at an end.  I still think Spectra is a great product. With the right improvements and given enough time - it could have gone far. But to be honest, I know next to nothing about business.</p>
