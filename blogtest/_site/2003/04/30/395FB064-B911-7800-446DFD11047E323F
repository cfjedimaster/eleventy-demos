<p>I've released a set of custom tags that enable developers to quickly run speed tests. You can download the tags <a href="http://www.camdenfamily.com/morpheus/downloads/speed.zip">here</a>. As always, comments are appreciated. Note that, in general, I don't worry two often about speed. I mean, I try to write code that is quick - but if two options are only a tiny bit different in speed - nine times out of ten I think it's better to go with the more readable code. In general, I'd use this tool to look for <i>gross</i> differences in speed - not minor ones.</p>
