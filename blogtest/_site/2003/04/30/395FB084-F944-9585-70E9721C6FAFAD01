<p>I try to keep my blog purely focused on tech stuff - so I hope you will forgive this rare rant. I've had nothing but grief with the last HP printer I purchased - from usability gripes to pages that smudge and force me to 'clean' my printer. I've been reading about how HP wants to add chips to their cartridges to prevent third-party ink sellers - and now they have gone even further and added expiration dates to their cartridges.</p>

<p>When my HP printer finally dies, or when I take a bat to it ala Office Space, I will never buy from them again.</p>
