<p>rss.cfm now looks for additional url parameters - basically the same as index.cfm. The feed can now be filtered by category, so if you want, you can syndicate just my ColdFusion content, and nothing else.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>getEntries returns two new cols: categoryIDs and CategoryNames. These are both lists where the Nth ID matches the Nth name.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Index.cfm updated to show categories and pass filtering information to rss.cfm.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm not entirely happy with the code in getEntries. It seems to me that there should be an easier way to do this:</p>
<p>Table A has records. Table B has records. Table C is a table that defines relationships between A and B. I want to select from A and set a value, &quot;B&quot;, which represnts all the records in C where C.A_ID = A.ID. I know it can be done with a stored procedure, but I'm surprised there isn't a way to do this in simple SQL. Something like:</p>
<p>select id, name, categoryNames as (select ....),</p>
}
