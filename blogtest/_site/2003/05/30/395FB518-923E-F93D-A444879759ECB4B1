<p>The latest Mozilla browser has been released. I'm sticking with Firebird now (the slimmer version of Mozilla), but if you are still using IE, or were burned by how horrible Netscape 4 was, you should check out Mozilla. The number one feature? Popup blocking. It also includes the ability to block images from other servers - and handy way to block ads - although I use a hosts file for that.</p>
