<p>Sometimes I really love the Net. I was looking for a tool today that would extract video from a cue/bin file (cd image). After looking for about five minutes, I ran across VCDGear (www.vcdgear.com). This tool does <i>exactly</i> what I need - so in case anyone else has ever needed a tool like this, I decided to blog about it.</p>
