<p>As you may know, Macromedia removed Advanced Security from ColdFusion MX (yea!). In its place is a new system called Roles-Based security. However, advanced security was not completely removed. If you try to write a UDF with the same name as one of the old functions, like isAuthenticated, you will get the following error:</p>
<p>Function isAuthenticated is not supported in ColdFusion MX.</p>
<p>It looks like Macromedia didn't remove the old functions, but instead left special 'hooks' for them to really make it clear that they were removed. This is... well... a bit silly. I've already opened a bug report on this and hopefully it will be fixed in the next release. Another function name you may try to use: isAuthorized. This will be blocked as well.</p>
