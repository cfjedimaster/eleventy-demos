<h1>Post</h1>

<p>Blog 2.1 is now posted. Changes include:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Authenticate method is now in blog CFC where it belongs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>blog.ini file structure has changed. Before, there was a root section called &quot;blog&quot; with one value, name. This allowed you to say, the default blog is 'foo'. Now, we have a root section called default. If you do not specify a name when you call init, these values will be used. If you specify a name and do not specify one of the values, the default will be used. If you try to init(&quot;fred&quot;) and fred isn't an ini file section, you get an error.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><font color="red">Warning - This update changes the ini file structure. Be sure to carefully integrate the new changes.</font></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>Remember Me function added to Add Comments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Logout link added (for when you are logged in, of course).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Coming Soon: Support for N blogs w/ one database.</p>
<p>Question: Should blog support non-db persistence? Ie, should I allow you to store your data in xml files instead of SQL Server?</p>
