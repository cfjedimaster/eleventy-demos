<p>So, I recently needed to stress test some code of mine. I downloaded and used the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/treeview/default.asp?url=/TechNet/itsolutions/intranet/downloads/webstres.asp?frame=true">Microsoft Web Application Stress Tool</a>. This is a great and simple tool to help you see how your web sites work under stress. I had one big problem with it - I couldn't get it to work on different ports. Tom Link  sent me an email this afternoon pointing out that there is a way, but it's very unintiutive. For each script item, there is a gray box to the left hand side. If you <b>double</b>-click the box, you get a set of options for the script item, including the port.</p>
<p>By the way, another nice free stress tool is <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/jmeter/index.html">JMeter</a> from the Apache people.</p>
