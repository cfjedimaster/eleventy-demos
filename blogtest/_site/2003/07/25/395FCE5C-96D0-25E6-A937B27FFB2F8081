<p>For those who aren't up on their adoption lingo, &quot;Gotcha&quot; Day is the day your child arrives home. Three years ago today my son, Jacob Alexandr√© Camden, arrived home from Korea. It was an experience I can't even begin to describe, and it's been a fun, wild, wonderful ride since then. After Jacob is my daughter, Jacqueline, and my third child, Noah, is still in Korea as we wait for the government to prove that a) my wife and I can afford him (they must not realize the true cost of diapers), and b) neither my wife or I, or Noah, are terrorists (yes, my wife and I had our fingerprints sent to Interpol, since, as we know, terrorists like to adopt).</p>
