<p>The 4th DRK was <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/drk/productinfo/product_overview/volume4/">released</a> today. I had a chance to beta the content on here and I can say this is the <i>best</i> release yet. My favorite item is the Pollster application, which will be in use on this blog <i>very</i> soon. Some of the more interesting CF applications are: Log4CF,  Jimg, and the XML Indenter. For the CF content alone, the DRK is well worth the money.</p>
