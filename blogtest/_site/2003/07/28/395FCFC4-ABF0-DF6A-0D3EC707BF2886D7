<p>So, a lot of people have been talking about the new Windows-only Buymusic.com. I decided to check it out. While it's certainly kinda sad that it only supports Windows and IE, I was a bit surprised to see this in the usage rules for a particular track:</p>
<p>&quot;No other uses of Digital Downloads are permitted. End User may only use, copy, transfer and display the Digital Downloads as stated in the particular music song or albumâ€™s Metadata information. All other rights are reserved.&quot;</p>
<p>This particular track allowed for 10 CD burnings.</p>
<p>Now, someone explain this to me. Once I burn it to CD, what is to stop me from turning it back into a 'normal' MP3? In fact, it seems as if even if there isn't a technical reason, there is no legal reason either, since their terms apply to the digital download. It does NOT apply to the CD burned from the digital download. (In fact, wouldn't mind right to make one backup copy automatically overrule them anyway?)</p>
<p>Doesn't this same loophole exist for iTunes, and if so, why in the heck even limit the number of CD burns - or are there really a lot of people who can't figure out how to rip a CD now?</p>
