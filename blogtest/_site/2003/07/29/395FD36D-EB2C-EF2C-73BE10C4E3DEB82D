<p>Saw this post on Slashdot today, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/TECH/ptech/07/29/telemarketers.sue.ap/index.html">&quot;Telemarketers sue over do-not-call list&quot;</a>. Somehow I can't make myself feel sorry for these people. They whine and moan that two million jobs will be lost.</p>
<p>So... let me get this straight. Two million people whose job it is to ruin your dinner - interrupt you at work - bother you, let's face it, with BS offers - may not be able to do so anymore and may have to - lord forbid - get jobs that do not involve torturing the public?</p>
<p>The thing that gets me is that - this isn't a law banning telemarketing - it's just a law allowing people to ask that they do not be called. But the telemarketers <i>still</i> want to call them? I would <i>love</i> to have someone tell me this with a straight face. &quot;Yes sir, even though you signed the do not call list, we felt our offer was too wonderful to pass you by!&quot; Yea, right.</p>
