<p>I finally picked up an XBox today (my other system is a PS2). I purchased Midnight Club II and will be getting KOTOR very soon from a friend. So far I'm impressed. The load times are pretty short and the graphics are snazzy. The controller doesn't feel quite right yet, but I think that's a problem with the game itself, and even more so my familiarity with the PS2 controller.</p>
<p>Later today I take my CFMX Certification test. I took a practice test last night and messed up on a few simple questions regarding when you need to scope variables. I take this as a good sign - I scope <i>every</i> non-local variable.</p>
<p>Next week I will not be blogging much, and will be completely off the net from Tuesday afternoon to Thursday. The 'why' of all this is personal, but I do plan on sharing when I return.</p>
