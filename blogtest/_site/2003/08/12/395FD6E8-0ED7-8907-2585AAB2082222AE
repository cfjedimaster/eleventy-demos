<p>Sorry for the lack of updates. We have a major deadline at work, and I will be completely off the Net from tonight till Friday. Why is still a secret, but I do plan on sharing Friday sometime (maybe even Thursday if I'm awake).</p>
<p>On a totally unrelated note, I finally saw Gangs of New York last night. It was a wonderful film with some of the best sets/shots I've seen ever. It was a bit violent at times though (I must be getting old), and some of the plot was a bit... not sure what the right word is so I'll just say 'off.' Daniel Day-Lewis was the best part of the film... although typically the bad guys are the most interesting.</p>
