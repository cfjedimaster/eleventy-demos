<p>So, to add to the chaos of a new child in the home, we had a little run-in in the parking lot this Saturday. By &quot;run-in&quot; I mean some idiot driver didn't bother to look where she was going and rammed the side of my car. First, let's take a look at my damage:</p>

<p>I drive a Chrysler Town and Country, two years old, nice big 'tank' type vehicle. While things look pretty crumpled, you can't see anything at all on the inside. By the way, above that 'wrinkle' is where my daughter and son sit. No one was hurt. (Although I have more to say about that later.) Now let's look at the idiot's car:</p>

<p>Her car was a brand new 2004 Pontiac Firebird. As you can see, it was pretty banged up. So, what exactly happaned? My wife was driving (those of you who know me well know I really don't like driving that much) and had just pulled into the parking lot of Albertsons. The idiot was at a fast food restaurant and was pulling out of the 'sub' parking lot into the 'main' parking lot. She was supposed to wait for us to pass, but instead rammed the side of us.</p>
<p>What makes this even more fun (smirk) is the story the driver told. First she said we were speeding, although with three kids in the car, <i>and</i> with just completing a turn, there is no way were speeding. She complained of neck pain and her companion said she broke her foot, but neither wanted to call an ambulance. Even better, they both weren't carrying any form of insurance. (The person in the passenger seat was the owner of the car.) The cop pretty much reamed them a new one, but didn't write them a ticket since the accident occured on private property.</p>
<p>I'm certainly happy that no one was hurt - and this may sound petty but with the way the idiot's reacted to everything, I'm glad their car was totalled. They were totally and completely unapologetic and basically said we hit them. (Amazing - how did we hit them since the damange was on our side... did we slide into them?) Now I'm waiting for a call from the local repair shop that my insurance agency hooked me up with.</p>
<p>Question - my insurance company says I have to pay a deductible - does that apply even when the accident is someone else's fault?</p>
