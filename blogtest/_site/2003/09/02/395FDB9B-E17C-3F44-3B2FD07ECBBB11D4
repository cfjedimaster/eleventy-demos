<h1>Post</h1>

<p>The site my <a href="http://www.mindseye.com">company</a> was working on for the past couple of weeks went live over the weekend. <a href="http://www.aspensnowmass.com">Aspensnowmass.com</a> is a client we have had for many years and was a Spectra site up till this past week when it was converted to <a href="http://www.mindseyeelement.com">Element</a>, a CMS we sell. While I've always been a fan of Spectra, I love our CMS, and the speed improvements from the old site are amazing. I hope everyone will forgive what sounds like an obvious marketing entry, but I do like to share what I've been working on. If anyone has any questions about the implementation, especially in regards to converting from Spectra, drop me a line.</p>
