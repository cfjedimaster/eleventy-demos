<p>Folks, don't forget that today is the global MMUG meeting. If you haven't joined your local MMUG (or CFUG) than you are really missing out on a valuable resource. Your local user group is not only a place to learn, it's also a great way to network. Tonight's <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/special/usergroups/index.html?promoid=pu2_homepage_user_mx2004_082403">meeting</a> will have the first public demostrations of Dreamweaver MX 2004, Flash MX 2004, and Fireworks MX 2004. The brand new Flash Professional MX 2004 will also be shown. If you are in the Acadiana area (Southwest Louisiana), please join me. More details can be found <a href="http://www.cflib.org/acadiana">here</a>.</p>
