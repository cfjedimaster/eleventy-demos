<h1>Post</h1>

<p>A while back, I posted on cfcdev (a mailing list about CFC development, see <a href="http://www.cfczone.org">cfzone.org</a> for signup info) about having a BOF meeting at MAX on CFC development. BOF meetings are informal discussion groups held at night during the conference.</p>
<p>For reasons I won't go into here, having a BOF is no longer an option. However, I'd <i>love</i> to have a meeting, face to face, with developers interested in CFC development. While there are CFC sessions at MAX, I'd like to see something more informal and open.</p>
<p>So, if you are interested, please add yourself to the comments list. If we have enough interest, then I'll investigate this and see if we can find a place to meet. By posting a comment, when I respond later on you will automatically be emailed.</p>
