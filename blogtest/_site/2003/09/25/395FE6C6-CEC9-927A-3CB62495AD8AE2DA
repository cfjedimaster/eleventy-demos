<p>Everyone and their brother is blogging it, but Macromedia released a public beta of <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/central/">Central</a> today. It sure looks pretty, but I'm not sure if it will fly. I already use a web browser to get all of my information anyway, so do I want to run another application? At the same time, it's ability to work offline is nice as well, but I'd bet most of the applications will be more tuned for net access. That's the real crux of the issue, perhaps, the applications. I'm curious to see what apps get created and what kind of market there will be for them.</p>
<p>Just for the heck of it I've added a poll to my site to let you rate what you think of Central. I'm in the undecided category right now but I'm curious to see what others think.</p>
