<p>I've been in Memphis this week migrating an application we wrote for a bank from CF5 to MX 6.1. In general, it has gone very nicely. The Code Analyzer was <i>wonderful</i> for pointing out the obvious stuff, and the rest of the issues we ran into were fairly minor... until today. We have a report that we generate on screen, as well as giving you the option to export to a text file. We used cfheader/cfcontent to handle the export, using code like so:</p>
<p>&lt;cfheader name=&quot;Content-Disposition&quot; value=&quot;attachment; filename=foo.txt&quot;&gt;<br>
&lt;cfcontent type=&quot;text/plain&quot; reset=&quot;yes&quot;&gt;</p>
<p>This was working in CF5, but under MX 6.1, we kept getting a blank page (not in the browser, but in the text file that was created). The first thing I did was to remove the cfheader/content to ensure that text really was coming out. It was. I then tried a different browser and that didn't work either. This particular piece of code was buried a bit deep, so I did a copy/paste into a new CFM, and discovered it worked fine!</p>
<p>So, I dug around quite a bit more, and have found what I believe to be a bug in CFMX. The issue involved two things: One, I was using cfsetting enablecfoutputonly=&quot;true&quot; and two, I was using a &quot;wrapper&quot; tag for layout. By &quot;wrapper&quot; I mean code that looks like this, &lt;cf_display&gt; stuff &lt;/cf_display&gt;. If I switched the cfsetting to false, the problem went away. If I kept it at either true or false, but removed the custom tag calls, the problem also went away. It seems as if the user of the wrapper tag confused things.</p>
<p>Anyway, as always I share my headaches to help prevent yours. :) Also, I made sure to log a  bug at <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/go/wish">http://www.macromedia.com/go/wish</a>.</p>
