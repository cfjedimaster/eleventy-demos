<p>I found another great site with Studio extensions. You may have seen my earlier <a href="http://www.camdenfamily.com/morpheus/blog/index.cfm?mode=entry&entry=395FCF85-A519-06AC-1328158BE22F169E">post</a> about extending HS/Studio. It's very easy and can add a lot to your development. This new site, <a href="http://www.wilk4.com/asp4hs/">ASP4HS</a>, is geared towards ASP development in HS, but has many tools CF developers would like as well. One of the coolest is a hook into your diff tool. (In case you don't know, a diff tool simply compares too files. This is very handy for finding out what changed when a file stops working correctly.)</p>
