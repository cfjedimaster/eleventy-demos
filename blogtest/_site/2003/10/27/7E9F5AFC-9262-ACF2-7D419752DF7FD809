<p>So, for the first time today, I purchased a song a song over the net. I'm using iTunes, which I absolutely love, and the process was extremely simple. For those who are curious, I picked up &quot;Crazy in Love&quot; by Beyonce. This is <i>defintely</i> not my normal musical preference (trance/dance/classical/80s), but for some reason that darn song just does something for me - plus my wife likes it as well.</p>
<p>I have to say - the music industry is an absolute idiot for taking this long to embrace the net. I didn't think twice about plopping down 99 cents for a single.</p>
<p>So, not that I want to cheat, but since you can't get a MP3 from your purchase until you burn to a CD than rerip, does anyone know if it's possible to emulate a CD burner and simply create an ISO? Than I could use cd emulation to read and rip the song to MP3.</p>
