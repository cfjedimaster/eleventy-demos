<p>I don't normally point to other blogs, since I assume most people who read this blog probably read the same blogs I do, but I just had to share this <a href="http://mediadiva.net/mt/archives/000298.html">link</a>  over at Brandy Fortune's blog. Apparently Amazon is using a simple CSS trick to prevent people from printing pages from their new &quot;Search within Books&quot; feature. Does Amazon really think this will stop the casual user? How many times must people be told that security through obscurity is not a solution?</p>
<p>In the past, I've made the point that these types of things are better than nothing. However, this is a special case. Amazon has offered up thousands of books to the world, and they are, or should be, thinking about all the copyright owners out there. Do we really need &quot;proof&quot; with a page screen shot? Heck, why even have a screen shot of the whole page? It is obvious that Amazon has a database with all the words AND the screen shots, so why not simply return just the paragraph of the match, or even just a few words surrounding the match? I don't really see a need to return the whole page, and in a fashion that is so easy to rip off.</p>
