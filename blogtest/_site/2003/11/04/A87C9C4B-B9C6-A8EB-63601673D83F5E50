<p>This is just to officially let folks know that the CFC Geeks of a Feather at MAX is officially on. Well, unofficially since I wasn't able to submit an official <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/macromedia/conference/agenda/bof.html">Birds of a Feather</a>.</p>
<p>The meeting time is Wednesday, 6PM-8PM. It will be in the Marriot at 75 S. West Temple. The actual room number isn't known yet. When I know it, I'll post it here, or, you can just ask at the front desk.</p>
<p>This meeting is for CFC developers of all skill levels and is attended mainly to be an informal discussion of CFC development and tips.</p>
