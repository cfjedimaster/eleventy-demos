<p>A new technote, <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/coldfusion/ts/documents/createuuid_clock_speed.htm">ColdFusion MX: CreateUUID Increases the Windows System Clock Speed</a> has been released at Macromedia.com. If you make use of createUUID(), you should take a look at it.</p>
<p>Blog 3.0: The next release (which will either be a RC or a Beta) is almost ready. MS Access support is in. Localization is in. The localized calendar is not. Timezone support is not. Outside of that, it's almost ready. I've added some nice caching to the display of the blog as well.</p>
