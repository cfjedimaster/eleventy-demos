<p>So, I can't help but notice the amount of people <a href="http://www.maxbloggers.com">blogging</a> reviews of MAX sessions. Am I the only speaker who is going to spend all night checking to see how good/bad their reviews were??? (grin)</p>
<p>Of course, I am a bit paranoid, so I'm probably the only one.</p>
