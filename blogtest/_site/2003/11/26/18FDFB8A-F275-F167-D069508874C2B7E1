<p>This came up today on cf-talk, so I thought I'd remind folks. Do not forget that the result of structKeyList is NOT in alphabetical order. It WAS in CF5, but isn't in CFMX. If you need the keys in a sorted order, just use listSort on the result. Also, in general, remeber that you should not assume anything about the order of keys. If order is important, consider using an array of struct instead.</p>
