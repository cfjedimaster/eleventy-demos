<p>While it is a bit late, you should know that November is the National Adoption Awareness Month. Starting in 1990, the idea was to &quot;focus attention on the increasing numbers of children in the child welfare system waiting to be adopted.&quot; (From <a href="http://www.adoptionmonth.com">AdoptionMonth.com</a>)</p>
<p>As the father of three adopted children, I can truly attest to how wonderful the process is. It is certainly <b>not</b> an easy process, but raising children was not meant to be easy.</p>
