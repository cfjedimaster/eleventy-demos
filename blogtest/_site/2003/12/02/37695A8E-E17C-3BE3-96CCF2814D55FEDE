<p>When it comes to copyright, I tend to believe that the copyright owner can be as nice as they want to be. This goes against most folks, but it's how I feel. However, while I believe people can be as nice/mean as they care to, sometimes I just have to shake my head.</p>
<p>My wife picked up a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000DF00Z/qid=1070376356/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_1/103-3254848-0227857">Harry Connick, Jr. Christmas CD</a> this past weekend. (And it's <i>very</i> good by the way.) While looking at the song list, I noticed that two companies refused to give Harry permission to print the lyrics to the song.</p>
<p>Can anyone explain the logic behind this? What is to stop someone from simply taking notes while the song is sung?</p>
<p>Again - I tend to think this is within the copyright owners rights.... but what do they think they are protecting?</p>
