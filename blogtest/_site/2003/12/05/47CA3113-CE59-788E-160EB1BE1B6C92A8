<p>Someone on cf-talk today asked about how to force CF to remember the case of a struct key. If you use dot notation, s.nAme = &quot;ray&quot;, CF will uppercase the key. If you use bracket notation, s[&quot;Name&quot;] = &quot;ray&quot;, CF will remember the case.</p>
<p>However, this is not (afaik) intentional. If case is important to you, simply store the string. For example:</p>
<p>s = structNew();<br>
s.ray = structNew();<br>
s.ray.value = whatever;<br>
s.ray.label = &quot;Ray&quot;;<br></p>
<p>Another possibility is to a use a java HashTable, but that may be a bit too complex for folks not used to Java.</p>
