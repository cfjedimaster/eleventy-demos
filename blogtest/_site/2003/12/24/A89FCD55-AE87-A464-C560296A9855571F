<h1>Post</h1>

<p>The title says it all. This has, obviously, been somewhat of a quiet week for me on the blog. Work has been pretty quiet as well. We have a major milestone due, but my part the last few days has been limited so I've been focusing on learning ASP.Net and C# (more on that next year). I hope everyone has a wonderful Christmas. I can tell already the best part will be when my kids start going crazy around sundown tonight.</p>
