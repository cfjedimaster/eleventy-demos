<p>Today a discussion about partial page caching came up on cf-talk. I mentioned a custom tag I had written about for CFDJ, ScopeCache. I could have sworn I blogged about it before, but since I couldn't find it in my archives, I must have forgotten.</p>
<p>So, with that in mind, I decided to add a few new features to it and upload it. ScopeCache allows you to easily cache partial page content. This is done by simply wrapping content:</p>
<div class="code"><FONT COLOR=MAROON>&lt;cf_scopecache name=<FONT COLOR=BLUE>"stockInfo"</FONT> scope=<FONT COLOR=BLUE>"application"</FONT> timeout=<FONT COLOR=BLUE>"#30*60#"</FONT>&gt;</FONT><br>
do some slow stuff here<br>
<FONT COLOR=MAROON>&lt;/cf_scopecache&gt;</FONT></div>
<p>This code will cache the result of the code inside the call for thirty minutes. The older version didn't even have a timeout. (Don't ask me why, I just never added it.) You can set a timeout to a specific date and time, or by a number of seconds.</p>
<p>Also included are dependancies. This allows you to &quot;chain&quot; caches. So if cache item A has a dependancy of B, it means that when A is cleared, or removed because of a timeout, then B will be cleared as well. This process is chained so that if B had dependancies, they will be cleared as well.</p>
<p>The next feature I'm considering adding is a &quot;size&quot; to the cache. This would allow you to say &quot;Only cache N items&quot;. Removal would be done like .Net's cache system - each item in the cache would have a &quot;weight&quot; and the lightest items would be removed first. (By the way, if you haven't checked it out, the built-in cache system in .Net is <i>very</i> sweet.)</p>
<p>If you have any questions, or suggestions, about this code, just let me know.</p>
