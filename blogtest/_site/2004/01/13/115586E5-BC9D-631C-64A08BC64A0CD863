<h1>Post</h1>

<p>As I mentioned before, the 3.0 version of the blog is pretty much ready to go. The code is in good shape. I'm happy with the features. There is only one thing left to do... documentation. Right now I'm trying like heck to find time to finish it, but real life is getting in the way. That being said, if anyone wants a copy of the code as-is, please email me and I'll give you a drop.</p>
<p>What do I have planned post 3.0? The very first thing I want to add is a new db table for search stats.</p>
