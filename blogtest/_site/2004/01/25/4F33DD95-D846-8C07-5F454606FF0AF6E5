<p>So, my wife and I have the family van (which I like to call the bus), but for a while now we've been talking about getting a second car. Something <i>not</i> for the kids. This weekend we went out and got a Mini Cooper.</p>

<p>This model was almost exactly what we had speced out at mini.com. Sunroof, cruise control, nice Harman Kardon stereo system, and other nice features as well.</p>

<p>It drives like a golf cart on steroids. Even driving to the inlaws is like being in a rally race. The car is just pure <i>fun</i> to drive.</p>
