<p>Last night a milestone was achieved on <a href="http://www.cflib.org">CFLib</a> - our 750th UDF was released. CFLib has been around since right before ColdFusion 5 was released - which makes it about two to three years old I believe. I'm a bit biased but I think the project has been a great success. One of my New Years resolutions was to get the queue in check and I'm slowly going through them all. (We had about 78 UDFs in the queue at the beginning of the year and are now down to 38.)</p>
<p>If anyone has any suggestions for how the site can be improved, please let me know. Also, when you do visit the site, don't forget to visit the sponsors as it helps fund my video game addiction. ;)</p>
