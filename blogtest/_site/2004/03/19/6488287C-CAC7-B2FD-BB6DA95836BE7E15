<p>A friend reported the following bug with HS+</p>
<ol>
<li>Open a largish file in Homesite+ via RDS
<li>Make a change to the file and hit save
<li>Before the first file is finished saving, open a second file via RDS
</ol>
<p>When the above happens, there is a chance that one of the files will overwrite the other. This has been confirmed in HS+ 5.5, HS+ 5.2, and ColdFusion Studio 5.0.</p>
<p>I pinged a contact I have on the HS+ 5.5 team who confirmed the issue and opened a bug report for it.</p>
