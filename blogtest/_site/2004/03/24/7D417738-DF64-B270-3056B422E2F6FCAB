<h1>Post</h1>

<p>So, I ran into an interesting bug yesterday. Consider the following query:</p>
<div class="code"><FONT COLOR=MAROON>&lt;cfquery name=<FONT COLOR=BLUE>"qObjectGet"</FONT><br>
datasource=<FONT COLOR=BLUE>"#attributes.datasource#"</FONT>&gt;</FONT><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SELECT &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FROM &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#attributes.type#<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHERE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;id = <FONT COLOR=MAROON>&lt;cfqueryparam<br>
cfsqltype=<FONT COLOR=BLUE>"CF_SQL_INTEGER"</FONT> value=<FONT COLOR=BLUE>"#attributes.id#"</FONT> list=<FONT COLOR=BLUE>"No"</FONT> null=<FONT COLOR=BLUE>"No"</FONT>&gt;</FONT><br>
<FONT COLOR=MAROON>&lt;/cfquery&gt;</FONT></div>
<p>This was running fine, but all of a sudden began throwing the following error:</p>
<p>[Macromedia][SQLServer JDBC Driver]Value can not be converted to requested type.</p>
<p>I did a quick google search, but couldn't find anything clearly related - except for one post that suggested simply modifying the query by adding a semicolon. I did and the error went away.</p>
<p>It turns out that this error would return everytime I modified the table. I either had to modify the query or restart CF.</p>
<p>Apparently there is some caching involved of the table schema when using queryparam, and the change to the table schema confused CF.</p>
<p>However, it is <i>not</i> reproduceable. I tried to reproduce it again this morning and was not able to. My coworkers at <a href="http://www.mindseye.com">Mindseye</a> have also seen this and have not been able to reproduce it at will.</p>
<p>So - something to watch out for!</p>
