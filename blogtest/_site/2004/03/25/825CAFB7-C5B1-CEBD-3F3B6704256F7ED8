<p>This was blogged elsewhere but I just had to share. As we all know, CDs can contain both music and data. What I didn't realize is that vinyl records (you rememer those, don't you?) could also contain a data track. This is discussed in detail <a href="http://www.kempa.com/blog/archives/000053.html">here</a>. Simply amazing. I think my favorite example is the game the Thompson Twins put out on vinyl.</p>
