<p>The subject says it all - the 7th <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/drk/productinfo/product_overview/volume7/">DRK</a> has been released. Of particular interest to CF folks is the very cool SEA (Session Expiration Alarm). This is a nice little tool to allow you to handle session expiration. (Although I still hope and pray that Blackstone has <i>real</i> events, I mean, come on now, every since CF has had application and session support it has seemed a bit silly that we couldn't simply say, &quot;Do X&quot; when the session/app started/ended.)</p>
