<p>Ok, so everyone is carrying this, but as a true Star Wars geek I have to repeat it. According to <a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2-2004223126,,00.html">The Sun</a>, the next Star Wars movie will be titled, Birth of the Empire. A pretty good title if I say so my self. The release date for the film is May 19, 2005. (2005 - whenever I see dates like this I'm remdinded of all the sci-fi flicks I saw as a child that took place in 99, 2001, etc.)</p>
