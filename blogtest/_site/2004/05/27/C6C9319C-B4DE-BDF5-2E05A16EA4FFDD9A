<p>I don't normally post political entries here, but I had to share this link to an article over at Congress.org: <a href="http://www.congress.org/congressorg/issues/alert/?alertid=5834001&content_dir=ua_congressorg">Pending Draft Legislation Targeted for Spring 2005</a>. Very interesting reading. While I think the draft is a horrible idea (if you can't convince people to fight for you - what's the point of forcing them to), at least they are making it a bit more fair by including women this time. I'm really surprised this hasn't gotten more press lately.</p>
