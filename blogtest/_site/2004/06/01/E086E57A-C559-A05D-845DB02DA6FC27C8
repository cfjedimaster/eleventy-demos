<p>Well, I finally finished <a href="http://www.bioware.com/games/knights_old_republic/">Knights of the Old Republic</a> this weekend. (With three kids, it takes a <i>long</i> time for me to finish games.) All I can say is.... wow. This is the second Bioware game I've played (the first being <a href="http://nwn.bioware.com/">Neverwinter Nights</a>) and once again I am incredibly impressed. KOTOR had a great engine (which was pretty simular to NWN) and a great story, something you don't always see in Star Wars games. If you haven't picked up these games I'd highly recommend them. I'm defintely looking forward to Jade Empire and Dragon Age.</p>
<p>p.s. For those who have played KOTOR and are curious, I played Dark Side. Really, really dark side. Being good is just too boring. ;)</p>
