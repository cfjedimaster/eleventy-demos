<p>Here is a question - why don't browsers have a mute option? Sure, I could disable Flash, but what I really want is for Flash apps to just shut the heck up. Nothing is more annoying than when a Flash file (or any multimedia extension) starts blaring techno music while iTunes itsels is blarinf techno music.</p>
<p>There should be an option to simply not allow any audio to leave the browser and it should not intefere with the plugin itself.</p>
<p>Anyone know of a Firefox extension like this?</p>
