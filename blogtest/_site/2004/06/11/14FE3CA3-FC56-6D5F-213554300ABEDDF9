<p>So, I'm about to ready to take a hammer to my HP OfficeJet 600. For all of the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>After printing 2 or 3 times, you start getting smudges. Not horrible smudges, but you NEVER get a perfect print out. The official docs at HP has like a 10 step process involving water and coffee filters.</li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, coffee filters.</p>
<p>I've never heard of a printer needing coffee filters to clean itself.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>My color catridge was low on ink. On startup, the printer DEMANDS that you insert a new cartridge. You can't say no. You can't say don't worry about it. You can't say, &quot;Hey, all I plan on doing is a bunch of simple text pages with no pictures, it's ok that it's not in color.&quot; No, you have to physically remove the cartridge and place it back in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And then trick #2 stops working. Now I can't print. Period. Even though I have plenty of black ink, I can't print.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So... can someone recommend a good fax capable printer?</p>
