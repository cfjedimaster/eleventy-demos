<p>So - open question - what software program (either a &quot;real&quot; app or a web app) do you use to manage projects? I'm looking for something that I can simply setup a group of projects in - enter random notes about said projects - maybe set a status - maybe show a list of folks assigned to projects - etc. I don't need anything too complex per se. Right now I'm playing with OneNote, which seems pretty cool, and open ended enough for my needs, but my worry is that it will be useless once I hit the road. (Unless I copy my data files to the laptop and then copy them back.)</p>
<p>I could, of course, build a nice Flex app to handle this, but I have an immidiate need for this as my handwritten notes are getting harder to read. ;)</p>
