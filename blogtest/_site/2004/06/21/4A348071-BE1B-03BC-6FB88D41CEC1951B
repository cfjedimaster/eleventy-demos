<p>So, I got a promotion. Probably not a big deal to most folks, but this is the first time I've been promoted to something more than a simple coder. I'm now the <a href="http://www.mindseye.com/news/announcements.cfm?announcementid=45">Director of Development</a> for Mindseye. This basically means I head up the development team, helping direct our efforts and acting an interface between the rest of the company and the developers. Best of all, I still spend a significant amount of time doing actual dev work.</p>
<p>So - the only drawback to all of this is that it means my family and I will be leaving sunny Louisiana for sub-zero Boston. I love the city of Boston, but I think the weather is going to kill me.</p>
