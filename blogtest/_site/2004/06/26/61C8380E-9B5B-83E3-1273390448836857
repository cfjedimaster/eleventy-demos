<p>So, my CFUN presentation didn't go off nearly as well as I would have liked. There were issues with the projector (not my laptop, I swear ;) that made me miss a good 10 minutes of presentation time. Maybe I'm being a bit too sensitive, but to those who attended, I apologize. I hope you enjoyed what I had time to present.</p>
<p>For those who attended and want a copy of the presentation, you can download it right
<a href="http://www.camdenfamily.com/morpheus/downloads/cfun04.zip">here</a>. This zip includes the Powerpoint along with all the code, except for the CFLIb code I showed off.</p>
<p>So far, CFUN is as great as it always was. This is one of the best conferences out there. If you did not attend, I highly recommend you attend next year.</p>
