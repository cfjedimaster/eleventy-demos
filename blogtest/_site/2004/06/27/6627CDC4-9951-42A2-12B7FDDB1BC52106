<p>Some random points...</p>
<p>Never stay at the Ramada. My experience with it was horrible, made even worse that I've been here four days. This morning when I went to complain, the person in front of me was also complaining, which isn't a good sign. So, just a warning in case they hold the conference in the same place next year.</p>
<p>This conference needs to be expanded. There are some great presentation/topics here and if it were expanded to three or even four days I think it would work great.</p>
