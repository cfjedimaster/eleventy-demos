<p>I'm currently planning a 3.5 release. Some of the new features will include things folks have been asking about for a while now, including multiple blogs per DSN and multiple authors per blog.</p>
<p>I wanted folks opinion on another feature. Some folks do not like the UUIDs I use for PKs for blog entries. It occured to me that it would be trivial to add an &quot;alias&quot; column for blog entries. So, when you create a blog entry, you could add an alias, like &quot;cfunnotes&quot;. I would then allow index.cfm, the main client, to look for url.alias and if it exists, try to load the blog entry defined by that alias.</p>
<p>However, you would be responsible for setting up your own rewrite rules, using Apache conf settings or ISAPI_REWRITE. That would make the most sense I think since those products do url rewriting much easier. Basically, you, as the blog author, would need to make some pattern, yourblog.com/entries/ALIAS, that would rewrite to yourblog.com/index.cfm?alias=ALIAS. The blog would then take over.</p>
<p>Does this sound good even though it requires a bit of custom work on your part? (Although it would only be one time, and heck, you may even be happy with the shorter index.cfm?alias=ALIAS all by itself.)</p>
