<p>We've launched two new  <a href="http://www.mindseyeelement.com">Element</a> sites. <a href="http://www.vantagepartners.com">Vantage Partners</a> &quot;provides companies with the processes, tools, skill-building and technology necessary to build world-class negotiation and relationship management capabilities.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.irobot.com">iRobot</a>, the vacuum, not the movie, also launched. This implementation uses MySQL for the backend and has a very nice Flash front end.</p>
<p><b>Edited</b> I must be getting old. I blogged about iRobot 4 days ago. Sorry about that.</p>
