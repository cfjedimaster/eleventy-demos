<p>Almost everyone is reporting this, but just in case you missed it, the title of Star Wars episode three will be <a href="http://www.starwars.com/episode-iii/bts/production/news20040724.html">Revenge of the Sith</a>. Pretty cool title, I think. I know a lot of true fans didn't care for the prequels, but I've been pretty happy with them. I think as long as you don't take them too seriously (it's camp, not art) then you can really enjoy them.</p>
