<p>So, I read about this free IPod offer at a <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/mac/0,2125,64614,00.html">Wired article</a>. It looks like a scam. It smells like a pyramid scheme, but apparently it is the real deal.</p>
<p>So in a blatant, greedy, ploy to get an IPod (and bear in mind I already have a 60 gig Nomad), I'd like to offer up this referer URL:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.freeiPods.com/default.aspx?referer=8103758">http://www.freeiPods.com/default.aspx?referer=8103758</a></p>
<p>You can sign up for the AOL trial without spending a dime (and then just cancel later). I'm actually going to check it out to see if it is worthwhile for others. (I haven't seen AOL in <i>years</i>.)</p>
<p><b>Edited:</b> I've got 4, one to go!</p>
