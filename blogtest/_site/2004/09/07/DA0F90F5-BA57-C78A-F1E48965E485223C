<p>On Monday we launched another <a href="http://www.mindseyeelement.com">Element site</a>, <a href="http://www.aspensnowmass.com">Aspensnowmass.com</a>. This isn't a new site, but a new version of the old site. Probably the biggest change is the homepage which is now entirely Flash based. (Which, by the way, I had nothing to do with, just in case your wondering if I suddenly grew design skills.)</p>
