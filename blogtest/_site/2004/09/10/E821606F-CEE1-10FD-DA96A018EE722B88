<p>If you are on the Blackstone beta and find that you cannot run Blog CFC, there is a real simple modification you can do in order to get the code run. Simply open the blog.cfc file and remove these lines:</p>
<div class="code"><FONT COLOR=GRAY><I>&lt;!--- Require RedSky ---&gt;</I></FONT><br>
<FONT COLOR=MAROON>&lt;cfif find(<FONT COLOR=BLUE>"6,<FONT COLOR=BLUE>1</FONT>"</FONT>, server.coldfusion.productversion) is not 1&gt;</FONT><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT COLOR=MAROON>&lt;cfset throw(<FONT COLOR=BLUE>"Blog must be run under ColdFusion 6.1."</FONT>)&gt;</FONT><br>
<FONT COLOR=MAROON>&lt;/cfif&gt;</FONT></div>
<p>As you can tell, I made a classic mistake. I checked for CFMX 6.1, and not CFMX 6.1 and higher. I'll correct this later. I also believe that a future release of BlueDragon will support cflogin, and once that happens I'll modify the code to check for that as well.</p>
