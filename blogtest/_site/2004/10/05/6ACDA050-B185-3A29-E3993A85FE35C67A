<p>So, when you post a comment to a thread, an email is sent to everyone in the thread. It was pointed out that some folks may not like that. You can now specify in the blog.ini file if a specific email address should override the FROM on emails sent out for thread comments. If this value is blank, the FROM address of the poster will be used.</p>

<p>Someone, anyone, please help me find a better design for this blog. It is really showing it's age, and as more and more people use my Blog, I'd like to have a new color scheme (or at least a new header).</p>
