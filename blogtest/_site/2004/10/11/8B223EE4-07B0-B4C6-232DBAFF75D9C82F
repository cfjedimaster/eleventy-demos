<h1>Post</h1>

<p>Just a reminder. My <a href="http://www.camdenfamily.com/morpheus/blog/index.cfm?mode=entry&entry=6E071A56-C3C8-DA85-1B47B3383783CE29">simple little post</a> a few days ago generated a lot of heat in the comments section. One user complained that when they posted, they started getting emails from the blog whenever someone posted a comment. This is a feature of the blog. I figure if you post to a comment, you want to hear what others have to say.</p>
<p>Right now there is no way around this. However, it is probably a nice feature to add in the next version so I'll be adding this in 3.5.2.</p>
<p>Also, thanks to those who wrote offering help with a new design. I actually did get a new design (from someone whose name is not in front of me), but after a weekend from Hell (don't ask, just glad it's over), I haven't had a chance to implement it yet.</p>
