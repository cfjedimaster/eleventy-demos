<p>A <a href="/morpheus//forums">Galleon Forums</a> user alerted me to an issue today that I thought I'd share with folks. He noticed that everytime he would try to post a new thread, he would get an error. Everything else seemed to work ok, but anything involving a form, in this case posting a new thread or trying to use the admin, would fail.</p>
<p>Turns out, he was using IIS Basic Authentication on the web server. Galleon makes use of CFLOGON to handle security. It doesn't <i>force</i> you to logon. Instead, it lets you browse the site, and when you want to write a message, you need to register or logon. In order to handle this logic, I wrote a simple UDF:</p>
<div class="code">function isLoggedIn() {<br>
  return getAuthUser() neq <FONT COLOR=BLUE>""</FONT>;<br>
}</div>
<p>The idea was that - when you logged in, getAuthUser would equal your username. Anyone logged in to the system would have the rights to post content.</p>
<p>However, the CFLOGIN system also integrates with your web server security. What happaned was that getAuthUser was <b>not</b> blank, but equaled the username used by IIS when he was first prompted to login.</p>
<p>So, Galleon thought he was logged in. It provided him with a button to enter a new thread. However, the CFC used ROLEs restrictions, and would not let him post.</p>
<p>Just so it is clear, this is not a bug. This stems from the fact that my application was saying he was logged in when he was not. I believe if I simply tweak my UDF, I won't have the problem anymore, although I'm curious as to what getAuthUser will return since there will be both an IIS-level user and a Galleon level user.</p>
<p>I will probably simply set a session variable, and then have my UDF check for that. Now I know that flies in the face of things I've said (and others) about directly accessing &quot;external&quot; scopes in UDFs. However, this is a perfect example (imho) of where the rules were mean't to be broken.</p>
<p>At the same time, it would be nice if MACR would add a isAuthenticated() function!</p>
