<h1>Post</h1>

<p>This release updates the Commenting feature to allow you to subscribe (or not) to a thread. My &quot;auto-signup&quot; tended to <a href="http://weblog.burningbird.net/archives/2004/10/11/another-clever/">piss</a> a few people off, so I figured it was time to get off my butt and get it coded.</p>
<p>The way subscriptions work now is - when you post a comment, you are asked if you want to subscribe. This  defaults to false. If you click the checkbox, you will get any further posts to the thread.</p>
<p>The code is anal in assuming you don't want emails. If you post once, and say you want to subscribe, then post again, and don't click the checkbox, it will ensure that you do not get email from further posts. In other words, it updates your earlier subscription and sets it to false.</p>
<p>I tested this... although not as great as I should have. If you find any issues, let me know.</p>
<p><b>Edited:</b> The db scripts do NOT contain the code to auto add the admin/admin user. I will add that later.</p>
