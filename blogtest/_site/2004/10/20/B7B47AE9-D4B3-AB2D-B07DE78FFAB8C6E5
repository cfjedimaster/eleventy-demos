<p>A friend reported something odd when they migrated from CF5 to CFMX w/latest updater installed. The application is dramatically slower on MX than on CF5. Nothing seems wrong on the box itself, but the machine hosting the SQL Server database shows unusually high CPU cycles. (mid-to-high 80% - MX - 20-30% in CF5.) This same setup runs fine when using CF5. Anyone seen this before?</p>
