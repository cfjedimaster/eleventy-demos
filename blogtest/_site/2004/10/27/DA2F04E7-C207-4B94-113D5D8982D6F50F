<p>If you have any questions, requests, or bug reports for Soundings, please report it at the <a href="http://www.camdenfamily.com/morpheus/forums/forums.cfm?conferenceid=5">conference</a> I just set up for it. Thanks.</p>
<p>Also - there will be a new question type released sometime soon. I didn't get a chance to finish it in time for release, but support for Matrix style questions will be what I work on next. &quot;Matrix&quot; questions are the ones where you have a range of values (like from Least Likely to Most Likely) across the top and a range of items down the side.</p>
