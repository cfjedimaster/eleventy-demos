<p>So I'm sure everyone read the Slashdot <a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/yro/04/10/27/1932201.shtml?tid=153">story</a> about how Nintendo threatened to sue someone for just saying they liked a game. Well, Nintendo realized they made a mistake and has <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2004/10/28/nintendo_apologizes_.html">apologized</a>. I wanted to pass this along because <i>everyone</i> hears about it when a company screws up, but they rarely hear about it when the company tries to correct the wrong. So, kudos to Nintendo. (Although your Gamecube still sucks. ;)</p>
