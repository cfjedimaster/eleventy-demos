<p><b>Wednesday's Keynote</b> Well... the keynote was... long. I guess that's what I can say. I have to say I missed the &quot;Morning Show&quot; routine MACR did the last few years. This keynote just didn't really do much for me. Although it was nice to see Captivate and what it could do. I was a bit surprised Dreamweaver didn't get any real time over the keynotes. Anyway, they could have trimmed some of the design stuff from both days and made the demos a bit slimmer. Then again, I'm a code geek so design stuff has minimal interest. (Although again, the Flash 8 stuff was amazing.)</p>
<p><b>Hal Helm's OO CF Class:</b> I don't remember the exact name of his class, but it was one of the best sessions I've seen at a conference yet.</p>
