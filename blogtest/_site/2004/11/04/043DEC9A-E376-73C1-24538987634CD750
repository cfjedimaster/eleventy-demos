<h1>Post</h1>

<p>I'm sitting in a session on CSS and so far I'm really enjoying it. I've used CSS quite a bit, but never really took the time to &quot;formally&quot; learn CSS. The presenter is doing a great job pointing out the little details that sometimes throws me for a loop.</p>
<p>Once again I'm impressed by the CSS support in Dreamweaver. Of course, not enough to actually <i>use</i> on a daily basis, but I'll certainly use it next time I'm designing a style sheet.</p>
