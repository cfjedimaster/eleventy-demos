<p>So, another year, another MAX. Here are some random notes in no particular order.</p>
<p>For those who attended my presentation, I'll put up a zip a bit later. As I said, if you had <b>any</b> follow up questions that you were unable to ask, please feel free to email me. Also, feel free to critique my presentation. I always strive to give the best presentation I can so any comments are welcome.</p>
<p>Keynotes... well I kinda commented on this before, but I really wish they had trimmed them. There was a good 40 minutes in each keynote that could have been taken out. Of course, maybe it's just that I was hungry. ;)</p>
<p>So, in the survey, they mentioned a west coast city for the next MAX. Personally I'll believe it when I see it. I'd love to go west for MAX at least once.</p>
