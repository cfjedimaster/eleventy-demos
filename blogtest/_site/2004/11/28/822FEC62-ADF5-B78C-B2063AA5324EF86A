<p>I've been a user of Yahoo's My Yahoo sercvice for many years now. In fact, I remember the day it came out, and I believe I signed up that very day. It is a nice, simple, easy to use portal system and has been my home page for what seems like forever.</p>
<p>In the years that I have used &quot;morpheus&quot; as a nick for both My Yahoo and Yahoo IM, I've had to deal with various attempts to &quot;hack&quot; my account.</p>
<p>For example - in the beginning, a person could request a new password for a My Yahoo account. They could do this upteen times. This would cause a bunch of emails showing up with a random password in each. I would then go through each one figuring out which was the &quot;last&quot; new password and when finally in, I'd reset to my old password.</p>
<p>About three months ago, someone reset the password again, but this time the new password didn't work. I filled out the support form over at Yahoo and was asked to fill out a form and fax it to Yahoo along with a copy of my driver's license. The form asked various questions about my account, all of which I had no problem answering. A few days later, my account was restored.</p>
<p>About four weeks ago, the same thing happaned, and I went through the exact same process. When I didn't hear anything back after a few days, I filled out the help request again. When I got the exact same request for a fax, I responded saying that I had already faxed. Then I heard nothing. So I tried the form again. I explained the situation, and made it clear that if my application was being processed, I didn't mind waiting. Still... nothing. So I tried it again. And again.</p>
<p>This evening, a friend told me he got an IM from morpheus asking him to remove himself since the account had a new owner. I guess Yahoo simply decided to ignore my requests. It would have been nice if they actually told me something. Maybe I'm being silly - getting attached to a nick. The only thing really &quot;private&quot; up on the account was a bunch of pictures of my kids. Still though, it just ticks me off that someone could abuse the system like that.</p>
<p>So, if any of you have 'morpheus' as your IM contact info for me, please update it to 'cfjedimaster.' If you want, give 'morpheus' a hard time. I don't have proof that the new owner is the same person who ruined my account, but I'd be surprised if it wasn't.</p>
