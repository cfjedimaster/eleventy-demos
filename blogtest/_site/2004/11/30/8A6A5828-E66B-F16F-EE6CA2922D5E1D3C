<p>So, those of who read my blog know that I'm absolutely in love with my Cox DVR system. For those of you whose the system, I thought the following tip would be helpful.</p>
<p>So, the Cox DVR has a &quot;feature&quot; where if you use Fast Forward, then hit Play, it &quot;helps&quot; you by backing up about 30 seconds. I suppose this is useful for folks who are a bit slow, but for the rest of us, this is a real PITA. Especially if you quickly hit FF and Play again, you may end up even further back.</p>
<p>However, I found that if you hit FF and use Pause to stop after the commercials, and <i>then</i> hit Play, it works fine.</p>
