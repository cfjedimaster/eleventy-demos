<h1>Post</h1>

<p>I followed an interesting link on Slashdot to <a href="http://www.robinsloan.com/epic/">Epic 2014</a>, a hypothetical look into the future of media. The content is pretty interesting. What is more interesting is the stunning lack of the obvious.</p>
<p>What do I mean? The video is eight minutes long. There are no controls. No pausing. No rewinding. For a video of such length, not being able to pause it, or jump to a section, is just plain silly.</p>
<p>I see this far too often with presentations online, and it really surprises me that people don't remember to include such controls when creating their content. Perhaps I'm being a bit bitter since something needed my attention... right at the <b>end</b> of the video so I missed it. Am I going to sit through all eight minutes again? Probably, but the point is I shouldn't have to.</p>
