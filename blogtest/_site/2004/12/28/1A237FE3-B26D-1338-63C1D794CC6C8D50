<p>So, just so I'm clear - in my last <a href="http://www.camdenfamily.com/morpheus/blog/index.cfm?mode=entry&entry=19B03FFB-D745-2FFC-3E29FED6BF7816EC">entry</a>, I demonstrated using lCase on a variable before passing it to isSimpleValue. This &quot;fixed&quot; the issue with the string containing XML. However, this code will throw an error if the variable contains an array or any other non-simple value. That defeats the whole purpose of using isSimpleValue.</p>
<p>You could wrap the call in a try/catch code block, but that turns a simple check into a multi-line workaround.</p>
<p>Another note - I noticed that when you pass the value to a function where the argument type is &quot;string&quot;, it works just fine.</p>
