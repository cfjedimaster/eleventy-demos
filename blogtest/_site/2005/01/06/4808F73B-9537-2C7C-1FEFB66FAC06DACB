<p>As you know, <a href="http://www.cflib.org">CFLib</a> is a collection of open source UDFs for ColdFusion. The site has been around since ColdFusion 5, which I think makes it close to three years old now.</p>
<p>I'd like to thank everyone who has supported it over the years, especially those of you who purchased Macromedia products via the links there (just got a nice check a few days ago) and who clicked on the Google ads. Thank you for your support.</p>
<p>In 2005, I have some big things planned (including clearing the queue, yeah, I said that last year). What I would like to know is - what do you think CFLib could do better? What should we add? Is there anything I should remove?</p>
