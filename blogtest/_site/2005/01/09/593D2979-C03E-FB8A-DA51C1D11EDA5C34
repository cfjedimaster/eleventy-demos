<p><a href="http://www.rsswatcher.com">RSSWatcher.com</a> has been updated. It now supports multiple types of RSS feeds, including Atom 0.3. You can also monitor blogs now by using * as a search string. This lets you subscribe to a blog, which is nice for blog feeds that don't actually allow for subscriptions.</p>
