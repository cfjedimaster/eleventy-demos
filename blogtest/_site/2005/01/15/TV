<p>I forgot to post this yesterday, but the new <a href="http://www.scifi.com/battlestar">Battlestar Galactica</a> series is starting on the SciFi channel. Every Friday at 9 central. A... um... friend of mine has been watching this via Bittorrent (the series has aired already in the UK) and he said it was a -great- series. The only complaint is that it seems to have a lot of sex. Outside of that, this is one of best SciFi series I... err my friend has seen in a long time. Definitely worth your time.</p>
