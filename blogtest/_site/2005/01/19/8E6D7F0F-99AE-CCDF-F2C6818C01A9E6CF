<p>So - a few users had reported that whenever they went to camdenfamily.com or cflib.org, they got redirected to the (host)/horde/index.php. I never saw this, so I thought it was nothing. I'm in Boston tonight, and when I tried to access cflib via the hotel's wi-fi, I got the same issue. Than five minutes later it went away. I have a support ticket open with CFXHosting (and they are normally very good about responding).</p>
<p>Of course, if you can read this, you probably won't have the issue. But maybe someone out there has an idea as to what is going on.</p>
