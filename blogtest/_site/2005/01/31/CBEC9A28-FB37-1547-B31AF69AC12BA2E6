<p>Galleon 1.1 has been <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/downloads/forums.zip">released</a>. It is now 100% free and open. Support for MySQL and MS Access has been added (it has always supported SQL Server). Also new is a simple search report tool.</p>
<p>If you enjoy it, as always, I ask that you donate to my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/registry/2TCL1D08EZEYE">Amazon  wishlist</a>, as this software follows the same license as my other apps. (I call it the &quot;Buy Ray crap&quot; license. I'm going to have two kids in private school next fall - so no more budget for games!)</p>
