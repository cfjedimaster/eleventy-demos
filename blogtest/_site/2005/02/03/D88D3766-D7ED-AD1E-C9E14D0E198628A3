<h1>Post</h1>

<p>So I've refrained from joining the &quot;I've got invites&quot; crowd, but now that Google has dropped 50 invites in my account I feel guilty... like maybe I'm not doing enough to help spread the GMail gospel. Does GMail know the kind of pressure they are putting on me?!?! Anyway, post a comment here with your email addy if you want an invite.</p>
<p>Come on. You know you want it. Everyone else is doing Gmail. Shouldn't you?</p>
<p>Signed, rcamden of Gmail. Resistence is futile.</p>
