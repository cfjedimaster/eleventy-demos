<p>Ok, so when I released Galleon, I mentioned my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/registry/2TCL1D08EZEYE">Amazon wish list</a>. That day, someone picked up a gift for me. However, and this may be due to the fact that the gift came from TechDepot, there was no message with the gift.</p>
<p>So - whomever sent me the gift - thank you!</p>
<p>And for those who are curious - it was the Platinum Edition of Neverwinter Nights. I've had the basic edition for a while, and it is (easily) one of the best RPGs ever created.</p>
