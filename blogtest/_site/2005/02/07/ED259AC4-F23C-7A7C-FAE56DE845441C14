<p>So, I've been <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm?mode=entry&entry=395FBCB9-F3AB-A50B-869CBC0830FEABAE">complaining</a> for a while now that CFMX prevented you from using UDF names with the same names as the old Advanced Security functions. MACR didn't just remove the old functions, they prevented you from creating a UDF with the same name. This meant you couldn't have a UDF named isAuthenticated. It's funny how appropriate that name seems when you can't use it (grin).</p>
<p>Well, CFMX 7 removes this silly hook. Of course, this may confuse the 2 or 3 people still using Adv. Sec. in CF5.</p>
