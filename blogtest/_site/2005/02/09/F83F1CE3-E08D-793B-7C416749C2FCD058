<p>So I'm really digging <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar/sunbird.html">Sunbird</a> as a calendar application. One of the neatest things it does is let you subscribe to a remote calendar feed. However, the feed is only in the iCal standard. Not that that is bad per se - but I don't know of any good websites that support it. Yahoo has a calendar service - but it has no syndication features at all. What I want is the ability to enter my events online, and then have access to them via Sunbird on any machine I use. Anyone know of a good (and free) calendar service that will output to iCal. If it had RSS output as well that would rock.</p>
<p>I'm actually contemplating on building my own. It wouldn't be that hard since I'd completely ignore the UI. I'd just have iCal and RSS output feeds.</p>
