<p>Peter F blogs about <a href="http://www.petefreitag.com/item/224.cfm">isValid</a> in CFMX7. This is a very nice feature. I used to do try/catch around cfparam in the past so I'm happy to have this.</p>
<p>One note - the docs say that the regex allowed is JavaScript regex. This is not true. CFML Regex is what is allowed. I'll ping LiveDocs in a moment.</p>
