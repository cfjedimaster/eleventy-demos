<p>The docs contain a nice reference to the new Application.CFC feature. One thing I think is missing is a simple diagram of the methods and what they expect and return. That information <i>is</i> in the docs, but what I want is a nice one page simple Application.cfc I can cut and paste. I also tend to forget what methods return what values, so such a reference would be handy.</p>
<p>So - I wrote up a simple CFC. I read the file in and then passed it to cfdocument, and voila - my <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/downloads/app.pdf">Application.CFC</a> reference was done. I'll be adding it to &quot;My Tools&quot; in a few moments.</p>
