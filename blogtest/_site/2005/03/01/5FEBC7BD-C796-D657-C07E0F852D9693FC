<p>CNN is reporting that <a href="http://www.newsisfree.com/iclick/i,74292351,2315,f/">Senator Ted Stevens</a> will be pushing to apply &quot;decency standards&quot; to cable. So, those of us who go out of our way to pay for cable somehow still need th government to watch out for us. Give me a break. Who out there is asking for the government to regulate cable broadcasts?</p>
<p>As a parent - I didn't like what happaned at last year's superbowl - but guess what - I don't stay up at night worrying about it. I understand how to use the ratings every TV show has to monitor what my kids watch. If HBO plays an R rated show at noon, I'm not going to let my child watch it. Let's be frank. If a parent can't handle that, they are an idiot. Obviously you can't watch your kids all the time - but if you can't trust your kids, take the TV out of their room. Or out of the house.</p>
