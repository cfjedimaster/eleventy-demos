<h1>Post</h1>

<p>So, I'm going to go off the deep end here, but I've got to know. What in the heck is wrong with people? By &quot;you people&quot;, I mean my fellow web developers. On a listserv I belong to, one of the members likes to point out new ColdFusion sites she finds. Whenever I  go to one of these sites, one of the first things I try to do is break the site. Not that I want to harm the site per se - but I'm curious to see how well built the site is.</p>
<p><b>In almost every single case - the site will be broken in less then a minute.</b></p>
<p>This is typically done by simply changing a URL variable. So for example, I may see this:</p>
<p>view.cfm?id=3</p>
<p>The first thing I do is change &quot;id&quot; to &quot;foo&quot;. If that doesn't break the site, I try changing 3 to apple. Or -3. Or 9999999999999. One of these little tricks will typically cause the site to throw an error.</p>
<p>This demonstrates more than one problem. First - why aren't developers using the built in ColdFusion error handling? It takes all of one second to add a cferror tag and a simple error page. You can have the page send you an email describing the error, and display a nice message to the user. Or shoot, have it do nothing. That's better than showing a naked error to the user. Even worst, many sites turn on the &quot;Show Full Path&quot; setting which will show the full path of the file that threw the error. This is a minor security risk that also takes two seconds to fix.</p>
<p>Secondly - why is there no validation on the URL parameter? You need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check that the variable exists
<li>If it is numeric, ensure it is numeric
<li>If it is a PK for a database table, it should be greater than zero
<li>If the row doesn't exist (like when I changed the ID from 3 to 99999999999), handle it
</ul>
<p>All of the above can be done in a few lines of code. All of the above <b>should</b> be done <b>every single time you type URL, Form, or Cookie</b>. All of these variables can be modified by a sneaky user. It may not even be a sneaker user. Someone may email a link, and the email program may break the link at the ?.</p>
<p>The simple point is - if you are working with variables that the user can modify, you need to be extra careful and validate the heck out of it. This is - as far as I know - low level web development stuff. Yet no one seems to be doing it! Well - maybe I'm being a bit over the top (this is a rant after all) - but certainly <i>not enough</i> of my fellow web developers are doing it.</p>
<p>Last but not least - let me be clear. I am <b>far</b> from perfect. I'm sure someone will find a URL validation bug in one my sites. I welcome it. I know I at least try to cover these cases, so if someone does find such a problem with one of my sites, I want to know about it. Also, please don't think this is a ColdFusion problem. It applies to all dynamic web sites.</p>
