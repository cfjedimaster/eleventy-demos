<p>So my new toy came in today...</p>

<p>This is the new 24 inch flat screen from Dell. I have to say - this thing is beautiful. It is a pleasure to look at. Compare it to my old 18 inch flatscreen:</p>

<p>My old flat screen looks dusty and dim in comparison. The Dell also has a card reader (supports all the major types) and some USB ports.</p>
<p>The only issues I had was in setup. At first I couldn't get DVI to work with the screen, then I had issues with the layout of screens, but after playing with it enough I think I have it perfect now.</p>
