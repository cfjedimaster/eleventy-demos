<p>My latest CFDJ article, <a href="http://www.sys-con.com/story/?storyid=48660&DE=1">What Are You Searching For</a>, has been released. It deals with some of the super-cool-awesome (ok, I'm a geek) features of Verity in CFMX7. This is also the topic of one of my presentations at CFUnited this year.</p>
