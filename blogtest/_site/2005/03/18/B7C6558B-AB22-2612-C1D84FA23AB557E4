<h1>Post</h1>

<p>This blog sucks. I mean, not the information, but the design. It's horrid. It's boring. I have had folks offer to help me out (and I appreciate it!), but I'm just too lazy.</p>
<p>So, here is a challenge for someone bored. If you can give me a new design for this blog, something I can just extra from a zip and go with, I'll give you.... um.... well.... nothing. But I <i>will</i> give you a link. I'll also praise you and tell member of the opposite sex that you are either a) smart, b) super strong, or c) all of the above. I'll flatter you on a post that contains the best Google keywords so your name shows up all over the web.</p>
<p>Really.</p>
<p>So - anyone up to it? Some guidelines:</p>
<p>When I say I just want to extract a zip - I mean it. You should simply overwrite the CSS, the index.cfm, and the pod layout code. I don't really care much about the popups for comment editing.</p>
<p>I love green. Something green would be nice. Not poopoo green as my two year old would say, but dark, warm greens like Hunter Green or &quot;I'm an Important Guy with an Expensive Dark Office&quot; Green. While it isn't very green, <a href="http://www.duoh.com/csstutorials/calendar/index2.html">this</a>  is a good example of the kind of shading, font style, etc, I'm looking for.</p>
<p>Keep the title text if possible. I'm thinking of renaming the blog, so having that part as text would be helpful.</p>
