<p>So it looks like when someone purchases an item from my wishlist and the item is handled by a third party, I don't get a notice of who bought the item. Thanks to the person who bought me KOTOR2 - I really appreciate it!</p>
<p>(And if it isn't obvious yet - I'll do anything for wishlist items. ;)</p>
