<p>Roland Collins made a good point about the slushy code - if you don't maintain order when you shift items left and right, it gets a bit distracting. He made a small mod to my code (err, Ron's code really) to help maintain order. Whenever you do the &quot;All Left&quot; or &quot;All Right&quot;, the items that move maintain their order.</p>
<p>Now, to be anal, it only remembers the orders of the items shifting. So imagine you have A, B, and C in the left column. If you move C to the right, then move all to the right, you end up with C, A, B. It kept &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; in the right order, but didn't remember that originally it was A,B,C. However, this is still better than the way I had it. Download link is in My Tools (or will be in 120 seconds).</p>
