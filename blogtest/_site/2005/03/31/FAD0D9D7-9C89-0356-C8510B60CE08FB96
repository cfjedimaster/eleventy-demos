<p>The latest release of <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/forums">Galleon</a> is now ready. Version 1.2 can be downloaded <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/downloads/forums.zip">here</a>. Changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Password reminder feature.
<li>Message display is a lot cleaner. I now use <a href="http://www.cflib.org/udf.cfm/paragraphformat2">ParagraphFormat2</a> to render the text and also <a href="http://www.cflib.org/udf.cfm/activateurl">ActivateURL</a> to auto-hyperlink stuff.
<li>You can now reply on the message page itself. This makes it easier to respond to a message later in the thread.
<li>There were some mySQL issues reported, but I haven't been able to duplicate them. So mySQL folks - let me know if you run into anything.
</ul>
<p>As always - if you find this program useful, take a gander at my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/registry/2TCL1D08EZEYE">wishlist</a>. (Geeze, how many times can I mention the wishlist before people figure out I only code for video games??)</p>
