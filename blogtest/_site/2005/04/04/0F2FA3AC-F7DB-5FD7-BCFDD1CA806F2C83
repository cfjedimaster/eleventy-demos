<p>Minor updates:</p>
<ul>
<li>There was a bug with getActiveDays and mySQL. Peter (not sure of his last name) found it and even wrote the fix for it. Thank you, Peter!
<li>I hate to release just bug fixes, so I also added (officially) <a href="stats.cfm">Stats</a>. It now works in all three databases. Enjoy the table-goodness. I wanted to added some charts, but thought that would be overkill. I tend to go crazy with charts. I was even considering a chart showing how many posts you did per day of the week, per month, etc. Then I slowly pulled my hands away from the keyboard and took a deep breath...
<li>BlogCFC.doc updated to mention stats.
<li>The error template will now dump the error if you are in design mode.
</ul>}
