<p>Today I turn 32, and since I know folks are so bored today, let me share what loot I got:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <i>very</i> nice Swiss Army watch. Of course, I have the wrists of a small elf, so I need to get a few links removed.
<li>A Christmas tree in a glass jar. Ok - I know it's not Christmas, but I love Christmas decorations, so this will be on my desk all year long.
<li>The coolest - absolute best - neatest - geekiest Star Wars toy possible.... Darth Tater!!
</ul>}
