<p>I've been a fan of CFLOGIN for quite some time. Both BlogCFC and Galleon use it - as do most of my applications. But the troubles and limitations with the framework are really starting to get to me.</p>
<p>If you don't remember, there were various security issues with the framework from CFMX 6 to 6.1 (even with the updater). There are also some things that are missing that don't make sense: isAuthenticated (don't even get me started about how you couldn't write a UDF with that name till CFMX7), getUserGroups, etc. Of course, you could work your way around the things that were missing - but the security problems simply made CFLOGIN unuseable.</p>
<p>I had a user report that they had an issue using Galleon under IIS. Turns out - their IIS directory had security applied to it. CFLOGIN, by default, will &quot;auto-detect&quot; if you are logged in via the web server. In this case, my app thought the user was logged in, when in reality, they had never actually logged into the application.</p>
<p>The bug (which is my fault) I believe lies here:</p>
<div class="code">function isLoggedOn() {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return getAuthUser() neq <FONT COLOR=BLUE>""</FONT>;<br>
}</div>
<p>This is the code I use to check and see if a user is logged on or not. When the user logged in using IIS, the application thought there were logged on. So, I'm thinking the fix is to simply add a session flag and check for that. I normally don't ever access session (or application, server, etc) variables from a UDF, but this is a good example (I think) of when breaking the rules is ok.</p>
<p>The next problem is the cflogin block itself. I need to check and see if the code inside the cflogin block is run when the user has authenticated in IIS. If not, I need to rewrite the logic and not really on the &quot;conditional&quot; nature of the cflogin block.</p>
<p>So - I kinda ranted on the cflogin feature here - and I don't really intend to. I'm going to work with the user and see if we can get Galleon playing nicely with his IIS secured directory. When that happens, or if I have to rip out cflogin entirely, I'll post again.</p>
