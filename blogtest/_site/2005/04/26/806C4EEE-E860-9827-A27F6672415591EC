<p>I swear... I mean I <i>really</i> swear I'm not trying too hard to push Star Wars on my eldest son. I do talk a lot about SW - and he obviously sees my joy when I open up SW gifts for my birthday - but I do promise that I'm not <i>trying</i> to turn my kid into a SW geek.</p>
<p>However.... this is really cool I think:</p>
<p>This weekend I'm standing in line at Home Depot. Or maybe Lowes. To be honest, I'm not much of a &quot;handyman&quot; so both stores simply morph into &quot;The Blue One&quot; and &quot;The Orange One.&quot; Anyway - the whole family is waiting in line while the teenager behind the counter scans our items. All of a sudden - without any prompting from me - my eldest child begins to sing the Imperial March. Not the Star Wars theme - but the Imperial March.</p>
<p>Then - yesterday morning - he comes out of his room with a blanket behind him. He tells me that he wants to be like Darth Vader.</p>
<p>My son - the 5 year old Lord of the Sith. Am I proud? You bet. My daughter isn't so interested in  Star Wars - but my youngest recognizes Yoda already.</p>
