<p>I swear I'm not posting this just to get a May entry up...</p>
<p>I've started using my ipod a lot more recently and the more I use it - the more <i>right</i> it feels... by <i>right</i> I mean it seems to be the perfect hardware device. I noticed then when I gently rubbed my finger on it to crank up a song I was listening to. It reminds me of Tom Cruise waving his hands in the air to use his computer in &quot;The Minority Report.&quot;</p>
<p>I've falled in love with a new band. If you get a chance, check out <a href="http://www.brainwashed.com/outhud/">Out Hud</a>. I read about them from another blog where they were described as a female New Order. To me, it sounds more like a cooler version of Lucsious Jackson, with maybe a bit of New Order thrown in. Be sure to listen to &quot;How Long.&quot;</p>
<p>I've been warching the new Dr. Who series. Sorry, I mean my friend in England has. I haven't been bittorrenting them - I swear. Anyway - I'm really enjoying it. They seem to have captured the mood of the old series quite well, and the new Dr. Who is fun to watch (although I believe he will only be on for one season). The episode with the Dalek is quite cool. Is it odd that two of my favorite shows now come from England? I wonder if they will start up the Prisoner again!</p>
