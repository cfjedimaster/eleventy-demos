<p>On a totally unrelated note - today is the 3rd anniversary of my daughter's &quot;Gotcha&quot; day. That's the day a child joins a family through adoption. Three years ago today a young, very small girl was placed in our arms... screaming. (And she is still loud - I can't wait till she is a teenager.)</p>
