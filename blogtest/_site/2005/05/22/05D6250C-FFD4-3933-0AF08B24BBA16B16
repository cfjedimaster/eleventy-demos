<p>Two big bugs fixed in this update. First - if you ran the tag in edit mode and the data file didn't exist, you would get an error. Secondly - if you had more than one editor on the page, you wouldn't get the correct behavior. This should be ok now.</p>
<p>Note that the tag saves data in the Application scope, and now also saves data in the request scope to keep down on the HTML it outputs. It still outputs the JavaScript function N times, but I'm not so worried about that.</p>
<p>You can download the tag <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/downloads/simplecontenteditor.zip">here</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to Emmet McGovern for finding these issues.</p>
