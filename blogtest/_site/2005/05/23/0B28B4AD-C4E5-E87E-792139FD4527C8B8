<h1>Post</h1>

<p>So, this weekend, I got what could be consider a mild flame from a user on the blog. You can see it in the first comment on this <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm?mode=entry&entry=05D6250C-FFD4-3933-0AF08B24BBA16B16">blog post</a>. So, I responded fairly (to be honest, SimpleContentEditor didn't have a lot of testing, but most of my other apps do get tested), but then something occured to me. The name of the person flaming me - Angus McLaren - sounded <i>very</i> familiar.</p>
<p>I then found this <a href="http://www.camdenfamily.com/morpheus/blog/index.cfm?mode=entry&entry=395FE000-F222-7374-F662E94E23DA282F">posting</a> from September of 2003.</p>
<p>So - if I do have an enemy - he is <i>very</i> slow in his attacks. He is quite lazy. Of course, so am I - so it is entirely possible I'm writing the posts myself ala Johnny Depp in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0363988/">Secret Window</a>.</p>
