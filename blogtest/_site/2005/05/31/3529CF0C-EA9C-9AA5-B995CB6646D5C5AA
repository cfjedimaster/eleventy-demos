<p>I'm up in Boston till Friday. Something is definitely wrong with this city. Tomorrow is June. Yesterday I was BBQing in my back yard back in Louisiana. Yet now I'm sitting in a hotel room with the <i>heater</i> cranked up!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.woxy.com">Woxy</a>, the absolute best online music station, has released a new station <a href="http://www.woxy.com/vintage">Woxy Vintage</a>. As you can tell by the name, it's older alternative music. So far the selection has been quite nice.</p>

<p>Speaking of vintage alt-rock, I heard a New Wave song a few days ago that was pretty good. For the life of me, I couldn't figure out why I hadn't heard it before. Then I discovered it was the latest by Kelly Osbourne. Good song - very good song - just a good song from 20 years ago. (Was she even alive then??)</p>

<p>Use Greasemonkey and Gmail? Over the last few days my Gmail account has been getting locked for no reason. They unlock my account after a little while, but get this - I write them to request more information, and they actually asked me to send them my original invite email. Um... are you saying the <i>only</i> way you can provide me support is if I kept the stupid invite email?!?! Did you keep yours? For now I've disabled the Gmail script I was using, but I hope to add it back - it was a Delete button. I can see how that would be a violation of the TOS (ahem).</p>
