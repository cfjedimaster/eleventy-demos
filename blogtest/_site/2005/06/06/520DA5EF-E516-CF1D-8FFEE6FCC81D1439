<p>Various places are <a href="http://news.com.com/Macromedia+aligns+with+Eclipse/2100-1032_3-5730781.html?tag=nefd.top">reporting</a> about Macromedia's announcement to create a new IDE based on Eclipse called Zorn. When I first saw the headlines this morning, I was pretty excited. I thought perhaps they were going to put their support into CFEclipse - or even if not - at least give us a nice new code editor to make up for the death of HomeSite+. However, it appears as if Zorn will only be for Flash development. I suppose that is nice and all - but I'd love to see MACR help out those of us who use CF (or JRun). Of course - it would be awesome if they helped out the best option out there now - CFEclipse.</p>
