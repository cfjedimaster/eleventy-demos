<h1>Post</h1>

<p>A very minor update. Here are the changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Last week I mentioned an issue with the RSS feeds chopping off in the middle of HTML tags. (This is in the 'short' version.) The fix was posted, but is now rolled into source.
<li>Rey Bango found an issue with the use of &lt;code&gt; blocks under BlueDragon. Charlie Arehart of <a href="http://www.newatlanta.com">New Atlanta</a> and him worked together on a fix I was able to just paste in.
</ul>}
