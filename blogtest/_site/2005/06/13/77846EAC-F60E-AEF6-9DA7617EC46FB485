<p>Christian Cantrell posted today about <a href="http://weblogs.macromedia.com/cantrell/archives/2005/06/msn_plays_the_b.cfm">MSN's entry into the &quot;Beta Game.&quot;</a> This brought up something that I've been thinking about the last few days... what exactly are the timeframes for all of these beta applications to actually go into &quot;final&quot; release mode?</p>
<p>For example - I'm currently using GMail (for my listservs, I use Thunderbird for my main mail), MS Antispyware, and other applications that are in beta. It makes me wonder when these applications will ever hit 1.0 - especially GMail. I would say GMail is pretty darn good now (except for the silly lack of ability to delete an entire folder).</p>
