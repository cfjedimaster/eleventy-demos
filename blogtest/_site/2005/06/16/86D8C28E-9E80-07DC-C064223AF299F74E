<h1>Post</h1>

<p>Two days ago I <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm?mode=entry&entry=7C9827C2-F04D-709E-CBE5BF25FC1B7BF4">blogged</a> about how it was a bit hard to find the updates to CFMX 7. That's because there were only hot fixes, no real &quot;Updater&quot; yet (although one is on the way). Macromedia.com updated their site today and now things are a bit clearer. When you go to the main <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/downloads/updates/">updates</a> page, you will see a link to the <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/coldfusion/downloads_updates.html">CF Updates</a> page in a pod in the upper right hand corner. Nice and obvious. Now listed on that page are the hot fixes!</p>
<p>I'd like to take the credit for this, but sources tell me it was already in the works... but hey, I'll take the credit anyway. :)</p>
