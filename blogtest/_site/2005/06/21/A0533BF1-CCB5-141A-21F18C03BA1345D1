<p>Last year, it was the support of my readers that helped convince Macromedia to hold an &quot;official&quot; BOF (Birds of a Feather) for CFC development. I like to think it was quite a success as well. So once again I'm asking my readers (those attending MAX anyway ;) to help out. If you can send email to conference@macromedia.com in support of the CFC BOF, it will really help out.</p>
