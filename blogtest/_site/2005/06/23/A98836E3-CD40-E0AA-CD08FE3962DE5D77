<p>Am I the only one addicted to UPS Tracking? When I have a package in route (this time it's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0006TI9WG/002-5827188-6427215?%5Fencoding=UTF8&v=glance">this</a>), I tend to reload the UPS Tracking page about 50 times a day until it arrived. I don't know - it's something about seeing each city show up as the package makes it way to me. If they added GPS, I'd probably get no work done.</p>
