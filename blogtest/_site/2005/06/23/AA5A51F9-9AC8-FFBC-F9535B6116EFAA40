<p>So as I prepare for my presentation at CFUNITED, I'm digging deeper and deeper into Verity. Today Tom Jordhahl <a href="http://tjordahl.blogspot.com/2005/06/which-english-do-you-want.html">posted</a> a note about the use of the EnglishX locale in CFMX7. It is highly recommended reading for those using Verity under CFMX7.</p>
