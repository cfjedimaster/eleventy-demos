<p>In my last <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm?mode=entry&entry=A9DD4434-E9B2-6491-A9B9CABBB23F20E2">post</a>, Mike D brings up some additional points about what I could do to make BlogCFC more search engine friendly.</p>
<p>One idea was to get rid of the UUIDs. I'm not convinced that it will be worth the trouble, so I'm tabling that for now (sorry Mikey!).</p>
<p>The other idea was to add SES URLs. Now, for a while now I've told people they can do this easily enough themselves using Apache Rewrite (or the IIS equivalent). I spoke a bit with Rob on this matter, and he suggested that some users simply may not want to go through the trouble.</p>
<p>So, I'm considering adding them in. It will be a bit of a pain though to test with both IIS and Apache, but I can handle it.</p>
<p>So now my question is this: I can add SES URLs and simply enforce a format that I think is best. I'm thinking this:</p>
<p>(And note - for both proposals, the SES URL is ONLY for direct links to entries. So only the links to entries in index.cfm, and the RSS links, would change.)</p>
<p>http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/XXXXXXXX-etc/Title_Of_The_Blog_Post</p>
<p>This format is simple and would be the easiest to add. Rob suggested, however, that I let folks have a bit of freedom with the URL. I would create a simple meta syntax you would edit in the ini file. So if you wanted YYYY/MMMM/UUID/TITLE for example, you would... well type what I just typed.</p>
<p>Another option - did I say there were 2? I lied. Some people would love to get rid of the UUID. One format Rob pointed out to me was...</p>
<p>YYYY/MMMM/TITLE_WITH_UNDERSCORES</p>
<p>Now, there is one problem with this format. If you have 2 entries on the same day with the same title , we can only serve up one. Now, I'm fine with that. I can document it and warn folks about it. It does make a nice, small URL. In fact, I think I'm leaning towards that format and not letting it be configurable.</p>
<p>So - thoughts? Since I leave in a few days for CFUNITED, and then vacation, let's make it quick folks. ;)</p>
