<p>I was a bit... off... on the number of maximum documents per server with Verity. It's not 250k, but 125k for Enterprise. For CFMX standard the limit is 125k. For the develop edition, 10k. So I was only off by 125k or so.</p>
<p>Next - Tom Jordhal pointed this out to me. A person in the session asked if cfindex/cfsearch operations were safe if you used multiple instances of CFMX per box, all talking to the same collection. I said no. Actually, it is safe and can be done without cflock. It is a problem, however, if you have N boxes sharing the same collection with mapped network drives. Sorry about that folks!</p>
<p>I would also like to ask anyone who attended my session to give me any feedback you think is relevant. Feel free to post anonymously.</p>
<p>More later...</p>
<p>And no, my luggage still hasn't arrived.</p>
