<p>I'm working on the next release of the BlogCFC 3.8 version. I hope to have it out by the end of this week. It <em>may</em> be feature complete, with docs even, but will still be marked as a beta since there are significant changes involved.</p>
<p>Quick question: How many people would want Postgres support?</p>
