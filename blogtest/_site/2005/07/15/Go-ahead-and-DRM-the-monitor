<p>Slashdot is <a href="http://it.slashdot.org/it/05/07/15/155216.shtml?tid=109&tid=172&tid=158&tid=155">reporting</a> that Longhorn will contain a new feature called PVP-OPM (Protected Video Path - Output Protection Management). Longhorn will notice if your monitor supports DRM, and if not, may block protected content from being displayed.</p>
<p>This, of course, according to Slashdot, is the end of the world. (To be fair, the article is matter of fact, I'm speaking more towards the comments.)</p>
<p>I simply cannot understand all the hue and cry over all of this. Folks - we have an option. Don't upgrade. If you can't get the latest Backstreet Boys CD because it won't play on your &quot;unsecure&quot; monitor, don't buy it! DRM, like peer-to-peer, is not evil. It is a technology, nothing more, nothing less. If you don't like how the technology is applied, don't buy it.</p>
<p>Some may say, well, the mass of people don't care. Guess what then - that is democracy and capitalism in action. If folks don't care that they can't back up their media or play their files on other machines, then that's the end of it. Media companies are jerks. Big stupid jerks. If they would have had their way, we never would have had VCRs. But at the end of the day, they sell a product. You can choose to not buy their product.</p>
