<p>I got an email today from a presenter at CFUNITED who spoke after one of my sessions. Apparently a few of my reviews accidently got stuck in his pile. One of the comments was... and I kid you note:</p>
<p><b>What did you like?</b><br>
Excellent sample code</p>
<p><b>What do you think could improve?</b><br>
Pink shoes.</p>
<p>Hmmm. So last year I had projector problems. This year my shoes were too boring. Oh well, folks should have been happy I was even dressed considering the airlines lost my luggage. ;) (At least the person gave me perfect scores!)</p>
