<p>I've been interested in <a href="http://www.model-glue.com">Model-Glue</a> since it was first release, and I'm finally starting my first site on it - a complete rewrite of <a href="http://www.cflib.org">CFLib.org</a>. I thought it might be helpful to others if I share my development process along with the problems I run into. Bear in mind - I'm a MG newbie so I will probably do things the 'wrong' way, but I figured it might be helpful to other MG noobs if I shared. I'm also going to put the site online while it is in dev mode - but that may take a little while.</p>
<p>So - let's start with the first problem I ran into. To install MG, you can simply copy the ModelGlue folder from the zip to the root of your web site. You can then copy the &quot;ModelGlueApplicationTemplate&quot; to your web site to use as a bare-bones MG application.</p>
<p>So far so good. (More information can be found <a href="http://www.model-glue.com/quickstart/index.html#install">here</a>.) However - I don't like application resources to be under web root. MG has a set of folders: config, controller, model, and views that I felt needed to be moved out of web root. I also wanted to move Application.cfm out of web root as well. I did that, viewed my site, and promptly got this error:</p>
<p>Model-Glue: C:\projects\beta.cflib.org\wwwroot/config/ModelGlue.xml can't be found.</p>
<p>So - being the lazy person I am, I posted to the <a href="http://lists.topica.com/lists/modelglue">MG List</a> and promptly got a response from Sean saying I could fix this by simply adding:</p>
<p>&lt;cfset ModelGlue_CONFIG_PATH = expandPath(&quot;..&quot;) &amp; &quot;/config/ModelGlue.xml&quot; /&gt;</p>
<p>to my index.cfm file before the call to cfinclude the MG code. The sad thing is that this very line is described in index.cfm and I just missed it. Either way - I'm making progress!</p>
