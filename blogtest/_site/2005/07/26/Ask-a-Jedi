<p>After about two weeks of almost constant blog postings - I found myself with a delimma today. I couldn't think of one thing to write about. So - here's an idea. If you have any questions(*), post them here, and I'll write up the answers as blog postings.</p>

<ul>
<li>Why do you use CFCs in your blog code?

<li>How do estimate the airspeed velocity of an unladen (African) swollow?
</ul>}
