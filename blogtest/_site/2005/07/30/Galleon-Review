<p>I got this today in my email and just had to share it:</p>
<blockquote>
I have been looking for an easy to modify forum code for the past two
weeks. Not liking any I found I settled for an asp forum yesterday
afternoon. I am not very proficient in asp. I spent four hours trying
to get it to integrate with my site. Almost had it there after supper
last night when a message you sent on the bluedragon list came in. I
downloaded your code. This morning in about an hour I had an operating forum.

<p>Just wanted to say thanks, this is the forum I am going to be using.</p>

<p>This is nice to hear. As I've said - I'm spending a lot more time on Galleon now that I feel BlogCFC is at a good level. I may even have a minor release tonight.</p>
