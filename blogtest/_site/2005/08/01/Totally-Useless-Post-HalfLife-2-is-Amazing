<p>So I got Half-Life 2 today (thanks to a wishlist purchase, thanks Jake!). I installed it and then quickly ran it to see how nice the graphics were.</p>
<p>My God. At 1920x1200, high detail, the game is the most beautiful thing I've seen on a computer screen. Ever. (Of course, to be fair, I have a dual core XPS Gen5 with a Radeon X850 XT PE.) I haven't played more than 20 minutes - but I can't wait to get into this game.</p>
