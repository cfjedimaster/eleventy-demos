<p>The <a href="http://www.atlasventure.com">Atlas Venture</a> site launched today. Atlas Venture is a venture capital firm based
out of Waltham with offices in London, Paris and Munich. I was responsible for the code, except for the cool Flash-based finders you will find in the <a href="http://www.atlasventure.com/ourteam">Team</a> and <a href="http://www.atlasventure.com/ourportfolio">Portfolio</a> pages. (Although I did the backend CFC for it. :)</p>
