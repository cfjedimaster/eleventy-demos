<p>I thought it might be helpful if I shared the URL Rewriting rules I built for the <a href="http://mg.cflib.org">Model-Glue version of CFLib</a>. Right now, only two events work, showLibraries and showLibrary. Here are the rules as defined in Apache:</p>
<p>RewriteRule /showLibraries /?event=showLibraries [PT,NC]<br>
RewriteRule /showLibrary/([0-9]+)/(.*) /?event=showLibrary&amp;id=$1 [PT,NC]<br></p>
<p>This basically means that if 'showLibraries' is found in the URL, it should be rewritten to the right event format for MG.</p>
<p>The second rule is a bit more complex. The URLS for linking to a library look like so</p>
<p>/showLibrary/9/StrLib</p>
<p>They include the ID and the library name. So my regex simply checks for &quot;showLibrary&quot;, a value number, and it ignores the string at the end.</p>
<p>I had to rewrite the regex a tiny bit for ISAPIRewrite. It uses different flags for one. (In Apache, NC means ignore case. In ISAPIRewrite, the flag is I.) Also, the ? had to be escaped in ISAPIRewrite.</p>
