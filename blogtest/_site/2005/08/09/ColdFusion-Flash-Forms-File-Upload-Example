<p>As readers of this blog know, I'm a big fan of the new Flash Forms features in CFMX7. However, my skills with the forms pale in comparison to the guys over at AS Fusion. They have posted a new demo of a simple custom tag that lets you do <a href="http://www.asfusion.com/blog/entry/file-upload-with-coldfusion-flash-forms">file uploads</a> with Flash Forms and the new Flash 8 beta. Neat stuff!</p>
