<h1>Post</h1>

<p>As a followup to my last <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2005/8/6/Dell-Update-Number-2432940">post</a>, I thought I'd share something either very funny, or very sad.</p>
<p>Yesterday I got this email (except):</p>
<blockquote>
Thank you for contacting Dell's Technical Support. It was a pleasure working with you in our attempt to resolve the issue you are having with your system. 
</blockquote>
<p>I suppressed the urge to go postal, and responded back to them how they had promised to call me back (twice) and had not called me back. I mentioned in that last post that the battery seemed to be working <i>much</i> better, but unfortunately that is not the case. I know seem to be stuck around an hour and five minutes for my battery. This is an improvement - but not worth the one hundred and eighty dollars I spent.</p>
