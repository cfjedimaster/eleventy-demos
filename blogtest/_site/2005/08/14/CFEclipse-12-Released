<p>I know almost everyone else in the world is blogging it, but when it concerns something this good - it needs to be repeated. Version 1.2 of <a href="http://www.cfeclipse.org/">CFEclipse</a> has been released. Lots of nice new stuff in this release including SQL color coding. Check it out. Eclipse is <i>not</i> incredibly easy to get into - but once you do, you won't regret it.</p>
