<p>This morning, the Mac arrived. For a bunch of silly pictures that has no real benefit for anyone - follow the More link...</p>

<p>So, as I was saying, the Mac arrived this morning. I knew it was &quot;Mini&quot;, but I couldn't believe how small it was, and how well designed it felt. Most PCs feel - I won't say weak per se, but but like they could be pushed over with a small breeze. The Mac Mini feels like a small, extremely sturdy brick. Not that it is heavy, it just feels solid.</p>

<p>The above picture is simply the contents of the box unpackaged. For comparison, the picture below is the contents compared to one 2 year old child:</p>

<p>As you can see, the Mac Mini is pretty small, even compared to a small tot. (Although the kid is cooler and has more potential to earn money when he becomes a quarterback for the Saints. What? It can happen!)</p>

<p>I carried the pieces up stairs (but not the tot, all my kids want to do in my office is play with the Star Wars stuff - don't they realize they aren't toys??). I plugged stuff in and turned the machine on. First problem. I can't get any video on my Sony 18 inch. I do a quick Google check and turns out many of the VGA dongles are in bad shape. I do a quick check using my main Dell LCD with DVI:</p>

<p>Look at that. A thing of beauty I tell ya. I do some more fiddling and discover the VGA issue is my fault and I now have it running on my secondary monitor.</p>
<p>I haven't spent a <i>lot</i> of time with the Mac so far - I do have to earn some money during the day - but I just can't get over how beautiful the OS is. I've got Firefox running already and will soon have Eclipse installed. The performance seems pretty &quot;zippy&quot; too, which wasn't what I expected. I did get a gig of ram, but I thought the processor would feel a lot more sluggish compared to my Dell. So far, it seems to run nicely. Anyway - just thought I'd share!</p>
