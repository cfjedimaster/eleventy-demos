<p>A new technote was released yesterday concerning Verity:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.macromedia.com/cfusion/knowledgebase/index.cfm?id=cb2d5c2f"> ColdFusion MX 7: Verity custom collection indexing limit of 65520 rows</a></p>
<p>If you are indexing huge record sets, this will apply to you. Of course, do not forget that CFMX Standard has a limit of 125k records per box, and CFMX Enterprise has a limit of 250k records. That is per box - not just collection. Of course, if your records are that big - you are probably a candidate for the full Verity solution, and you can still use ColdFusion with it of course.</p>
