<p>So I'm a big fan of sharing coding mistakes, since I think there are mistakes that many of us make - and are probably too ashamed too admit. This morning all of my web sites were down. The rest of the box was running fine though, so I figured it was probably a ColdFusion issue. (Make that - an issue with one of my ColdFusion pages, not ColdFusion itself.)</p>
<p>One of the sites on the box is <a href="http://www.rsswatcher.com">RSSWatcher.com</a>. This is a simple site that does one thing and one thing only. It allows you to register a search term (or terms) and a set of related RSS feeds. So you could search for &quot;Iran&quot; or &quot;Iraq&quot; and monitor CNN, Fox News, and MSNBC. Whenever an item in one of those news feeds shows up that matches your terms, an email would be sent to you.</p>
<p>Obviously this is done with a lot of CFHTTP calls. I do my best to make this code as light weight as possible. So if two people are using the CNN RSS feed, it will only be fetched once per cycle.</p>
<p>This worked fine. In general, the template would run slow, but not horribly slow, around 800-900 seconds, which is a bit over ten minutes. The last entry from last night though showed a duration of 5000 seconds. Not good.</p>
<p>So what went wrong? Very simple. I forgot to specify a timeout for the cfhttp call. Pretty dumb. This meant CF would wait forever for a particular HTTP call to end. I reworked the code to include a timeout of 15 seconds, which is more than enough time for a remote RSS feed to respond.</p>
<p>The docs for <a href="http://livedocs.macromedia.com/coldfusion/7/htmldocs/00000272.htm">CFHTTP</a> have this to say about the timeout property for the tag:</p>
<blockquote>
Value, in seconds, that is the maximum time the request can take. If the timeout passes without a response, ColdFusion considers the request to have failed.
<p>If the client specifies a timeout in the URL search parameter (for example, ?RequestTime=120) ColdFusion uses the lesser of the URL timeout and the timeout attribute value; this ensures that the request times out before, or at the same time as, the page.</p>
<p>If the URL does not specify a timeout, ColdFusion uses the lesser of the Administrator timeout and the timeout attribute value.</p>
<p>If the timeout is not set in any of these, ColdFusion waits indefinitely for the cfhttp request to process.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another tip - make friends with CFLOG. Intensive use of logging helped me monitor and correct this issue. By the way, the process now runs in under three minutes, which is significantly better.</p>
