How can I encrypt text via PGP using CFMX (on Windows)?

<p>ColdFusion has no native PGP abilities. However, you can find solutions on the Developer's Exchange. In fact, there is a free CFC-based one called <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/cfusion/exchange/index.cfm?view=sn131&extID=1010167">PGP CFC</a>. I haven't tested this myself, but you might want to check it out.</p>
<p>On a side note - ColdFusion MX 7 added many new encryption features. Check out the docs for <a href="http://livedocs.macromedia.com/coldfusion/7/htmldocs/00000457.htm">Encrypt</a>.</p>
