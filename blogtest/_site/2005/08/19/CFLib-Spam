<p>So, yesterday, an errant program accidently triggered the CFLib weekly email to go out early. It also seemed to trigger it a few times. Since I have over four thousand subscribers, this created a huge glut on my mail server. I didn't realize anything was wrong until my wife noticed she hadn't gotten her daily emails.</p>
<p>I'm in the process now of trying to clean out the outbound queue.</p>
<p>It is possible you may get one or more additional CFLib emails.</p>
<p>I <i>deeply</i> apologize. I know exactly how it happaned and I'm pretty darn sure it won't happen again.</p>
<p>CFLib has run for many years now and the email service has been, at least in my opinion, pretty darn stable. I hope folks will understand this was just a one-time glitch.</p>
<p>Some people have demanded to be removed. I'm sad to see you go, but if you really do want to be removed, simply email me at: ray@camdenfamily.com. I'll remove you as soon as possible.</p>
