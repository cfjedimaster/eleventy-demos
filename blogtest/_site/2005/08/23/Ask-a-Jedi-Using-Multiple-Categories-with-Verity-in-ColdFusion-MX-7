<p>Scott asks:</p>
<blockquote>
In terms of Verity, how can you specify multiple categories for an item to be indexed?
</blockquote>
<p>This is really rather simple, and is covered in the doc for <a href="http://livedocs.macromedia.com/coldfusion/7/htmldocs/00000278.htm">cfindex</a>. You can specify multiple categories for an item by simply passing a list to the category attribute. However, you cannot specify more than one category tree.</p>
