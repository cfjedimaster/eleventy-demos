<p>Tell me if you've done this before....</p>
<p>You visit a site. You find it has an error. You hunt down the method to contact the site (not always an easy task). You write an email explaining the issue.</p>
<p>And then nothing. No response. No thank you. No response at all, except for perhaps a form letter response.</p>
<p>About a month or so ago I found a bug on a few local sites. After emailing the owner, the email bounced back to me. So I sent an email to (practically) every other email address I found on the site - and while the bug was fixed, I never heard back.</p>
<p>This wouldn't bug me as much if it didn't happen so often.</p>
<p>Maybe I should stop emailing folks and simply <i>blog</i> the errors when I find them.... or would that be mean??</p>
