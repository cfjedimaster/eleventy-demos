<p><a href="http://www.depechemode.com">Depeche Mode</a> have released their newest single, &quot;Precious&quot;, and it actually is pretty good. I've been a fan of DM for <i>many</i> years, and own every single album, but to be honest, I just haven't been excited about their last few offerings. The new single, however, sounds quite a bit like their old stuff (Violator-era), and while the lyrics don't do much for me, the beat is pretty darn good.</p>
<p>I had the pleasure of seeing Depeche Mode perform in New Orleans many years ago (for their Songs of Faith and Devotion tour) and they were quite good in person. Every song they played was &quot;mixed&quot; a bit making it a surprise once the music started playing. Made for an interesting and fun concert.</p>
