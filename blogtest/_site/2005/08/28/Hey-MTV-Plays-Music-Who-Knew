<p>So, I'm watching the MTV Video Music Awards. Well, not really. I DVRed it and I'm fast forwarding through about 95% of it. Frankly, the whole &quot;Diddy&quot; thing is so ridiculous that I just can't stand it. Really the only good thing about the show is the Beavis and Butthead clips.</p>
<p>However - there is something interesting going on. MTV is running a new set of commercials based on old wives tales. One, for example, involves the saying that you shouldn't make a face because it could stick.</p>
<p>So what's the point of the campaign? That not everything you hear is true - including the &quot;rumour&quot; that MTV doesn't play music.</p>
<p>Um.... gee.... who would have thought that? Maybe it's because you <i>don't</i> play music anymore. Or when you do, you have screaming teenagers doing &quot;shout outs&quot; during the video. Or you only play part of the video. Or you play about, oh, 10 or so videos over and over again.</p>
<p>But really, I swear I'm not a bitter old man who fondly remembers the old days. Really. Back to the Weather Channel.</p>
