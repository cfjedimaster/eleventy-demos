<p>For those who are worried (or just curious), Hurricane Katrina should be a bit to the east of where I live (Lafayette). They are calling for winds around 20-30 MPH with gusts up to 60. Even with that though we are on the &quot;good&quot; site so I'm not too worried.</p>
<p>What <i>worry</i> me is electricity. We tend to lose like a third-world country, so I wouldn't be surprised if I'm off the grid for a day, maybe even more. Just want folks to know in case I don't respond to mail, Ask a Jedi questions, etcetera etcetera.</p>
<p>On the other hand - today is probably the hottest day of the year. I think it's around 140 degrees or so. Thank God for air coditioning.</p>
