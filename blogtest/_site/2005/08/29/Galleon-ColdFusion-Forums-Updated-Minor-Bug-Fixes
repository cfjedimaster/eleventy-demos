<p>A few bugs cropped up after I posted the new version (of course). I've refreshed the <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/downloads/forums.zip">zip file</a>. There was a bug in threads.cfc and a queryparam issue under BlueDragon. (I'm still working with New Atlanta on it, so my 'fix' may change again, for now I think it is ok for both CFMX and BD.)</p>
