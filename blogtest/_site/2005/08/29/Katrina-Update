<p>For those who are curious, my family and I are perfectly safe. Lafayette is a good two and a half hours away, and so far, all we have had is a bit of rain and wind. To be honest, the typical summer 'pop up' thunderstorm we have (almost daily) is a lot worst than what I've seen so far. I've got family about 40 minutes to the east and they are having their power flicker on and off, but outside of that are perfectly fine.</p>
