<p>For the past few weeks now I've had issues with Firefox. Almost daily it crashes on me. For the life of me I couldn't figure out what I had changed. I even uninstalled/reinstalled this morning. When I had yet another crash, it suddenly occurred to me. My crashes started after installing the Flash 8 beta. Yes, I know it is a beta, but is anyone else also having this problem? I'm going to roll back to 7 for now.</p>
