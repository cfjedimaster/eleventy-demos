<p>So, I haven't such much about Katrina because, as I posted earlier this week, it didn't do much here. But to give you an idea of how freaky things are getting - this afternoon there were wide spread rumours of rioting in town, including car-jacking and rapes. Lafayette is taking in refugees at the Cajundome (think a mini-Superdome), and the rumour was that when some folks were turned away, they got a bit testy.</p>
<p>I'm serious.</p>
<p>Of course none of it was true, but the police had to come on the local news to calm people down.</p>
