<p>If you are a tech worker in Lafayette due to Katrina, I wanted to send a special invite to the September meeting of the <a href="http://www.acadianammug.org/">Acadiana Macromedia Multimedia User Group</a>. While I highly doubt such things are of <i>any</i> concern to folks displayed by Katrina, I wanted to at least let folks know about the meeting. Anyone is more than welcome to attend and ask <i>non</i>-tech stuff concerning jobs, schools, etc. I also have an older PC that would be &quot;workable&quot; for someone if they ask for it. Meeting details may be found at the site.</p>
