<p>A big thank you goes out to Martin Baur for finding a bug with enclosures. I'm not going to tell you what the bug is - but rather leave it for a ColdFusion 101-style test. First person who can explain the bug (and not laugh at me for making it) will win... um.... well nothing... but hey, it's fun, right?</p>
<p>I did not update the readme, nor the version #. If you are already running the latest version, you just need to copy index.cfm from the client file.</p>
<p>Here is the line that had the bug. Let's see who is first to point the issue out.</p>
