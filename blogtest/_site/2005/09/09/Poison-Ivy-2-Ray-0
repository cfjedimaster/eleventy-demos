<p>So, I've already <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2005/9/6/Plants-1-Raymond-0-and-more-musings-on-Dell-Hell">mentioned</a> my run-in with poison ivy. Since I'm slowly turning into <a href="http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/gallery/2004/05/26/timzaccheo.jpg">Sloth from Goonies</a>, I thought it might be time to get professional help. My eye is swollen; I've got the ivy on both legs and both arms, and my right hand is... scary. I'm not joking. Like my kids run from it.</p>
<p>So last night my wife dropped me off at a &quot;Doc in the Box&quot; and I got both a shot and some nice pills. So far... things <i>maybe</i> seem a bit better. My eye isn't as &quot;Sloth-like&quot; anymore, but the rest of the rashes/blisters look bad, if maybe a bit dimmer.</p>
<p>So, whats the moral of the story? I'll never, ever, touch anything again that is even close to being green and leafy. Period. Nature BAD! Inside GOOD!</p>
