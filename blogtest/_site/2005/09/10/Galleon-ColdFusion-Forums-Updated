<p>I'm happy to announce version 1.4.2 of Galleon ColdFusion Forums. Not a huge update, but here are the changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Admin tables now let you sort (wow).
<li>Admin tables show more info. So when you browse messages, you see the thread, forum, and conference. Makes it easier to find messages. Threads show parent forum and conference now.
<li>"Sticky" sorting wasn't working right in Access. Got to love the Access. 
</ul>
<p>Version 1.4.2 may be download <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/downloads/forums.zip">here</a>.</p>
