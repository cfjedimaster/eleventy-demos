<h1>Post</h1>

<p>This one came in today, and since I just answered a Flash Form question, I tghought I'd add it:</p>
<blockquote>
Ray, is there a way to turn on debugging for flash forms so I can see actionscript errors instead of the form just not compiling and showing a blank page?
</blockquote>
<p>If you go to your CF Admin, Debugging and Logging, Debugging Settings, you will see this option:</p>
<p><b>Flash Form Compile Errors and Messages</b>
(Development use only) Selecting this option causes ColdFusion to display ActionScript errors in the browser when compiling Flash forms, and affects the display time of the page.</p>
<p>You will want to turn this on - but obviously only on your development machine.</p>
<p>You can also get at the full MXML used to generate the form. A blog posted a good entry on how to get to it, but the blog seems to be down for now. In case it returns, here is the <a href="http://www.newsight.de/2005/09/12/how-i-get-the-source-of-a-compiled-flashform/">url</a>.</p>
