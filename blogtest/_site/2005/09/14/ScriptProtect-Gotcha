<p>As I was preparing for my <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/cfusion/event/index.cfm?event=detail&id=288085&loc=en_us">presentation</a> today, I was playing a bit with the new scriptProtect feature of ColdFusion MX7. I turned the option on, performed a test, and was puzzled when scriptProtect didn't actually do anything. Thinking that maybe my Application.cfc was cached, I restarted ColdFusion, but nothing changed.</p>
<p>I checked the docs (always a good idea) and realized I had made a very simple mistake. ScriptProtect expects three possible values. Either &quot;all&quot;, &quot;none&quot;, or a list of ColdFusion scopes to protect. I had done this:</p>
<div class="code"><FONT COLOR=MAROON>&lt;cfset this.scriptProtect = true&gt;</FONT></div>
<p>To me, this just seemed like the natural way to turn on script protection. However, not only did it <b>not</b> work, it never threw an error either. To me, this is a bit dangerous. I had expected my site to be protected, but it wasn't since I had supplied the wrong value. I would normally expect ColdFusion to throw an error, <i>especially</i> with something security related like this. Watch out for it folks!</p>
