<p><a href="http://www.macromedia.com/macromedia/events/max"><img src="https://static.raymondcamden.com/images/maxray.jpg" align="left" border="0"></a>So I was reading <a href="http://slashdot.org">Slashdot.org</a> last night when I noticed something. They had a banner ad for MAX - the same capaign I was a part of. (Yes, I know. I <i>tried</i> to tell Macromedia how scary I look. They didn't listen.) I pinged my contact, and yes, it is true. The Jedi's hairy mug is in both &quot;normal&quot; banners and the skyscraper type ad you see to your left.</p>
<p>I'm not quite sure what to think. Part of me thinks this is so cool. The other part of me thinks... this is soooo incredibly cool. All I need now is a Times Square placement!</p>
