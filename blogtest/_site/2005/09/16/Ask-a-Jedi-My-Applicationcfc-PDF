Have a question regarding your <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/downloads/app.pdf">Application.cfc PDF</a>. I do not understand (I'm a newbie) why you have this.scriptProtect set to false instead of true. Wouldn't it be better to protect it? This is my understanding from the CFMX7 documentation. Thanks.
</blockquote>
<p>To be honest, I didn't think about making the PDF have &quot;best practices&quot; per se - I just wanted a nice 'skeleton' Application.cfc PDF I could use for my own applications, and share with others.</p>
<p>That being said - what <b>should</b> you use for the setting? Unfortunately I have two answers for this. My readers will probably chime in as well (hopefully).</p>
<p>The scriptProtect feature is a very nice addition to CFMX7, although it is not perfect. (See my <a href="http://www.coldfusionjedi.com/index.cfm/2005/9/14/ScriptProtect-Gotcha">last post</a> on it and pay particular attention to Pete's comment.) Of course, nothing is perfect. So normally I'd would say, always turn it on.</p>
<p>However - when you use this feature, you can't disable it. Sometimes you may want to allow potentially dangerous HTML in form entries. For example, on this blog, I have the right to use whatever HTML I want when creating entries. I wouldn't want scriptProtect to stop me. Since the setting is application-wide, I can't just turn it off for me when I'm logged in. That alone is enough reason for me not to use it here. (Although BlogCFC is staying backwards-compat with CFMX 6.1 and BlueDragon 6.2.) If that isn't a concern for you, then I'd say definitely turn the feature on.</p>
