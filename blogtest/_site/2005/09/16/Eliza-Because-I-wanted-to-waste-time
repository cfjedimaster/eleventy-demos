<p>Those old timers out there will remember an old computer program called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliza">Eliza</a>. Eliza was basically a dumb, but sometimes effective, AI type program. You could ask it questions and Eliza would parrot them back. Eliza has been around since 1966 if you can believe it. Anyway, for a long time now I've been wanting to port it to ColdFusion. However, most of the example source code programs I found were extremely hard to read. (Or maybe ColdFusion is making me spoiled. ;) Last night I finally got around to writing a simple implementation.</p>
<p>The logic is simple. You take a string, which is what the human is saying, and look for keywords. If a keyword match is found, you pick a random respond and add what the user said after the keyword.</p>
<p>So for example, if the user says: &quot;I can't swim&quot;, Eliza may say, &quot;How do you know you can't swim&quot;. Nothing terribly sophisticated about it, but sometimes it actually works rather well.</p>
<p>For my version of Eliza, the data is all XML based, making it a lot easier to update the keywords and add additional responses. You can download the code <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/downloads/eliza.zip">here</a>.</p>
<p>Even better - if you are using the Google IM client, or any Jabber client, you can talk to Eliza right now. Simply add the contact, &quot;elizacamden@gmail.com&quot;, and talk away. Have a cool conversation with her? Paste it into the comments.</p>
