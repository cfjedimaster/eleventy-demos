<p>Attention BD users who work with Galleon. Version 1.5 added (finally) a simple error.cfm file to handle errors generated by the forums. (Not that my code ever throws an error.) A user said that this change breaks the admin. Turns out there is a slight difference in BD. Galleon has a top level folder with Application.cfm in it. It then has a cferror tag pointing to just &quot;error.cfm&quot;. The admin sub folder has an Application.cfm that cfincludes the parent Application.cfm. When you hit the admin folder in BD, even if no error occurs, BD notices that &quot;error.cfm&quot; doesn't exist. That is because it is looking for it relative to the Application.cfm in the admin folder. (I'm not typing Application.cfm again - it's too many darn letters.)</p>
<p>So - I'm not 100% of a great answer, but here is a quick mod you can add, <b>only if you are running BlueDragon</b>. This mod goes in the App.cfm file in the <b>root</b> folder, and replaces the cferror tag as it stands now.</p>
