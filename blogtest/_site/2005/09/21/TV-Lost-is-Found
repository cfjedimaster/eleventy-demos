<p>Do not forget that tonight is the season premier of Lost. I raved about this show pretty much all last season. If you haven't given it a chance yet, I strongly urge you to take a look.</p>
<p>Speaking of Lost, let me riff a bit about it. Apparently the entire reason we have <i>so</i> many Sci-Fi shows this season is because of the success of Lost. This just goes to show you exactly how clueless TV executives must be. Lost is an <b>awesome</b> show that just so happens to be have a Sci-Fi element to it. Yes, the Sci-Fi elements work as a hook, but it isn't what makes the show so great. It is the writing - specifically the back stories - and the interaction of the characters that make the show great. I'm not denying the hook of the premise behind Lost, but half-way through the season I found myself caring less and less about the Island and more about the people.</p>
