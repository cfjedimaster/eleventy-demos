<p>So, the BOF (Birds of a Feather) schedule was published a day or two ago, and I was a bit sad to see that my idea for the CFC BOF wasn't accepted. Well, Ben Forta pulled some strings, and it is now on the schedule. The CFC BOF will be at 6:30PM on Tuesday night at MAX. I hope to see everyone there!</p>
