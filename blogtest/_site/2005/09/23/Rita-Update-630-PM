<h1>Post</h1>

<p>For those who are just insanely worried about my status, or have a morbid curiosity to see if I will survive - so far things are ok here. The lights haven't flickered once. The wind is getting very strong and the rain, which is off and on, is <i>extreme</i> when it is on. Will blog again later - power permitting.</p>
