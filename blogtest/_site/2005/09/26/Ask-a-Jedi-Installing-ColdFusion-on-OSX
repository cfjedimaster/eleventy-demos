I hope that you do not mind me asking this.
When I installed CFMX 7 on windows, it was very,very easy. However, I am getting a Mac powerbook,and I read about installing CFMX 7 for the mac requires JRun,and J2EE. I feel so overwhelmed about this, and I was wondering if you could inform me if I should be scared? IS this something that a newcommer should consider hiring somebody for?

<p>It <i>is</i> possible to get CF running on a Mac. However, if you can wait, the newest update to CF, code named Merrimac, has a native OSX installer. (Which rocks by the way.) Sean Corfield has a <a href="http://www.corfield.org/blog/index.cfm/do/blog.entry/entry/CBAF2026-B2F8-08D1-B03ABD13735D431C">teaser</a> of this, which shows both CF running on his Mac and the installer. I'm just now getting into the Mac myself, so I think this is wonderful news.</p>
<p>Just don't ask me when Merrimac will be released. :)</p>
