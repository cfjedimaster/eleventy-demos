<p>This interesting question came in a few days ago:</p>
<blockquote>
What's the easiest way to output a query in columns rather than rows?
</blockquote>
<p>At first, I wasn't sure what the reader meant. Did he mean that he only wanted to display one column from a query? I don't think so. But just in case....</p>
<code>
&lt;cfloop query="data"&gt;
	&lt;cfoutput&gt;#name#&lt;br&gt;&lt;/cfoutput&gt;
&lt;/cfloop&gt;
</code>
<p>Maybe he thought that you needed to output <i>all</i> the values from a query and didn't realize you could just work with one column? Who knows. I've made some pretty silly mistakes in reasoning myself(*).</p>
<p>Then I thought - maybe he wants to &quot;twist&quot; the traditional row by row display of a query and display one column of data as one row of a table. In other words, turn the normal table display around 90 degrees or so. This is also pretty simple. Let's look at the code and then I'll explain it.</p>
<!--more-->
<code>
&lt;cfset data = queryNew("id,name,age")&gt;
<p>&lt;cfloop index=&quot;x&quot; from=&quot;1&quot; to=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;cfset queryAddRow(data)&gt;
&lt;cfset querySetCell(data,&quot;id&quot;,x)&gt;
&lt;cfset querySetCell(data,&quot;name&quot;,&quot;User #x#&quot;)&gt;
&lt;cfset querySetCell(data,&quot;age&quot;,randRange(20,90))&gt;
&lt;/cfloop&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;cfloop index=&quot;col&quot; list=&quot;#data.columnList#&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;cfoutput&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;#col#&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/cfoutput&gt;
&lt;cfloop query=&quot;data&quot;&gt;
&lt;cfoutput&gt;&lt;td&gt;#data[col][currentRow]#&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/cfoutput&gt;
&lt;/cfloop&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/cfloop&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
</code></p>
<p>So, just ignore the beginning. All I'm doing is creating a fake query. I begin my table as you would normally. Now comes the changes. Instead of looping over the query, I loop over the column list. For each column, I start a new table row. I then loop over the query and output <i>only</i> my current column and current row using this syntax:</p>
<code>
data[col][currentRow]
</code>
<p>You may wonder - why didn't I use <a href="http://livedocs.macromedia.com/coldfusion/7/htmldocs/00000662.htm">valueList</a>? For some reason, valueList was built to only allow for a <i>static</i> column. In other words, I would have to hard code data.id, or data.name, etc. You can use <a href="http://livedocs.macromedia.com/coldfusion/7/htmldocs/00000458.htm">Evaluate</a> of course, but that is the tool of the Devil, so I recommend against it.</p>
<p>That's it. If you run this code you will see a nicely transformed query display. Now, I'm not sure <i>why</i> you would do this, but I'm sure there is a good reason. (Of course, half the things I code are for the heck of it and serve no practical purpose!)</p>
<p>*So, what silly mistake did I make? When I was learning AppleSoft BASIC, I read the docs on the syntax, but not very closely. So, I'd write a line of BASIC, and then start on a new line. I'd start on new line by hitting the space bar until the cursor wrapped to a new line. Ok, you can sto laughing now, I was only 12 or so!</p>
