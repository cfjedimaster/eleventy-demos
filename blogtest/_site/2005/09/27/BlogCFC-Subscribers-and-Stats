<p>I was asked today, is there a way to see who is subscribed to your blog? The short answer is yes, if you don't mind editing your stats file. I modified my own copy, outside of what you download, so I could see my subscribers, but only if I was logged in. To add the same mod to your code, simply find stats.cfm, and add this:</p>
<code>
&lt;cfif isUserInRole("admin")&gt;
	&lt;cfquery name="getpeople" datasource="#dsn#"&gt;
	select * from tblblogsubscribers
	&lt;/cfquery&gt;
	&lt;cfdump var="#getpeople#"&gt;
&lt;/cfif&gt;
</code>
<p>It isn't pretty, but works great.</p>
