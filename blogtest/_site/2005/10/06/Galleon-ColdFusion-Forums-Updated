<p>I fixed a bug in Galleon today. It was a major bug in subscriptions which basically made them not work at all. Want to know what I did? When you added a subscription, the code checked to ensure that you had not subscribed already. However, the query didn't check for <b>your</b> user id, so if anyone had subscribed to that resource, no one else could subscribe. -sigh-</p>
<p>I also changed the Login link in the top nav to remember where you were in the site.</p>
<p>I still haven't added the BlueDragon fix. Completely forgot. Check the archives for how to add it though.</p>
<p>You may download Galleon, or see a demo, in the My Tools pod to the right.</p>
