<h1>Post</h1>

<p>Soundings, my ColdFusion survey application, has been updated. You can download Soundings <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/downloads/soundings.zip">here</a>. Changes are listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2005/10/7/Soundings-Bug--Very-Important">nasty bug</a> I reported yesterday.
<li>Changed the display of questions a bit. Don't forget that if you don't like this, it is easy to change. Just modify the display handler for the questions.
<li>If you changed the admin password, logged out and returned, it wouldn't accept your new password. This is because the old one was cached. 
<li>I've finally added support for <b>Matrix</b> questions. There are the questions where you are asked to rank various items from 1-5, good to bad, etcetera. 
</ul>
<p>That's it. The next release will focus on the reporting aspects of Soundings.</p>
