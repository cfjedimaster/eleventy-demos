<p>A reader asks:</p>
<blockquote>
What do YOU consider the best online resource(s) for CFMX Server Administration? All of those XML files and hotfixes can be a little intimidating.
</blockquote>
<p>So, this is an interesting question, because to be honest, I'm not aware of any such thing. Certainly the first place I'd consider is the livedocs version of <a href="http://livedocs.macromedia.com/coldfusion/7/htmldocs/wwhelp/wwhimpl/common/html/wwhelp.htm?context=ColdFusion_Documentation&file=part_adm.htm">Configuring and Administering ColdFusion MX</a>. Outside of that, however, I'm not aware of any resource the focuses just on the Administrator and tuning of the server. Certainly it can be a complex topic. (I had a good 2 hour talk with a smart friend about the proper settings of the JVM.) But some items are simple. (Like did you know you could add <a href="http://livedocs.macromedia.com/coldfusion/7/htmldocs/00001733.htm#1331113">extensions</a> to the CF Admin?)</p>
<p>Can anyone recommend any good URLs? Would this be a good section to add to my <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/forums/forums.cfm?conferenceid=5527DFBD-CC08-F498-C903DAFC2817BB56">ColdFusion</a> forums?</p>
