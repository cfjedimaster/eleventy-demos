<p>So, nothing much to report today. We had the Community College meeting which revealed some interesting details (more on that later). During the meeting we got a chance to grill folks from various product teams. I was with the CF group (of course) and we had a very interesting discussion. There is a three hour session tomorrow on ColdFusion that I encourage folks to attend.</p>
<p>After that meeting I went to the Welcome Reception and then to the User Group Manager/Team Macromedia reception. Since it's two hours later my time and I've been up since 4AM, I returned to my hotel so I could wrap up the code for my presentation.</p>
<p>So - the big news is the release of <a href="http://labs.macromedia.com">Macromedia Labs</a>. I thought this was supposed to be a secret till tomorrow, but apparently it was released today. This is pretty darn neat and serves as an example for other companies to follow.</p>
<p>Along with the release of the Labs, you can now download and play with Flex 2.0. If you ignored Flex before because of it's cost, take a second look. The new Flex Builder 2 is <i>quite</i> nice.</p>
