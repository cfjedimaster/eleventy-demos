<p>Wow. What a difference a year makes. To be honest, last year's keynote wasn't the most exciting I've seen. In fact, I don't remember anything terribly interesting about it. This year was <i>very</i> different. First, they began with a very funny speaker. Comedy is a great way to start things. Then Stephan Elop came on and shocked the heck out of me. Most of his talk was the normal (yawn) biz/dev type stuff. Then he talked about Microsoft. This was one of the coolest things I've heard said at any MAX. Basically, he told MS to &quot;Try Again&quot; (in relation to their new design program). That isn't a joke. That is a direct quote. Dang - that takes guts. Outside of that, there was quite a bit of talk about &quot;Experience&quot;, which is a bit wishy washy, but some interesting demos were shown. I've never been much to care about the &quot;design&quot; side of stuff, but since Flash 8, I'm beginning to see the light a bit. Well, I'd say more, but a conference organizer just made me unplug my laptop, so my battery is just about dead. More later.</p>
