<h1>Post</h1>

<p>This was a pretty good presentation. Dirk Eismann talked about the various different ways you can use debugging in Flex. He discussed his own tool he created that launches a window to receive Flex debug messages, as well as the various other types of debugging available. He touched on updates in Flex 2 as well.</p>
<p>I'm just now doing my first Flex job (to be honest, it's one tab of a greater application, but a pretty cool tab), so this was especially useful.</p>
<p>Sorry for the delay in my postings today. It's been busy! :)</p>
