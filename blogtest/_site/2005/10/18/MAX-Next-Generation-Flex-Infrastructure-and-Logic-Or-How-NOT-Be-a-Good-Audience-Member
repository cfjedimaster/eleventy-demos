<p>So, I want to write about the Flex session ran by Ely Greenfield. Unfortunately, three guys behind me decided to talk throughout the entire presentation.</p>
<p>What makes this more upsetting is that one of the guys talking was a Macromedia person (no one I knew, but Ely asked me a question or two). I did the &quot;Look backwards and frown slightly&quot; thing, but it didn't seem to work. Thanks a lot guys. You know, I understand the whole, turn to your neighbor and say 'how cool' thing, or the, turn to your neighbor and ask 'but what if...' but to run a conversation throughout the entire session is just stupid.</p>
<p>Outside of that - Ely's presentation was a good one, and a nice general into to Flex 2. One of the core themes was - We (Macromedia) saw you (the developer) doing A, B, C just to do one simple task and we did our best to get it down to just A. That is <i>exactly</i> how I want a software company to respond.</p>
