<p>So, like every other red-blooded American, I am extremely egotistical and have an intense need to know what others think of me. (Or maybe it's just me. ;) To help track that, I use <a href="http://www.rsswatcher.com">RSSWatcher</a> to monitor <a href="http://www.fullasagoog.com">FullAsAGoog</a> for the keyword, &quot;Camden.&quot; Yesterday this hit came in:</p>
<p><a href="http://coldfusion.sys-con.com/read/141533.htm">http://coldfusion.sys-con.com/read/141533.htm</a></p>
<p>So - it is my entire article - with a new intro paragraph - reprinted in full. Even some of the comments are copied over.</p>
<p>Now - Sys-Con does aggregate my blog. You can see that <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=3&url=http%3A//coldfusion.sys-con.com/read/rss/92.htm&ei=rtZVQ5rPFY38oQK745WlCA&sig2=Go-_-2D5I9Up4zHdcuPhTw">here</a>. But am I crazy to think that reprinting the entire article from my blog is just... um.... wrong? Especially since we both have Google Ads on our sites. Or should I just get over it? (FYI, I <i>have</i> pinged Simon Horwith on this.)</p>
