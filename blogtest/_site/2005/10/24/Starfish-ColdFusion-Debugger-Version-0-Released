<h1>Post</h1>

<p>So a few days ago I <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2005/10/19/Goodbye-MAX-and-One-More-Thing">blogged</a> about my new project, Starfish. Starfish is essentially a ColdFusion debugger that doesn't display information, but rather stores it in the Server scope. You can then display a report on this data in the CF Admin. I'm now happy to report that the initial version is ready for <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/downloads/starfish.zip">download</a>.</p>
<p>Some <b>BIG WARNINGS</b> - This code is ugly. I'm not kidding. I know that some people have told me they have learned a lot from downloading my code and looking at it. Don't do that. Avoid the code like the plague. Ok, so it's not that bad, but it was written <i>very</i> quickly. I'd call this version more a Proof of Concept than a real application.</p>
<p>That being said - I'd love feedback on it. I've set up a <a href="http:/www.coldfusionjedi.com/forums/forums.cfm?conferenceid=249AB039-9046-9195-0C8FFD2086ADAC6E">forum</a> for the project, so please use it for your ideas. Also, I've <b>finally</b> gotten around to creating a &quot;Projects&quot; site. You can see the Starfish project here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.coldfusionjedi.com/projects/starfish">http://www.coldfusionjedi.com/projects/starfish</a></p>
<p>All of my projects will have a page like this - as I get around to it. As always, if you like this, visit my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/registry/2TCL1D08EZEYE">wishlist</a>. (I'm still waiting for someone to pick up the Nano - what's wrong you people - too cheap?!?! ;)</p>
<p><b>Edited:</b> Oops - so I forgot to mention. The zip has NO instructions. Here are some simple instructions for now:</p>
<p>Unpack the zip.
profiler.cfm goes in cfusionmx7\wwwroot\web-inf\debug
In your cf admin, turn on debugging and select the template.
Take the other files and place them in:</p>
<p>webroot\CFIDE\administrator\profiler</p>
<p>Add this line to extensionscustom.cfm in your cf admin folder:</p>
<p>&lt;a href=&quot;profiler/index.cfm&quot; target=&quot;content&quot;&gt;Profiler&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;</p>
