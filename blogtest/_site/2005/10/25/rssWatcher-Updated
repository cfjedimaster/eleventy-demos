<p>I updated <a href="http://www.rsswatcher.com">RSSWatcher.com</a> today with some suggestions from <a href="http://bluedragon.blog-city.com/">Charlie Arehart</a>. The primary change is an IE CSS fix that caused the profile display to be <i>way</i> pushed down.</p>
<p>For those who don't know, <a href="http://www.rsswatcher.com">RSSWatcher</a> is a site that lets you set up a scheduled search against RSS feeds for search terms. There are other tools like this out there, but I built this for myself as an experiment and turned it into a real web site.</p>
