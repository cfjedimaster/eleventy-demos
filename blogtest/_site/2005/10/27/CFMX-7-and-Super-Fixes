<p>So, I don't think this was in the release notes, but either CFMX7 or 7.0.1 fixes a bug where a super call can't use named arguments. In other words, this used to throw an error:</p>
<code>
&lt;cfreturn super.someMethod(arg1=value1, arg2=value2)&gt;
</code>
<p>As I said, this works fine now. <b>However</b>, if you try the same thing with a simple UDF copied to a structure, like the request scope, an error will occur:</p>
<blockquote>
Cannot invoke method ran on an object of type coldfusion.runtime.RequestScope with named arguments.
Use ordered arguments instead.
</blockquote>
<p>I've filed a bug and hopefully this will be corrected.</p>
