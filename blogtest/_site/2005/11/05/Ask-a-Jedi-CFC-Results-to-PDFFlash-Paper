<p>Thinman asks:</p>
<blockquote>
Can a CFC be coded to to save query results in FlahsPaper and PDF Format?
</blockquote>
<p>This question can be read multiple ways, so I'm not exactly sure how to answer, but I'll do my best. First off - unrelated to CFCs - when you use cfdocument you can store the results instead of actually displaying it. All you need to do is use the name attribute. This stores the binary data in a variable. So can a CFC do this, sure? You could also have the CFC output the data as well, so for example, you could have a dynamic link to a PDF version of a page by linking to:</p>
<p>someCFC.cfc?method=displayPageAsPDF&amp;id=whatever</p>
<p>I don't normally output directly from a CFC, but you certainly could if you wanted.</p>
