<p>This morning I got a &quot;Ask a Jedi&quot; question about Lighthouse Pro. Just to be clear, the Ask a Jedi pod is for general questions. Specific questions about my products should go to the <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/forums">forums</a>. The person who sent it in didn't sign their name, so I hope they read this.</p>
