<h1>Post</h1>

<p>A small update, but with one important fix. Here are the changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>/client/index.cfm: Two fixes to allow title to work right on single entry pages
<li>/client/editor.cfm: fix with &lt;more/&gt; issue. You are no longer allowed to have &lt;more/&gt; in the beginning.
<li>/org/camden/blog/blog.cfc: Two case issues with mysql
<li>/client/stats.cfm: ditto above
</ul>
<p>Thanks to Steven Erat for pointing out some of those bugs, and helping me get my local CF server running again after I switched to JRun. (I must never do that again. -shudder-) Also thanks to Jacob Munson for a few finds as well.</p>
<p>As always, you can download BlogCFC from the <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/projects/blogcfc">project page</a>. I did <b>not</b> update the version number. I'll probably wait until a new feature is added before changing the version.</p>
