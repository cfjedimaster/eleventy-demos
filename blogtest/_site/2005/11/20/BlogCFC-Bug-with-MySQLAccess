<p>I've seen a few reports come in with an error concerning dates and Access/MySQL. This morning I was able to reproduce it - but to be honest, I'm a bit lost. It is an area that hasn't been touched in months, and the data is certainly valid dates. I just wanted to write a note and make sure people know I'm aware of it.</p>
<p>Also - I've gotten quite a bit of trackback spam - but with my trackback spam blocker, each TB spam is normally a <i>new</i> TB spam. So - I think the spam list is working. In the next update to BlogCFC, I'll be sure to include my spam list in the core code. So even if you don't need the MySQL/Access fix, consider copying over the spam list.</p>
