<p>So today I've gotten two trackback pings from one blog, mainbud.blogspot.com. (I'm not using real links for this guy.) What makes this spam interesting is that it seems like he is copying my content. Consider this url: http://mainbud.blogspot.com/2005/11/trackback-support.html</p>
<p>I've already deleted the TB for it. He added another TrackBack this morning that just linked to his home page.</p>
<p>Has anyone heard of people using TB to steal content? I would simply add his URL to the spam list, but I want to see if he 'borrows' more of my content. The interesting thing is that it seems as if there is no direct link to the entry above.</p>
