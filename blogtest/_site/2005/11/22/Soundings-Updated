<p>I've updated Soundings with a very minor bug fix that corrects an issue that can occur while editing Matrix questions. Thanks go to Mal Brisbane for the find. As always, you can downloading Soundings from the <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/projects/soundings">project page</a>. For those who are curious, when I do find the time to spend on Soundings, my next updates will include multiple questions per page and improved reporting.</p>
