<p>A reader asks,</p>
<blockquote>
When you've used OnApplicationStart to store application variables how do you refresh it?
</blockquote>
<p>Simple - I use a URL variable. Inside my onRequestStart, I'll have something like this:</p>
<code>
&lt;cfif structKeyExists(url, "refreshmebabyonemoretime")&gt;
  &lt;cfset onApplicationStart()&gt;
&lt;/cfif&gt;
</code>
<p>A few notes. The name of the URL variable is completely arbitrary. You probably want something people can't guess, but it is up to you to decide how anal/secure you want to be.</p>
<p>Also - remember that when ColdFusion runs onApplicationStart by itself, it does so in a single threaded manner. When you run it, it isn't single threaded. But if you are just setting a bunch of application variables, it probably will not matter to you.</p>
<p>p.s. So hey, did you notice I used structKeyExists instead of isDefined? I'm slowly coming around to it. ;)</p>
