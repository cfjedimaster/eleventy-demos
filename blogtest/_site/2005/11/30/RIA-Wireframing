<p>I try not to repost stuff covered at other CF blogs, but I just had to share this. Mike Nimer has an <a href="http://www.mikenimer.com/index.cfm?mode=entry&entry=E1B111B9-4E22-1671-56DD1F9E8C7308BB">article</a> about a product that lets you wireframe Flex/Flash Form stuff in Visio. Darn nice stuff!</p>
