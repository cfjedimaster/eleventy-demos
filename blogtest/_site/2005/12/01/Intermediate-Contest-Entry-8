<p>Welcome to the eighth entry in the <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2005/10/30/Intermediate-ColdFusion-Contest">Intermediate ColdFusion Contest</a>. The earlier entries may be found at the end of this post. Today's entry is from Scott Johnson. Before reading on, please check his application <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/demos/contest2/sjohnson/bj/blackjack.cfm">here</a>. You can download his code from the download link at the bottom. Please respect the copyright of the creator.</p>

<p>Wow. I like Flash Forms - but I was amazed at this one. I was certain he was using a normal Flash file, but I noticed the loader looked just like a normal Flash Form. I opened up the code and saw that I was right - Flash Forms. Now - to be honest - he is pushing things a bit. He uses Flash Remoting and certainly that is the kind of thing that may not work in future versions of ColdFusion.</p>
<p>I am absolutely in love with this Flash Form - but due to the size - I'm going to suggest people download the zip and check out the file there. Not only does he use remoting, he employs some custom styles as well.</p>
<p>So with all that raving - now I'm going to nit pick. First off, his application.cfm file looks like so: (Note that I had to modify the appPath variable for my server.)</p>
<code>
&lt;cfapplication sessionmanagement="true" name="BlackJack"&gt;
<p>&lt;!--- PLayers starting amount of money is set ---&gt;
&lt;cfset APPLICATION.startAmount = 1000&gt;
&lt;!--- Set the path that the application resides in, with respect to the host ---&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;cfset APPLICATION.appPath = &quot;sjohnson.bj&quot;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;!--- if there is no blackjack cfc or if init variable is defined, create a new instance ---&gt;
&lt;cfif NOT IsDefined(&quot;SESSION.BlackJack&quot;) OR IsDefined(&quot;URL.init&quot;)&gt;
&lt;cfobject component=&quot;components.BlackJack&quot; name=&quot;SESSION.BlackJack&quot;&gt;
&lt;!--- initialize the cfc ---&gt;
&lt;cfset SESSION.BlackJack.Init()&gt;
&lt;/cfif&gt;
</code></p>
<p>He correctly caches his session variable, but doesn't do the same for his application variables. Therefore, every hit will recreate both startAmount and appPath in the Application scope. Not a horrible mistake - but something he should address.</p>
<p>Oh - and he didn't var scope. Getting tired of me saying that yet?</p>
<p>One last note. I had to modify the darn appPath variable everytime I moved the code. Can anyone think of a good way to create a &quot;dot&quot; path from the current folder?</p>
