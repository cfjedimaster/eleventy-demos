<p>I have a very minor bug fix for <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/projects/soundings">Soundings</a>, my ColdFusion survery application. The MySQL file used an unsigned int for the answes.rank property. For Matrix support, I was using negative numbers, and obviously these became positive in MySQL. I'd like to blame the NSA for this bug. And Microsoft.</p>
