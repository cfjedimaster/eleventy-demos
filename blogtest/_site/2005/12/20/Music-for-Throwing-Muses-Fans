<p>I've always been a big fan of Throwing Muses, so it was quite a delight to here a track from the new band by Kristin Hersh on <a href="http://www.woxy.com">WOXY</a> a few days ago. (If you like alternative/indie music, WOXY is a gift from God.) I was even happier to find out that her new band, 50Footwave, has an entire EP for <b>free</b> download. You can find the tracks <a href="http://www.throwingmusic.com/freemusic/">here</a>. The tracks are pretty good I think and you can't beat the price.</p>
<p>Musically I haven't heard much lately that has impressed me. The new <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&tag=raymondcamden-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=tg%2Fdetail%2F-%2FB000B2YQX4%2Fqid%3D1135098249%2Fsr%3D2-1%2Fref%3Dpd_bbs_b_2_1%3Fv%3Dglance%2526s%3Dmusic">Depeche Mode CD</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=raymondcamden-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> is... ok... but it is unfortunate that no other track comes even close to &quot;Precious&quot;. When I heard that I thought I was in for a return of the &quot;old&quot; Depeche Mode, but it wasn't to be.</p>
<p>I'm not a big drum and bass fan, but a friend sent me <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&tag=raymondcamden-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=tg%2Fdetail%2F-%2FB0009Y33BK%2Fqid%3D1135098311%2Fsr%3D2-1%2Fref%3Dpd_bbs_b_2_1%3Fv%3Dglance%2526s%3Dmusic">Pendulum</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=raymondcamden-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> - and that is quite nice. If you have even a passing interest in drum and base, I'd check it out.</p>
