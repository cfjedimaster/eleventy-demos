<p>Know Flash? Want to learn Flex? <a href="http://www.mindseye.com">Mindseye</a> is hiring. Best of all - you get to work on my team and hear me rant about source control and how much nicer ColdFusion is compared to .Net! Here is the job description:</p>
<p><b>Junior Flash/AS/Web Application</b><br>
Mindseye has an immediate opening for a Junior Flash/AS/Web Application
Developer to assist in the development and maintenance of websites and
flash-based applications.  You will be part of a talented,
cross-discipline development team.  You will work primarily from our
Boston office, which offers a casual yet hard-working atmosphere; some
telecommuting is okay.</p>
<p>You must be quick on your feet and able to learn new technologies on the
job. Knowledge of Flash/ActionScript, general web architecture, and one
or more of the following technologies is a must:</p>
<ul>
<li>ASP.NET (C#-based) and/or ASP
<li>Flex
<li>Java/JSP and/or JavaScript
<li>ColdFusion
<li>XML/XSLT
<li>DHTML
<li>CSS
</ul>
<p>This is a Flash postion - but you will be learning Flex. If you already
know Flex, it will be a definite plus.</p>
<p>Mindseye offers a generous benefits package, including fully paid health
insurance, dental, 401(k), 3-weeks vacation and 10 paid holidays. Our
office is conveniently located just minutes from South Station in
Boston, where the Red Line and Commuter Rail converge.</p>
<p>Interested candidates should forward their resume, salary requirements
and a code sample to hr@mindseye.com. First consideration will be given
to those applicants who include all the requested information.</p>
