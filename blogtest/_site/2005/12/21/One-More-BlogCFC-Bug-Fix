<p>So - it wouldn't be a new day without a new BlogCFC fix, right? Sorry folks, I guess this is the world of open source/freeware. ;) This bug involved the offset feature, which <i>sounds</i> like a minor feature, but has been a royal pain in my side since I added it. (I use it here as well since my server is in another timezone.) As always, you can download the zip from the <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/projects/blogcfc">project page</a>. If you got the fix yesterday, then just download this zip and copy the CFC only and you will be fine. If you aren't using the offset feature, feel free to ignore.</p>
<p>As an FYI, there is a <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/projects/lhp">Lighthouse Pro</a> update coming this week as well.</p>
