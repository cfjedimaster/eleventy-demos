<p>I'm happy to announce version 2 of <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/projects/lhp">Lighthouse Pro</a>, my ColdFusion Bug Tracking application. Changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Removal of Flash Forms. I love Flash Forms - but found that once I removed them, the application was a heck of a lot more zippier. I was also able to get a lot of things working that I couldn't do before.
<li>You can now create a user <i>and</i> subscribe them to projects as well. Before you could only assign them. You then had to ask them to logon and subscribe to ensure they got email notifications. It was a silly thing - but it is fixed now.
<li>Issues can have attachments. 
<li>Quick Stats added to home page.
</ul>
<p>Enjoy. Like most of my &quot;dot oh&quot; releases, I'm sure it has a few, um, issues with it. One thing I didn't get to add that I really want to is a search feature. This would let you search issues for keywords. Something else I didn't get around to is a print feature for multiple issues. This wasn't my idea but a user's suggestion. It allows you to quickly make a nice PDF of all the issues for a project. Anyway, that is just a glimpse of the future for LHP. Enjoy.</p>
<p>Happy New Year. In case folks are wondering why I'm not posting much - I'm off this week. I won't be back on a normal schedule till Tuesday.</p>
