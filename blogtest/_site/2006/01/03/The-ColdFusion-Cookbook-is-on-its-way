<p>A few days ago I <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2006/1/1/Coldfusion-MX7-Cookbook">posted</a> about the idea of having a ColdFusion cookbook. The response was overwhelmingly positive, so I have begun the project. I've purchased www.coldfusioncookbook.com (which doesn't point to anything yet) and have begun the initial development. My goal is to have something up by the end of the week.</p>
<p>So what if you want to submit content? I've got some very rough initial &quot;rules&quot; for how content entries should be submitted. Please note that this is, as I said, &quot;rough&quot; and may change later on.</p>
<ul>
<li>Every entry should be short and sweet. Remember the KISS rule. So this would be a good entry: "How do I send an entire form to an email address." and this would <b>not</b> be good: "How do I write good ColdFusion?"
<li>You can submit a question without an answer. 
<li>An answer should use camel case for CF functions/tags. The <b>first</b> time you mention a function/tag, you must link it to the livedocs reference page for the function/tag.
<li>If your entry is related to other entries, list the URLs.
</ul>
<p>That's it. This is very much a work in progress so forgive me if I completely change it later on.</p>
