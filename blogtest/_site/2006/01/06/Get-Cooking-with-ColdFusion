<h1>Post</h1>

<p>So, I warned you - and now it's here. I'm happy to announce the (Beta) launch of the <a href="http://www.coldfusioncookbook.com">ColdFusion Cookbook</a>. The site is <i>mostly</i> feature complete. We even have content! Thanks to <a href="http://www.brooks-bilson.com/blogs/rob/">Rob Brooks-Bilson</a> and <a href="http://www.petersenfam.com/jeremy/">Jeremy Petersen</a>. They have graciously donated content and given the site a great start.</p>
<p>Some points:</p>
<ul>
<li>The comments engine isn't ready. It's almost ready. I should have that up in a day or two.
<li>The PDF is ugly. Butt Ugly. Please help me. Any comments (or even code) would be greatly appreciated. Also - it is generated on demand. I already have a plan in mind on how to correct that. (And I'll blog it, since I think it is a good idea.)
<li><i>Any</i> other comments would be welcome as well.
</ul>}
