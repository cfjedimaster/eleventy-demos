<p>So hey - if you read my blog, you know I'm all teen-girl-crush over <a href="http://www.model-glue.com">Model-Glue</a>. If you want - you can actually <a href="http://clearsoftware.net/index.cfm?mode=entry&entry=A04826B0-E081-2BAC-695DDA41C15CE831">get a job</a> working with the guy who created it. Not only is he smart - he is a nice guy too - so this could be a great opportunity.</p>
