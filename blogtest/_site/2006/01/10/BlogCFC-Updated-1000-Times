<h1>Post</h1>

<p>Today marks a special occasion. No, I'm not talking about the <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2006/1/5/And-now-to-make-you-REALLY-hate-me">XBox360</a> (although I can't wait till the truck goes by), I'm talking about this blog. This is my 1000th entry. I've been blogging since February 12th, 2003. This site has generated five and a half thousand comments (and almost all of them were polite - no flame wars!). It has been fun - and very educational. The people posting comments have taught me probably far more than I've helped others - and to me - that certainly makes the time worthwhile.</p>
<p>Ok - so I'm not going to waste this entry being sentimental. I'm also releasing a minor <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/projects/blogcfc">BlogCFC</a> update. This update corrects (yet another) offset bug, updates the trackback spam list, and removes a line left in for debugging purposes. Enjoy! (As always, you can download the application from the <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/projects/blogcfc">project page</a>.)</p>
