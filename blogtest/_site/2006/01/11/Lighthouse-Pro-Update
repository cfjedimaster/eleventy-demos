<p>This update has some nice updates, but since I forgot to change the version number, it is still 2.0 (grin). What is new?</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for keyword filtering of issues.
<li>Syntax error fix in project loci edit.
<li>When doing stats for a project, we only show loci that apply to the project.
<li>Issue View - When editing a new issue, the header wasn't right. Also URL encode attachments. Default bug owner to current user when creating a new issue.
<li>Allow usernames with dots in them.
</ul>
<p>Last but not least - Robert Everland III has added a modified version of LHP. This may be found in the unsupported folder. It is a bit behind this zip, but offers support for MX 6.1 and Oracle.</p>
<p>As always, you can find the download at the <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/projects/lhp">project page</a> and my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/registry/2TCL1D08EZEYE">wishlist</a> is available for those who want to show their support. (Wow, where did all those XBox 360 items come from??)</p>
