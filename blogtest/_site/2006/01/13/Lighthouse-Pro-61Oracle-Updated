<h1>Post</h1>

<p>Robert Everland has updated his LHP 6.1/Oracle mod to match the <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2006/1/11/Lighthouse-Pro-Update">latest release</a> of the core product. As a reminder - I do not QA/support these mods, so I can't promise it will work. I'm sure it can't be any more buggy then my normal code, so you should be safe. Today's build was brought to you  by the Pixies and the Breeders (currently in my iTunes playlist).</p>
<p>You can download the zip from the <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/projects/lhp">project page</a>. Those running the main version of LHP need not download.</p>
