How to use AJAX with Coldfusion?

<p>As is normally the case with ColdFusion, there are multiple answers....</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mindseye.com">We</a> had to find an AJAX solution a few months ago for one of our clients. A coworker did some research and found
the <a href="http://www.indiankey.com/cfajax/release/1-2.asp">CFAjax</a> project. While I was only marginally involved with the code, it did seem to work ok.</p>
<p>Another project to consider is the <a href="http://www.robgonda.com/blog/projects/ajaxcfc">ajaxCFC</a> project by <a href="http://www.robgonda.com/blog/">Rob Gonda</a>. I haven't had a chance to play with this one yet, but I like the feature list, and it integrates with <a href="http://www.model-glue.com">Model-Glue</a>, which is always a plus.</p>
<p>If any of my readers have other projects they use, please comment below.</p>
