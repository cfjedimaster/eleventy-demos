<h1>Post</h1>

<p>My readers know by now that I'm trully smitten by <a href="http://www.model-glue.com">Model-Glue</a>, so I try to push/evangelize it whenever I can. I thought I'd share some MG code to see if it would help others. The <a href="http://www.coldfusioncookbook.com">ColdFusion Cookbook</a> site is a MG site and I've attached the source to this entry.</p>
<p>Now - I don't want you to think I'm being humble - but please remember that I'm still a newbie at MG. This is only my second MG site, and it was written <i>very</i> quickly since I wanted to launch the cookbook site as fast as possible. This code example is <b>not</b> best practices. I think I still have a lot to learn about MG. But my hope is that this code will give others some more examples from which to learn MG. (And hey - Joe, Doug, Sean, feel free to rip me a new one on my comments. I want to learn as well! :)</p>
<p>p.s. I forgot to mention. This is the complete source code <i>except</i> for the removal of the serial code for the Captcha component, and I removed my admin authentication code.<p><a href='enclosures/D%3A%5Cwebsites%5Ccamdenfamily%5Csource%5Cmorpheus%5Cblog%5Cenclosures%2Fcookbook%2Ezip'>Download attached file.</a></p></p>
