<h1>Post</h1>

<p>Time for another update. This week it is brought to you by the mashup mp3 of 50 Cent and NIN. Sweet. Anyway, what is new in 4.0.3?</p>
<ul>
<li>A license! Woohoo! The feature everyone has been asking for!
<li>When you add a comment, we validate your URL.
<li>You can now disable comments on a post that has comments. Instead of hiding the comments, they will still be displayed, you just can't add anymore. 
<li>Added nofollow to various links here and there.
<li>If a comment is blocked by the spam checker, don't send the email.
<li>New TB spam words. Thanks spammers!
<li>XML fixes to RSS generation. (Thanks Paul Hastings!)
<li>Stats updates. (Thanks Rob Brooks-Bilson!)
</ul>
<p>As always, you can download BlogCFC from the <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/projects/blogcfc">project page</a>. As always, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/registry/2TCL1D08EZEYE">wishlist</a> purchases are welcome. (And to the person who picked up the Nano.... wow... I owe you a feature of two. :)</p>
