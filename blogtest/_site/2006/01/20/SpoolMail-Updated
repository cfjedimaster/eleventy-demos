<p>I made two minor updates to <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/projects/spoolmail">SpoolMail</a>. First off - I got rid of the Application.cfc file and changed it to a Application.cfm file provided by Phillip Duba. Now - let me be clear. Application.cfc is <i>much</i> better than Application.cfm. But since this was the only thing preventing the application from working in CFMX6 (and 5 most likely), it seemed like a good call.</p>
<p>Secondly, I added the <a href="http://www.cflib.org/udf.cfm/activateurl">ActivateURL</a> UDF to the message display. This will auto-hot link any URL/email address. These links should pop open a new window.</p>
<p>Oh - and I added a license. If you have any questions on the license, just let me know. You can download the application from the <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/projects/spoolmail">project page</a>.</p>
