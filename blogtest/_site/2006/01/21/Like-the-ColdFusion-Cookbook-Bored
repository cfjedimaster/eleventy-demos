<p>Do you like the <a href="http://www.coldfusioncookbook.com">ColdFusion Cookbook</a> site? Are you bored to tears and want something only marginally less boring to do?</p>
<p>Today I added a cool feature to the Cookbook. (Added it locally I mean.) The new feature will scan cookbook answers for CFML functions and tags. When it finds it, it will automatically hot link to live docs. It will also add a new section called &quot;Referenced CFML&quot; (or some such) with an alphabetical list of tags/functions (again, hyperlinked).</p>
<p>To drive this, though, I need a static list of functions and tags. I'm driving this through XML now. Here is what I have so far:</p>
<code>
&lt;cfml&gt;
&lt;functions&gt;
&lt;function label="createUUID()" url="http://livedocs.macromedia.com/coldfusion/7/htmldocs/00000436.htm##1102827" /&gt;
&lt;/functions&gt;
&lt;/cfml&gt;
</code>
<p>As you can see, each function has a label and a url. The label is in the camel case I prefer. Obviouslly tags will be in a tags/tag section.</p>
<p>So what do I need? If you are incredibly bored, go to the pages in livedocs that list out all the functions and all the tags, and create the XML for them.</p>
<p>I know - you need to be crazy bored to do this - but I figure it can't hurt to ask. If you want to do this, please post a comment. Something like, &quot;I'll do all functions, A-C&quot;. That way people won't duplicate the work. Be sure to copy the link on the <i>listing</i> page. I believe the URL you see <i>on</i> the page itself won't work due to the fancy JS stuff they have there. (I really wish they would go back to &quot;simple&quot; pages. Ever since the fancy JS stuff was added the site seems a bit... wierd at times. Although I'd keep the comments in.) Anyway, everything clear? Let me know if not. I <i>will</i> give credit to my submitters. That won't buy you much, but you can at least say you helped build the site. :)</p>
