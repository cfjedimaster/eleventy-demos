<h1>Post</h1>

<p>Today I added what I think is a pretty cool feature to the <a href="http://www.coldfusioncookbook.com">ColdFusion Cookbook</a>. Now all (most) CFML tags and functions will be auto-linked to the livedocs documentation for that tag or function. Since it is XML-based, whenever Adobe gets around to finally adding getSessions (come on already, it's time! :) I can simply modify the source XML file.</p>
<p>Of course, I didn't sit there and copy over all the URLs myself. I want to thank the following people for helping out:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jim Collins
<li>Scotty Scott (now <i>that</i> is a cool name)
<li>Rob Gonda
</ul>}
