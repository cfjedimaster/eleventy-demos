<p>So, it is <i>very</i> short notice, but I will be in Boston next week and will be speaking at the Boston CFUG.</p>
<p>The meeting will be held on Friday the 3rd of February. The meeting will be held in a conference room at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, 600 Atlantic Ave. (4th floor) directly across the street from South Station. It will begin at 6:30.</p>
<p>The building owners are asking that I supply a list to ease security into the building, so RSVP's should be emailed to brinaldi@remotesynthesis.com (additional people can show up, but they said having a list can simplify things for security).</p>
<p>Brian also asks that you email him some topic ideas - otherwise I'll spend the time talking about Star Wars.</p>
<p>I'll bring along some books for a give away as well. (Which should be safe unless the airline loses my luggage.... again.)</p>
