<h1>Post</h1>

<p>A few minor updates to <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/projects/lhp">Lighthouse Pro</a> have been released this morning:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can now do a Print All from the project page. This will either print all issues, or print the ones currently selected in a filter. This is handy for times when you want to generate a report of an entire project's issues. This idea cam from <a href="http://www.alagad.com">Doug Hughes</a>.
<li>Sort by severity works now. I do plan on making severities editable in the near future.
<li>Few small typo fixes and a PDF version of the documentation is included.
<li>Oh yeah, it has a license now. (sigh)
</ul>
<p>As always, you can download the application from the <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/projects/lhp">project page</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/registry/2TCL1D08EZEYE">donations</a> are appreciated.</p>
<p><i>Today's build brought to you by Public Enemy and the Pixies.</i></p>
