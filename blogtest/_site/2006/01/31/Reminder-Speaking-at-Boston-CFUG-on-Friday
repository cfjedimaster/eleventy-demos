<p>Just a reminder - but I will be speaking at the Bustom CFUG this week on Friday.</p>
<p>From my last post....</p>
<p>The meeting will be held on Friday the 3rd of February. The meeting will be held in a conference room at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, 600 Atlantic Ave. (4th floor) directly across the street from South Station. It will begin at 6:30.</p>
<p>The building owners are asking that I supply a list to ease security into the building, so RSVP's should be emailed to brinaldi@remotesynthesis.com (additional people can show up, but they said having a list can simplify things for security).</p>
