<p>The last two times I've rebooted my machine, I've gotten an odd error from Norton AntiVirus:</p>
<p>Norton AntiVirus 2005 does not support the repair feature...</p>
<p>Turns out - and pinch me because I must be dreaming - but the error occurred because I dared to move my <a href="http://service1.symantec.com/SUPPORT/nav.nsf/docid/2004090712504306?OpenDocument&ExpandSection=1&Src=hot#_Section1">short cuts</a>. Am I wrong or is it insane for a program to throw an error because it can't find shortcuts? Is this some security check? Are there viruses that attack Norton by moving the shortcuts? I can see that as a valid way to attack a system, but the program can't handle it a bit nicer?</p>
