<p>Just as a warning - this entry has some spoilers. So - tonight's episode was  a bit low on plot. It was a good episode, don't get me wrong, anything with Sawyer is pretty good, but as for the general &quot;What the hell is going on&quot; plot nothing much happened, however, here are a few random notes:</p>
<p>I didn't think much of Hurley's comment about time travel. I don't know why - but time travel would just be so trivial. It would also be pretty evident. Before the old song played, we heard a DJ (in French I think), and I'm sure it would be evident from what he says if the broadcast was from another time.</p>
<p>As I mentioned in my <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2006/1/26/LOST-Review-for-125-Spoilers">last review</a>, Charlie is definitely slipping to the dark side. We saw in the preview for next week that one of the Other's get captured. Watch Charlie get pretty friendly with him.</p>
<p>Speaking of next week - we finally get to see what happens when the timer hits zero. All I can say is - about time.</p>
<p>I spoke to someone on IRC this week who said that, supposedly, the black smoke is in every episode, did anyone see it this week? How about any other secrets?</p>
