<p>So, I know I'm late to the party, but this <a href="http://www.skype.com">Skype</a> thing is pretty darn cool. I used it for the first time yesterday. I did an interview with two people. All three of us were in different locations. To be honest - it sounded <i>better</i> than my phone. I'd even say it sounded better than Breeze, but to be fair, Breeze is doing a lot more at once. I haven't tried the video conferencing yet, but so far, this is the best darn little application I've used in a while.</p>
<p>Stephen Collins, of Acme fame, is hosting a <a href="http://www.stephencollins.org/cfskypecommunity-optintrue/">list</a> of ColdFusion Skype users.</p>
<p>(And let me go off topic and remind folks of the <a href="http://www.stephencollins.org/acme/">ACME Guide</a> - the single best PDF on the planet. Seriously.)</p>
