<p>Saw this on a <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory?id=1602666&CMP=OTC-RSSFeeds0312">story</a> at ABC News this morning:</p>
<blockquote>
The White House has barred some top advisers and staffers from answering Senate investigators' questions about the administration's response, saying that certain discussions and documents must remain confidential.
</blockquote>
<p>Am I the only one saying, &quot;What the heck&quot; at this? A disaster response is confidential? <a href="http://www.boyzoid.com">Scott</a> made the comment that maybe the thinking was that if a terrorist knew how we responded to disaster they can use it against us... but like him, I think this is just the administration covering their rears.</p>
