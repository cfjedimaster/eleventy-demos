<h1>Post</h1>

<p>I just wanted to send out a quick (and public) thank you to Jake over at <a href="http://www.blogfusion.com/index.cfm?commentID=2">BlogFusion</a>. If you don't know about BlogFusion, it is another ColdFusion-based blog. Technically, my competition - but Jake has been very cool with sharing some code with me that will also make <i>my</i> blog better as well. I think both of our new releases will be great and offer some nice tools for the entire community, which to be honest is why we really do this anyway. (I hope Jake doesn't mind me talking for him. ;)</p>
