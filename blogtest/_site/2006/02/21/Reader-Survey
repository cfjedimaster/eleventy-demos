<h1>Post</h1>

<p>I had meant to do this earlier in the year, but better late than never. If you are a reader of this blog (or even if not), I'd love it if you could take the time to fill out a short <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/poll.cfm">survey</a>. I just want to get a good feel for how people are using the blog, if it is useful, what they want to see more (or less) of, etc. Consider it a good chance to yell at me for taking so long to get the Advanced Contest up. ;)</p>
