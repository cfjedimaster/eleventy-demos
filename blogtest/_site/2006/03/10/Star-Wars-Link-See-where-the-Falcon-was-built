<p>My good buddy sent me this <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/south_west/4555455.stm">story</a> from the BBC. It talks about the company that built the Millennium Falcon for the original Star Wars films. The absolute coolest thing about the story? It says that that ship could actually hover (just a few millimeters) so that it could be moved without wheels. I wonder where this ship is now?</p>
