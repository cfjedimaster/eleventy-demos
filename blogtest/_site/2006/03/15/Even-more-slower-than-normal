<p>I had to fly on Monday and Tuesday this week for a family issue (nothing to worry about), so I may be slower than normal to respond this week. For some reason, I seemed to get about a hundred bug reports on my apps, and about a hundred Ask a Jedi questions, so forgive me if it takes me a while to catch up.</p>
