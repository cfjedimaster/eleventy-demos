<p>Just in case you missed it, there is now <a href="http://labs.macromedia.com/wiki/index.php/ColdFusion/Flex_Connectivity:Eclipse_RDS_Support">RDS</a> support in Eclipse. This was the last nail in the coffin for HomeSite+ for me. I've actually been using it for a while now and it works great. It was especially useful in updating the trackback spam list for my blog remotely. (Which I've now just turned off. Thanks spammers.) The dataview is also really darn handy. I tend to easily forget column names and stuff like that, so having it available in Eclipse has been extremely helpful.</p>
