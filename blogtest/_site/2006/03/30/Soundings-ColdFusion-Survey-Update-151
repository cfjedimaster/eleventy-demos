<h1>Post</h1>

<p>I've released an update to <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/projects/soundings">Soundings</a> today. Soundings is my ColdFusion survey application. It lets you create surveys and gather results. You can generate reports on these surveys as well.</p>
<p>The update has <i>more</i> bug fixes on the tableprefix feature. Nathan, I hope your happy. ;) I want to give <b>big thanks</b> to Ryan Heldt. He sent me a nice list of the tableprefix bugs along with actual line numbers. This made it super easy to update the code base.</p>
<p>So why did I update the version number? I actually added a feature. A request came in a week or so ago that made such perfect sense I'm not sure why I never had it in the first place. You can now clear the results of a survey. This lets you build the survey, test it, and then clear the results before going live.</p>
<p>As always, you can download the code from the <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/projects/soundings">project page</a>.</p>
<p>p.s. Hey Scott, look, I didn't mention my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/registry/2TCL1D08EZEYE">wishlist</a> once! Oops...</p>
