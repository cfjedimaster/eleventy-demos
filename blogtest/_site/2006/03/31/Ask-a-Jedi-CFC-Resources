<p>Abhishek (I get a lot of cool names for some reason) wanted to know about CFCs:</p>
<blockquote>
I am working as a coldfusion developer since version 5.0, i am not very much familiar with CFC, can u please suggest me that how can get mastery in CFCs. 
</blockquote>
<p>I've written about CFCs here in the past, and there are various resources out there. I've added a new link to my guides pod (top right) for a <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/cfcresources.cfm">CFC Resources</a> list. I hope this helps. If you have ideas for others links, post them here and I'll add them to the list.</p>
<p>I also wonder - how many of my readers are still using CF5? And why?</p>
