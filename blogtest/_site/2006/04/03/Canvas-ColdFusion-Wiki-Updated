<h1>Post</h1>

<p>Don't ask me why, but I released <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/projects/canvas">Canvas ColdFusion Wiki</a> without a very simple, very necessary feature - email on change. If you specify the setting in the config file, any change to the wiki will result in an email sent to you. The email format is not great - so please send me feedback on how to clean it (if you think it does).</p>
<p>As always, you can download the application from the <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/projects/canvas">project page</a>.</p>
<p>p.s. Today's build was not brought to you by too-loud trance music, but rather the smooth sounds of the guys over at the <a href="http://www.coldfusionpodcast.com">ColdFusion Podcast</a>.</p>
