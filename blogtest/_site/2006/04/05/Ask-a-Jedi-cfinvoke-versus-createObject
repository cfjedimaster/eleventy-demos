<p>So I could have sworn I had blogged on this before, but I couldn't find it in my archives, so here goes. (And if I do start repeating myself, let me know folks!)</p>
<blockquote>
Is there a reason to favor cfinvoke over cfobject? Does cfinvoke clean up after itself faster?
</blockquote>
<p>Technically you are comparing apples and oranges. The cfobject tag (and createObject function) are meant to create an instance of a CFC. The cfinvoke tag runs a method on a CFC. You can use createObject to both create a CFC and run a method:</p>
<code>
&lt;cfset foo = createObject("component", "president").init(42)&gt;
</code>
<p>But the same could be done with cfinvoke.</p>
<code>
&lt;cfinvoke component="president" method="init" id="42" returnVariable="foo"&gt;
</code>
<p>I think you will find it comes down to a style issue.</p>
