<h1>Post</h1>

<p>So it's been quite a long time since the last release of BlogCFC. I've finally started development of version 5. Last night I started on the administrator. The blog uses what is called &quot;designmode&quot; to allow you to edit on the page. This was based off Spectra (may it rest in peace). While this is handy for simply popping up a window and writing a quick article, it really isn't great for administration. As my blog has grown, I've really felt constrained by the decision to not have a &quot;real&quot; admin and now I'm finally doing something about it.</p>
<p>So far I've got comment editing (and deleting), category editing, and subscriber editing working. All things that are not in the current release. (Category editing is, but it's not terribly nice I think.)</p>
<p>Along with administration work, I added a new property to blog entries - views. A view is added anytime a person views a particular blog entry - not including reading the entry on the home page. You can see this on my blog in the <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/stats.cfm#topviews">stats</a> portion. The numbers are a bit low since I only turned it on this morning. This change will also let me show what categories are most popular.</p>
<p>While I'm working on the admin and other behind the scenes stuff, Scott Stroz (Boyzoid) is working on the front end. The goal is to get to a pure CSS layout for BlogCFC, and to simply make it a bit prettier. Simple things like a background color and centering the blog make it look quite a bit nicer. I've also had other a few other people offer to submit their CSS changes, so I will be passing that to Scott to integrate.</p>
<p>Other changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>XML-RPC: From Jake. This will let you write blog entries completely outside of the web site.
<li>Send to a Friend: This is an obvious feature that I should have added a long time ago. Once again it wasn't my idea, but suggested by a friend.
<li>Related Entries: Written by Jeff and CJ. I've had the code for a while now, just haven't had a time to integrate it.
<li>I'm considering a few ways to make it easier to add images to a post. I don't want a HTML editor - but maybe a way to automatically include a picture if it is attached to the entry as an enclosure. 
</ul>
<p>So - there is a lot left to do. The good news is that I'm now using SVN. Once it gets to a stable alpha, I'll open it up for folks to download from and play.</p>
