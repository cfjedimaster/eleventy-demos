<h1>Post</h1>

<p>So, I know I don't post many off topics entries here (was that lightning I just heard?) but today is a very special day - my wedding anniversary. Normally I wouldn't bother sharing, but I'm proud to say my wife and I hit the ten year mark today.</p>
<p>If you are a reader of this blog or a user of any of my <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/projects/projects.cfm">projects</a>, you should say a quick thank you to my wife. Without her <i>constant</i> support I would not be where I am today. Along with love and support, she is a darn good judge about what makes sense (both on and off the web) and I often run ideas by her first for a &quot;sanity&quot; check.</p>
