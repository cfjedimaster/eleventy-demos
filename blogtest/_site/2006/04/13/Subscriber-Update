<h1>Post</h1>

<p>First off - sorry for all the entries today. I'm actually super busy, so I don't know how I even found the time. I just announced <a href="http://www.blogcfc.com">BlogCFC.com</a> and posted a few entries there on the new BlogCFC. What I didn't realize is that the database for this new blog had been copied from this blog, and therefore had all my subscribers on it. (Well, not all, it was a copy from about two months ago.)</p>
<p>Anyway, I have removed <i>everyone</i> from that blog, and I apologize for all the emails you just got from me on that blog. Obviously you can sign up there if you want to track progress on BlogCFC5.</p>
