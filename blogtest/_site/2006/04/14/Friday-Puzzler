<p>I thought the last puzzler was kind of fun, so I figured why not do it again. I'm not around much today to comment on the entries, but if you are bored, here is a small coding challenge: Madlibs. Your code will take a hard coded string like so:</p>
<blockquote>
Four score and {number} years ago,<br/>
Star Wars was a {adjective} movie.<br/>
I saw it with two hundred {plural noun}.<br/>
I need a new {noun} like I need a new {noun} in my head.
</blockquote>
<p>It will look for any tokens inside { } characters, and create a simple form where the value inside the {} token is the label for the text field. In other words, the string above would have made a form with three text fields, labelled number, adjective, and plural noun. When the user hits submit, the values for each form field will replace the tokens in the original string.</p>
<p>Nice and simple, right? Don't even bother with validation. Just parse the string, create the form, and then display the madlib based on the user's input.</p>
<p>As a reminder, this is <i>not</i> a contest. There are no prizes. If you spend more than five minutes on it, walk away from your computer. Enjoy.</p>
