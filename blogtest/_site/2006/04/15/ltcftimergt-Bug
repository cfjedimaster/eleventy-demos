<p>I ran into a little bug today with <a href="http://www.techfeed.net/cfQuickDocs/?cftimer">cftimer</a>. I was using the inline mode which is supposed to report the time right where the code was ran. However, nothing showed up.</p>
<p>On a whim, I turned of the enablecfoutputonly setting and it started working. I turned it back on, wrapped cftimer in cfoutput tags, and it worked as well.</p>
<p>Turns out cftimer doesn't always output. Other tags, like cfdump, will always show their output, even if inside an enablecfoutputonly=true and no cfoutput tags. This makes sense if you think about it. Any cf tag that generates output should be treated just like a cfoutput block.</p>
<p>I reported the bug. Don't forget that you can report bugs as well. Just go here: <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/go/wish">http://www.macromedia.com/go/wish</a>. I can say from personal experience that Adobe <i>does</i> read the bug entries.</p>
