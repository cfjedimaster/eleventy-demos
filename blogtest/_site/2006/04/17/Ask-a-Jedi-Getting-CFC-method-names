<blockquote>
Is there a way to parse a list of methods from a .CFC into an array using introspection? I am creating a simple ajax form to do testing of .cfc methods, and I would like to auto-populate a drop down of available methods after the user enters a
component name.  I know I can &lt;cfobject&gt; the component and then dump it, but how would I reference the methods as variable's?
</blockquote>
<p>First off, to get the methods from a CFC instance you would use the <a href="http://www.techfeed.net/cfQuickDocs/?GetMetaData">getMetaData</a> function like so:</p>
<code>
&lt;cfset messageCFC = createObject("component", "forums.cfcs.message")&gt;
&lt;cfset methods = getMetaData(messageCFC).functions&gt;
&lt;cfdump var="#methods#"&gt;
</code>
<p>The getMetaData function will return a lot of information about the CFC, but note that I am just using the functions key. How could you then invoke a method dynamically? The <a href="http://www.techfeed.net/cfQuickDocs/?cfinvoke">cfinvoke</a> tag can be passed a dynamic name:</p>
<code>
&lt;cfinvoke component="messageCFC" method="#someMethod#"&gt;
</code>
<p>It would probably be a bit difficult to handle the arguments like this in a <i>truly</i> 100% dynamic fashion, but this should give you the basics for what you want to do.</p>
