<p>I've got a minor update to my ColdFusion based bug tracker, <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/projects/lhp">Lighthouse Pro</a>. The update corrects a bug reported this morning involving bad characters in the issue fields. I can't stand bad characters. They make me angry. And hungry. Hungry and angry and a little nervous.</p>
<p>Anyway, along with the bug fix I did add one cool feature that had been suggested by Edgar Garcia. In the left hand navigation, next to yours projects, there is a new link to add a bug. Now you don't have to enter a project and then click the Add Issue link. Smart!</p>
<p>As always, if you like the application, take a gander at my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/registry/2TCL1D08EZEYE">wish list</a> and show your support.</p>
