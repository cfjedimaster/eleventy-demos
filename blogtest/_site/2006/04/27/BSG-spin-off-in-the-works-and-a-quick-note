<p>A friend sent me a note saying that one of my favorite shows, Battlestar Galactica, will be getting a <a href="http://www.zap2it.com/tv/news/zap-scifi-galacticaprequel,0,6083698.story?coll=zap-news-headlines">spin off</a> series set about 50 years in the past from where BSG started. This could be good stuff. Personally I just want season three to start. The end of season two was absolutely amazing (and incredibly depressing).</p>
<p>Sorry for the lack of postings. I've been fighting a cough lately. While it's not the bad (I don't seem to have anything else but a cough), last night I ended up going to bed at like 7.</p>
