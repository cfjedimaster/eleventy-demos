<p>One of the (many) things I like about ColdFusion is its built-in support for charting. I especially like the improvements in the last version. Not just the ability to apply custom charting, but the simple improvement to the default colors. There <i>is</i> a reason I don't pick out my own clothes!</p>
<p>For today's puzzler though, we are going to take a trip back in time. Imagine for a moment that you don't have Flash based charts or even HTML for that matter. Imagine you have a set of data and you want to generate a simple bar chart. You are only allowed to use preformatted text since it is going to an old fashion line printer.</p>
<p>Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to create a textbased bar chart based on the data from the code at the end of this entry. You can use * for bar markers, or any character. You don't have to do labels, but it's extra credit if you do. (You will win 5% more than the nothing I'm giving away.)</p>
<p>As always, remember the rules: Don't spend more than five minutes and don't expect a prize. It's just for fun.</p>

&lt;!--- Sales of widgets over the last 12 months ---&gt;
&lt;cfset sales = arrayNew(1)&gt;
&lt;cfloop index="x" from="1" to="12"&gt;
	&lt;cfset sales[x] = randRange(0,100)&gt;
&lt;/cfloop&gt;

<p>p.s. Still coughing, but I think I'm slowly getting over whatever bug got me this week. What really bugs me is sinus issues always tends to make beer takes like crap.</p>
