<p>I think this has been out for a while now but I never got around to updating my sig. Team Macromedia is now Adobe Community Experts. In other words, I'm now an Ace, which sounds a heck of a lot like a fighter pilot call sign, which is fine by me. When I started off in this program it was Team Allaire, so this is the second name change I've been through.</p>
<p>I think the program, and Allaire/Macromedia/Adobe's support of it, is a darn good thing. Everyone in the program is a volunteer and we are not paid to push the products. I've been known to complain even (once or twice of course) about ColdFusion, so while we may be biased, we are not drones.</p>
<p>Take some time and peruse the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/communities/experts/">list</a> of ACE members. Each member is designated with the technology that he or she is an expert in. (I need to get Flex2 added to my list soon!)</p>
<p>One thing you will notice right away is that one you go to a member, the titles revert back to Team Macromedia, but I'm sure that will be fixed soon.</p>
<p>My <a href="http://www.adobe.com/support/forums/team_macromedia/team_members/149.html">bio</a> is quite old (in more ways then one) and will hopefully be updated this week.<p><a href='enclosures/D%3A%5Cwebsites%5Ccamdenfamily%5Csource%5Cmorpheus%5Cblog%5Cenclosures%2Face%5Flogo%2Egif'>Download attached file.</a></p></p>
