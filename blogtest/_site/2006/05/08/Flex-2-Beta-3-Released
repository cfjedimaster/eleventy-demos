<p>Ok, everyone and their mother is talking about it, but just so you know, the 3rd beta of Flex 2 is now up on <a href="http://labs.adobe.com">Labs</a>. I've talked a bit about Flex 2 in the past, and I hope to bring it up here more and more as I get more comfortable with it. I <i>really</i> think Flex 2 is the bees knees, and here is a good example:</p>
<blockquote>
<a href="http://www.cflib.org/cflibflex/output/CFlib.html">http://www.cflib.org/cflibflex/output/CFlib.html</a>
</blockquote>
<p>Ok, so it's ugly. I'm not a designer. But what you see is a) much more responsive than the &quot;real&quot; site (<a href="http://www.cflib.org">www.cflib.org</a>) and b) represents just 30 minutes or work.</p>
<p>In other words - I built something that <i>dramatically</i> improved the usefulness of my site in about half an hour.</p>
<p>Now obviously this needs some polish. There is no search. There is no &quot;click here to copy&quot;. All of these would help the application even more. But what really gets me is the RAD aspect. I've always loved how a good ColdFusion developer can produce amazing results in little time. The addition of Flex 2 is a perfect companion to the use of ColdFusion on the back end. You've got back end RAD and front end RAD. As I said - it's the bees knees.</p>
<p>p.s. Tomorrow when I'm not so busy I'll actually post the code to this so you can see how little work it was.</p>
