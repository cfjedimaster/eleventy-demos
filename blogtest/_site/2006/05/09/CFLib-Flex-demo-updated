<p>Last night I <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2006/5/8/Flex-2-Beta-3-Released">blogged</a> about the release of Flex 2 Beta 3 and linked to a demo I built that interfaces with CFLib. I refreshed the demo today and added the viewSource property. You can find the demo here:</p>

<p>To see the source, all you have to do is right click and select View Source. I had trouble with Flex Builder 2's default support for viewing source, so I simply use the &quot;link to a URL&quot; option. So what you see is <i>not</i> the best way to get the source. I'll try to get that working soon.</p>
<p>I also added a tiny bit of style to the application, but obviously I'm no designer. Also - be very clear on one thing when you look at the source - I am very much a Flex2 newbie. I'm sure my code is far from best practice. The CFC I wrote was also a quick job and I would have done it a bit differently if I were building it &quot;for real.&quot;</p>
