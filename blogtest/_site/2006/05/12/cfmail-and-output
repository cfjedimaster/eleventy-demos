<p>A week or so ago I had an odd error report on the BlogCFC beta. A user had errors using the Send() function on a CFMX 6.1 box, but not 7. The error was a null pointer exception (npe), which are notorious for being hard to debug. (For me anyway.) The error was occurring inside cfmail tags where I rendered the body of the entry. For the life of me I couldn't figure out what was going wrong... until I noticed that I had used cfoutput tags.</p>
<p>You aren't supposed to need cfoutput tags inside a cfmail tag since the cfmail acts like a cfoutput. So this is fine:</p>
<code>
&lt;cfmail ...&gt;
#x#
&lt;/cfmail&gt;
</code>
<p>In fact, earlier in the email I had done exactly that. I had simply forgotte and used cfoutput tags.</p>
<p>What made this odd is that CFMX 7 had no problem with the code at all. It ran just fine. Only CFMX 6.1 threw the NPE. Anyone know why? I'm sure it's something simple.</p>
<p>For those who want to test, this is a simple script I used in both 6.1 and 7:</p>
<code>
&lt;cfmail to="whoever@localhost.com"  from="whover@localhost.com" subject="oops"&gt;
&lt;cfoutput&gt;foo&lt;/cfoutput&gt;
&lt;/cfmail&gt;
</code>
<p>p.s. Guess which popular blogging application will be shipping later today?</p>
