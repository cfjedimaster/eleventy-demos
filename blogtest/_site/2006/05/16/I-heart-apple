<p>So yesterday I picked up the MacBook Pro. I did this even though I had heard that the consumer edition (the MacBook) was being released today. It was my assumption that the MBPro wouldn't change. Well, imagine my surprise when I discovered that they upped the default CPU with the 15 inch MBPro. What I had ordered 24 hours ago was now 300 dollars cheaper.</p>
<p>I prepared myself for a tough call with customer service. I figured they would not let me cancel my order without a fight, but I figured if worse comes to worse, I'd go to my credit card company and stop the payment.</p>
<p>On a whim I quickly checked the order status for my purchase yesterday and immediately noticed that my line item had been replaced. My order was now 300 dollars cheaper.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>I wonder if Dell would do that?</p>
