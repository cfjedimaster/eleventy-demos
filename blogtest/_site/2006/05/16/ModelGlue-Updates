<p>Joe has released a new update to <a href="http://www.model-glue.com">Model-Glue</a>. This is a release candidate for MG 1.1.10. As it is not final, you may not want to run it on a production site, but the <a href="http://www.coldfusioncookbook.com">ColdFusion Cookbook</a> is running an earlier version of it just fine. I'll update it a bit later this week. As Joe describes in his <a href="http://www.model-glue.com/index.cfm?mode=entry&entry=3A45A30C-E081-2BAC-69C0762A5EB63B63">blog entry</a>, there are some pretty significant performance increases in this version.</p>
