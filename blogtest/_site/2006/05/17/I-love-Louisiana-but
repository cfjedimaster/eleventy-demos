<p>You have to admit that any state that <a href="http://www.katc.com/Global/story.asp?S=4913975&Call=Email&Format=HTML">can't  ban cock fighting</a> has some serious issues. I'm no PETA lover and I certainly eat meat, but I don't think you need to be a tree hugger to think this &quot;sport&quot; is just disgusting. I think they should hold a &quot;match&quot; at the state legislature. Make it nice and clear exactly how disgusting this activity is. Make the guys who support this say so while the match is on in front of the news cameras.</p>
