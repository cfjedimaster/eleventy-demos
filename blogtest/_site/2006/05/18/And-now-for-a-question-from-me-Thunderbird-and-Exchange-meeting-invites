<p>So here is an interesting question. I use Thunderbird as my email client since Outlook tends to get &quot;icky&quot; when you have a few too many emails. While Thunderbird has it's own quirks, I've gotten quite used to it and will never switch back to Outlook.</p>
<p>However - I've run into a little problem. At my new <a href="http://www.roundpeg.com">job</a>, most folks use Outlook and they send meeting invites via email. Thunderbird simply doesn't know what to do witht his.</p>
<p>I have been able to save the ICS attachment and import it into Google Calendar. While this adds the event, it doesn't let me accept the meeting.</p>
<p>Any ideas? If worse comes to worse, I guess I can reinstall Outlook and simply tell Thunderbird to have Outlook be the application for ICS files, but there must be a simpler way to handle this.</p>
<p>p.s. The MacBook Pro has shipped. It is currently in China which means it will get here in Lafayette sometime this fall.
