<p>Aaron West of the <a href="http://www.ncfug.com/">Nashville ColdFusion User Group</a> has asked me to present next week at their meeting. This will be over Breeze, so it is open to folks not in the Nashville area as well. Details may be found <a href="http://www.ncfug.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=dspMeetingInfo">here</a>.</p>
<p>I'll be presenting on <a href="http://www.model-glue.com">Model-Glue</a>, which I <i>still</i> feel like I'm a newbie on, but I definitely have some thoughts on the framework and plan on spending a lot of time just sharing the Model-Glue code I've written so far. As folks know, I'm somewhat of a zealot for the Model-Glue (insert glue sniffing joke here), so hopefully I can bring a few new converts to the fold.</p>
