<p>I know I said I'd keep most blog news to <a href="http://www.blogcfc.com">www.blogcfc.com</a>, but I wanted to point out that the latest updates had an important security fix. Thanks to <a href="http://www.petefreitag.com/">Pete Freitag</a> for finding this. Subversionw as updated already, but this morning I also updated the main download zip to 5.003 as well. As always, you can find the download on the <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/projects/blogcfc">project page</a>.</p>
