<p>Today's contest is not only simple, but (hopefully) useful. Write a UDF that will take a string of CFML code as input. The UDF will parse the string for CFML tags. It will then return a  result set that includes each tag used (without arguments) and the number of times it is used. This could create a report that looks like so:</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td>&lt;cfset&gt;</td>
<td>9</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&lt;cfoutput&gt;</td>
<td>4</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Just to be clear, you don't need to worry about the attributes. Just determine the tags and how many times they were used.</p>
<p>For extra credit, check the string passed in and see if it is a directory. If it is, do a recursive list to get all CFMs and then parse all of those files.</p>
<p>For super extra credit (let's call em Ray Points), make your script handle custom tags correctly, including knowing that cfmodule template=&quot;ray.cfm&quot; is the same (potentially) as cf_ray.</p>
<p>By the way, can you guess what the top used tags will be? Ben has talked about this many times in the past.</p>
