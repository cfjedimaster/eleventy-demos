<h1>Post</h1>

<p>If you are bored on this fine Saturday afternoon, please take a look at the MG version of CFLib set up here:</p>
<blockquote>
<a href="http://mg.cflib.org">http://mg.cflib.org</a>
</blockquote>
<p>I need testers to play with the user system only. Register - make mistakes - log on - make mistakes - etc. The password reminder system works as well.</p>
<p>If this works well, then I have a bit more cleanup to do on the front end, and then I dive into the admin, and then CFLib will go live with CFCs and custom tags added to the library.</p>
<p><b>Edited:</b> I forgot to mention. This is JUST testing. Your username will be nuked later on.</p>
