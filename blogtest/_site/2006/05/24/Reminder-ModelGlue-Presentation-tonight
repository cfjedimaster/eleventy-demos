<h1>Post</h1>

<p>Just a reminder that I'll be speaking (virtually) at the <a href="http://www.ncfug.com/">Nashville ColdFusion User Group</a> tonight on Model-Glue. This will be over Breeze, so it is open to folks not in the Nashville area as well. Details may be found <a href="http://www.ncfug.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=dspMeetingInfo">here</a>.</p>
<p>As I said, the subject matter is Model-Glue, which I'm still learning myself, but I'll cover over the basics (I think I have a whopping 5 or so slides) and then show an example Model-Glue site. After building the sample site, I'll show folks a few real Model-Glue applications so they can get an idea of how it works in the wild.</p>
<p>The meeting is from 6:30 to 7:30 CST, so it ends right before Lost. If things run late, I've got the DVR, but you better tie me down as tonight is the finale. All kidding aside - I hope to see you ther!</p>
