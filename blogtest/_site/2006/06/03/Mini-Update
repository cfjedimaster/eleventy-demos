<p>So I know people are just waiting on baited breath to hear the latest on my Mini Cooper, so I thought I'd give an update. About a week ago I sent in a very brief summary of my issues on the <a href="http://www.mini.com">Mini</a> web site. I did not expect to hear back.</p>
<p>On Monday (a holiday in the US) I got a call from the local dealership. I spoke with a tech who once again said the issue was probably &quot;bad gas.&quot; He said this because my gas smelled bad. Errr.... ok. I've never heard of bad gas and I've been using the same few gas stations for years.</p>
<p>Anyway, the tech said he was going to purge the gas and drive it around a bit. I said that was fine, but to tell his boss I still wanted my money back.</p>
<p>Yesterday I got a call from Mini USA. I explained the situation to him. He asked if I had called a lawyer yet and I said I was planning on doing it later in the day. He said (obviously) that they would rather try to fix things w/o lawyers. He told me I should call my local dealer (Brian Harris of Baton Rouge). He was nice, but brought up the same old story the dealer had said that maybe I wasn't driving the car enough.</p>
<p>So anyway, when I mentioned that I wanted the money back, I was told that probably I wouldn't get 100% of it back because of depreciation. When I brought up the Louisiana Lemon law and that I thought it was clear in saying I would get 100% back, he told me he would call the dealer for me, which seemed like a change from his previous tone.</p>
<p>I did try to call a lawyer, but not many handle lemon law cases. I found one, but of course he wasn't in. I'm definitely going to try to reach him again on Monday though.</p>
