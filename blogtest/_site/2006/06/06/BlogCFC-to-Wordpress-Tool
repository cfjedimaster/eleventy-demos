<p>So I don't actually want people to stop using BlogCFC (I couldn't live w/o those wishlist purchases), Sean Tierney has <a href="http://www.scrollinondubs.com/?p=81">posted</a> a utility that will let you migrate from BlogCFC to Wordpress. Apparently if you do, you get to hang out with cooler people. (Just see the picture on the blog entry.) I agree with Sean that providing tools like this actually helps improve BlogCFC, as folks know if they <i>have</i> to leave it, then they aren't &quot;stuck&quot; with it.</p>
<p>Detroit report: The conference actually starts late in the day so I've been out and about in Detroit. I'm in some huge sports bar that has free wireless and an almost completely empty third floor. I'm across the street from Comerica Park. I'm not a baseball fan, but it's a cool looking park. My kids would love it.</p>
