<p>I <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2006/6/2/I-heart-Spry">blogged</a> a few days ago about <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/spry/">Spry</a>, Adobe's AJAX framework. While I was in Detroit, they dared to release a new version (1.1) without telling me. (Those jerks!) For information on what was updated, here is a very good <a href="http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/webforums/forum/messageview.cfm?catid=602&threadid=1161459&enterthread=y">summary</a> from one of the creators.</p>
<p>I also discovered that there is a <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/spryteam/">Spry Blog</a>, but it has not been updated in a while. Adobe Spry Team, consider this my gentle nudge to start updating your blog. :)</p>
<p>I'll update my BlogCFC Spry demo this weekend sometime and post up the new code at that time. I'm also considering using Spry in BlogCFC, specifically for the administrator blog entry editor. It bogs down a bit when you have many entries in your database.</p>
