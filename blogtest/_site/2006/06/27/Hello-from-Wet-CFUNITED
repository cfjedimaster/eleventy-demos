<p>Let me start off and say - yes - my luggage did arrive this time. Thanks Delta for not screwing it up (again). I've seen a lot of people already but can't wait for the real start tomorrow. As I said before, please come up and say hi. In fact, let's have a bit of fun. The first person to come up to me and tell me my favorite movie (no, it's not Star Wars) will get a free copy of the CFWACK book.</p>
<p>I've got my slides ready and hopefully my gigantor three hour session will be fun.</p>
<p>I'll be blogging reviews of session as I sit in them, so stayed tuned tomorrow.</p>
