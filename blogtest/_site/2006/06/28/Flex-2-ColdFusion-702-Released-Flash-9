<p>So I'm probably the last to blog it, but today was the big release day for the Flex 2 platform. (Links will be at the end.) I've already blogged about Flex 2 before and how great it is, but now is an excellent time to download it and start learning the technology. I cannot recommend it enough.</p>
<p>You can download Flex 2 (all the parts, including the IDE, SDK, etc) <a href="http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/tdrc/index.cfm?product=flex">here</a>.<br>
ColdFusion 7.0.2 may be downloaded <a href="http://www.adobe.com/support/coldfusion/downloads_updates.html#mx7">here</a>. And lastly, Flash 9 can be grabbed <a href="http://www.adobe.com/go/getflashplayer">here</a>.</p>
