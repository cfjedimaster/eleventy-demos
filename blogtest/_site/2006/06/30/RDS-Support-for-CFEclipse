<p>Just an FYI, as I wasn't sure of this myself. You do not need Flex Builder 2 in order to get the cool new RDS support for CFEclipse. It is part of the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/support/coldfusion/downloads_updates.html#mx7">CF 7.0.2</a> update, and not part of the FB2 download. RDS lets you browse remote files and databases. The database support is probably my favorite feature as I tend to easily forget the name of particular columns from time to time. There are other cool features in this plugin as well, so it is even worth checking out if you don't plan to upgrade to 7.0.2 yet.</p>
