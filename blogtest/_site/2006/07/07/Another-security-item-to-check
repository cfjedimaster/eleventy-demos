<p>Here is something to give you nightmares about - I just googled for a site and came across a complete admin interface. Totally unprotected. I didn't do anything bad of course, but it is something to watch out for.</p>
<p>Oh - anyone remember when I <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2006/5/30/Do-you-monitor-your-site-feedback">complained</a> about how I never hear back when I report issues on sites? I never did hear back from them. I emailed the site I found this morning, and let's see if I hear back this time.</p>
<p>Two things that really tick me off: Impossible, or really hard to find contact forms and people who don't actually respond.</p>
