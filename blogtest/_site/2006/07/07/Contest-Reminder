<p>Don't forget that my fourth <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2006/6/11/Advanced-ColdFusion-Contest-Announced">ColdFusion Coding Contest</a> is currently in progress. The due date is the end of the month, which, my goodness, is approaching a heck of a lot faster than I thought it would.</p>
<p>Anyone almost done?</p>
<p><b>Edited:</b> I just found out Adobe will be giving away a copy of Flex Builder 2 and the Charting Components. Thanks!</p>
