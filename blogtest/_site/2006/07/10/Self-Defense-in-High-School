<p>Here is a question - why not dump volleyball or soccer in high school for a required self defense class? For girls this seems like a no-brainer, and it would be useful for boys as well. I'm not talking about karate, but simple instructions on how to be safe and defend yourself against attackers.</p>
<p>Are there any high schools doing this?</p>
