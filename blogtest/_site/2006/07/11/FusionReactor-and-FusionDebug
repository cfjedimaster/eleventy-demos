<p>A few weeks ago I <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2006/6/21/Review-FusionReactor-2-Beta">reviewed</a> the beta of Fusion-Reactor 2. It is now released and more information may be found <a href="http://www.fusion-reactor.com/featureFocus-2.0.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>The guys over at Fusion-Reactor have been busy it seems. During CFUNITED, Michael presented on <a href="http://www.fusion-reactor.com/fusiondebug/">FusionDebug</a>. I missed this - but caught the demo on their site and it looks <i>really</i> slick. It is for CFEclipse users and allows for some very impressive debugging capabilities. It isn't released yet, but I'd recommend checking out the demo movie.</p>
<p>Also - if you are in NYC, Michael Dinowitz will be presentingon FusionDebug at the local <a href="http://www.nycfug.org/">user group</a>.</p>
