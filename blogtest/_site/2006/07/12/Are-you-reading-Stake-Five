<p>Are you reading the <a href="http://blogs.sanmathi.org/ashwin/">Stake Five</a> blog? If not, you are making a mistake. Stake Five is written by Ashwin, an engineer on the ColdFusion server product. He just recently posted on <a href="http://blogs.sanmathi.org/ashwin/2006/07/12/tangling-with-the-template-cache/">ColdFusion and the template cache</a> and I'd consider it required reading for anyone working with ColdFusion today. His blog is definitely one you want to watch.</p>
