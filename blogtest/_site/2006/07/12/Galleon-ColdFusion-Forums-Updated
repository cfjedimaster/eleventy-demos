<h1>Post</h1>

<p>After a good 9 or so months, I've finally updated <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/projects/galleon">Galleon ColdFusion Forums</a>. Version 1.6 contains the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Email Confirmation: This is an optional feature. If enabled, a user cannot logon until they click on a link sent via email.
<li>Show the user who made the last post.
<li>The title used for the forums is now dynamic. So you could change it to "Coffee Talk" for example. This title will be used in the UI as well as in emails.
<li>A few other small fixes here and there.
</ul>
<p>As always, you can download it via the <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/projects/galleon">project page</a> and as always, a visit to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/registry/2TCL1D08EZEYE">wishlist</a> is appreciated. (I'm especially anxious to get Prey. :)</p>
