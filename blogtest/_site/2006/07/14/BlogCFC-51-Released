<p>I'm happy to announce the release of <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/projects/blogcfc">BlogCFC 5.1</a>. This release adds some <i>very</i> cool features including a simple content management system. This &quot;mini&quot; CMS allows for content editing outside the blog system. This is a great way to build supporting pages for the blog. Along with the CMS changes, here are some of the other changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Subscriptions now require validation. I had a lot of fake email addresses in my database and this will help clean it out.
<li>You can now send an email to your subscribers. This lets you create a newsletter or just communicate with your subscribers.
<li>Some clean up to the administrator. I added AJAX to the entry editor using Adobe's Spry technology.
<li>Gravatar support in the comments. Gravatar is a cool technology, but the server sucks. There may be something to replace it soon though...
</ul>
<p>As always, you can download from the <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/projects/blogcfc/">project page</a>, and donations to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/registry/2TCL1D08EZEYE">wish list</a> appreciated. (Especially if it's Prey!)</p>
<p>So why haven't I updated this blog to 5.1? My blog is a mess. Truly, it is. I'm working on a new version now with a completely new design. All I have to do is get some of the side content down, and thankfully that is a lot easier now.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
