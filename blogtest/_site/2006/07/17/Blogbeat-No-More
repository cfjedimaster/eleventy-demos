<p>Dang it. My favorite blog stats tool, <a href="http://www.blogbeat.net">Blogbeat</a>, was just bought by <a href="http://www.feedburner.com">FeedBurner</a>. The good news is that the stats will be added into the free edition of FeedBurner. The bad news is this won't be done for a few months. I'm curious to see how well it integrates with FeedBurner. I use FeedBurner for my RSS stats, but the main thing that I worry about is the integration. What I like about Blogbeat is how I can quickly get to the stats without any clutter. I can still access my stats though, which is a nice, and the owner is giving everyone a refund, which is nice as well.</p>
<p>I did try to sign up for MeasureMap, but as I never heard back. It is now part of Google, which kind of worries me. Google Analytics is a nice tool, but they haven't allowed for new entries in about six months now. That's one thing I don't like about Google. They offer great services, but next to no information about when they will upgrade the service.</p>
