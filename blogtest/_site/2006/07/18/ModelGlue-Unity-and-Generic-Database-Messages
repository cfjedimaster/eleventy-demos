<p>One of my favorite new features of <a href="http://www.model-glue.com">Model-Glue: Unity</a> is &quot;Generic Database Messages&quot;. What are those? MG: Unity can use the power of Reactor to allow for simple CRUD (Create/Read/Update/Delete) operations. You don't need to build a controller or model CFCs, you simply follow a standard format within your configuration XML. Let me focus on the basic &quot;Get All&quot; type functionality. Imagine you have a table of groups (this is exactly what I was working on last night). You could get all the groups by adding this to your event:</p>
<code>
&lt;message name="modelglue.GenericList"&gt;
	&lt;argument name="object" value="Groups" /&gt;
&lt;/message&gt;
</code>
<p>This by itself will place a query named GroupsQuery in your view state. You can also customize the result by telling Model-Glue what viewState value to use:</p>
<code>
&lt;message name="modelglue.GenericList"&gt;
	&lt;argument name="object" value="Groups" /&gt;
	&lt;argument name="queryname" value="groupQuery" /&gt;
&lt;/message&gt;
</code>
<p>Let's make it even more complex. Let's filter by some arbitrary property and add a quick sort:</p>
<code>
&lt;message name="modelglue.GenericList"&gt;
	&lt;argument name="object" value="Groups" /&gt;
	&lt;argument name="queryname" value="groupQuery" /&gt;
	&lt;argument name="criteria" value="name"/&gt;
	&lt;argument name="orderBy" value="name" /&gt;
&lt;/message&gt;
</code>
<p>The criteria value tells Model-Glue to look in the event for a filter property. (Remember that Model-Glue automatically folds in all form and url variables to the event.) So if url.filter was &quot;dharma&quot;, then the result query would be filtered by items where the name was dharma. The orderBy does exactly what you would think - order the result by name, ascending. (And yes, you can switch to descending by just adding another argument.)</p>

<p>(As a side note, the above link will take you to the &quot;home&quot; page for that section. If you click the Show link, you will get the full navigation, loaded to the right page. I wish Robohelp would provide a &quot;Link to Here&quot; type functionality. All sites with frames should provide such support.)
This is incredibly useful for rapid development. If you need to employ a customized solution, you can always return later and add a &quot;real&quot; set of Controller/Model CFCs.</p>
