<h1>Post</h1>

<p>This morning (last night?) on cf-talk there was a good <a href="http://www.houseoffusion.com/cf_lists/messages.cfm/forumid:4/threadid:46832">thread</a> started about caching options in ColdFusion. While you have <a href="http://www.techfeed.net/cfQuickDocs/?cfcache">cfcache</a> and query caching out of the box, there are more options out there for advanced caching. On the thread these were mentioned:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pixl8.co.uk/index.cfm/pcms/site.products.CF_Hypercache/">Hypercache</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.hotfusion.co.uk/TurboCache/index.htm">Turbocache</a></p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.sanmathi.org/ashwin/2006/07/01/memory-sensitive-caching-for-cf/">Softcache</a> - This one is by Ashwin of the ColdFusion engineering team!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bpurcell.org/blog/index.cfm?mode=entry&entry=963">CF_Accelerate</a></p>
<p>And lastly, <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/downloads/scopecache.zip">ScopeCache</a> - This is my own tag and it is used in BlogCFC.</p>
<p>Lots of options out there, and I bet there are more, so please share. And it goes without saying (I hope), that simply dropping a cache onto a page is <b>not</b> the way you solve performance problems. It is the &quot;Final Solution&quot; only and should be used if you have determined, absolutely, that there is no other way to speed up the page.</p>
