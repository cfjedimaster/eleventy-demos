<p>So I thought I'd blog about a problem I've run into a few times now. Hopefully this will help people avoid the mistake I've made.</p>
<p>I was working on a user editor and as part of the process, I get the groups value from the event scope.</p>
<code>
&lt;cfset var groups = arguments.event.getValue("groups")&gt;
</code>
<p>Whenever I passed this value to my code to update the groups for a user, I kept getting an empty value groups. The first thing I checked was to see if I had named the form field right. That was ok. I then used this code to debug my event:</p>
<code>
&lt;cfdump var="#arguments.event.getAllValues()#"&gt;
</code>
<p>This didn't show anything different. The groups value was definitely blank.</p>
<p>I then remembered why it was blank. I was slowly rolling the  &quot;Groups&quot; concept into the site. As part of my updates, I was adding the user's current groups to the event state in my onRequestStart controller method. Basically, I was setting groups to blank and overriding my form value.</p>
<p>This is the second time I've done this and I think what I'm going to do is start writing down (in the project notes, core source code, wherever), a list of all values set by onRequestStart. Just to ensure I &quot;stay out of the way&quot; of those values.</p>
