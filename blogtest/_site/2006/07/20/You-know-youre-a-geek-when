<p>You notice your cable box turned itself off last night, and when you power it up and notice the on screen menu is <i>slightly</i> different, so you spend the next ten minutes going over every single menu to see what is new.</p>
<p>And yes - I did that this morning. As far as I can see, all that changes was:</p>
<ul>
<li>Confirmations for deletes. Ugh. I call this the idiot option. I hit delete because I want to delete.
<li>On your list of recorded items, items you haven't watched yet are bold. Just like my email client. Now that I like.
<li>Tips. So normally the first thing I do with an application that has tips at startup is to disable it - but I'm really curious to see what kind of tips my cable box would have.
<li>Last but not least, there is some new menu item for Notifications. I'm not sure what they will be, but I'm sure they will be interesting and informative. Ahem. 
</ul>
<p>Oh - I forgot to mention. There is one feature I'd kill for. My very first Digital Cable box in California had a wonderful feature. You could remove channels. Not only would the channel go away if you were moving up and down the selections, it went away from the guide. I was able to get my guide down to a very short list of channels I cared about. No BET. No CMT. No Senata channel. I have yet to see this feature again. Sure you can skip channels, but it only works if you are moving up and down. Who does that now?</p>
