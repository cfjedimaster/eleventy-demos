<p>Thanks to everyone who sent me the note about CFCDev going crazy. This happens once every few months when I slip and let the hard drive fill up. ColdFusion's &quot;coldfusion-out.log&quot; file is not rolled over like other CF logs, and unfortunately, it tends to grow huge pretty quickly. I really, really hope Adobe fixes this in 8. Anyway, the file got too big, and MailEnable, my mail server, really doesn't like it. In fact, it tends to go ape-you know what when the drive gets too low.</p>
<p>So - I got in - nuke the SMTP queue - and things normally return to normal. I'm going to reinstall ColdFusion on the D drive, but I'm still going to need a solution. I think I'm going to try <a href="http://mkruger.cfwebtools.com/index.cfm?mode=entry&entry=FAA7AF4D-DAC6-7DE0-407EBD09D15D9FC0">this one</a>.</p>
<p>My good buddy Jim sent me a nice Lost related link:</p>

<p>A few interesting things here, and technically they are spoilers, but I wouldn't worry too much. The coolest thing is that the &quot;Foot&quot; will return and the implication is that the island is a lot older than we think.</p>
