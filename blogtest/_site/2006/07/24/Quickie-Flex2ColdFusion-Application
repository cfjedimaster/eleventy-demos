<p>This morning I demonstrated a quick way to add a simple image browser to a ColdFusion site. Someone suggested Flash Forms, but I thought Flex 2 would make a better example. So with that in mind, here is a simple Flex 2 version of the slide show:</p>

<p>A few quick notes. You will notice that the main fle is a CFM, but I don't use any ColdFusion in it. Instead, I simply load up the SWF I created. The Flex file does make use of a CFM file like so:</p>
<code>
&lt;mx:HTTPService id="imageService" url="imageservice.cfm" result="loadImages(event)" fault="faultHandler(event)"&gt;
</code>
<p>I used the HTTPService for simplicity's sake. Also, if I had used Flash Remoting, it would only work for folks who have ColdFusion 7.0.2. This should work on just about any server. I then modified the ColdFusion script I had used before so that it output XML. Oh, and how difficult was it to use that XML? Here is the code called when the HTTPService is done running.</p>
<code>
imageList = event.result.images.image;
</code>
<p>That's it. Flex lets me treat the result as an ArrayCollection, and I can then simply use the &quot;path&quot; of the XML data to load the array.</p>
<p>Normally I'd paste in more code, but why bother? If you right click on the Flex app you will see a &quot;View Source&quot; link. You can take this code, and compile it, and then use it in your file. All you need to do is ensure the SWF/CFM exist in the same folder as your image.</p>
<p>Let me be absolutely clear. This was made just for fun. I don't mind folks using my ColdFusion code, but remember I'm still a Flex newbie. In fact, I'd love some feedback. How do I get that Next button to right align with the image? How can I get rid of the gray border around the app? I used a bgcolor of white, but I still get grey in my display.</p>
