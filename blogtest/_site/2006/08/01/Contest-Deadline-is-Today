<p>Technically the deadline was midnight this morning, but I will still accept entries for my <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2006/6/11/Advanced-ColdFusion-Contest-Announced">contest</a> today. I know a few people who said they would and didn't send anything in. What's the matter - you chicken???</p>
