<p>The deadline for submissions for this year's <a href="http://www.adobe.com/go/cf_awards">MAX Awards</a> is September 1. There will be one award for eight categories. My former employer won a MAX award two years ago and I have to say that it is a pretty darn cool experience. My only gripe is that it is very &quot;design&quot; heavy, which, I have to admit, makes the most sense. I mean, I'd love to see an award for a ColdFusion application that saves a company both time and money, but that wouldn't be very sexy to show on screen.</p>
<p>I'd also love to see a MAX award go to a community offering, but I'm probably a bit biased there. ;)</p>
<p><b>Edited:</b> Had the wrong date.</p>
