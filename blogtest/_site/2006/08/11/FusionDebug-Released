<p>The Fusion Reactor folks have released <a href="http://www.fusion-reactor.com/fusiondebug/index.html">FusionDebug</a> today. The price isn't bad - 299 - but one of my numerous spies told me that if you whisper &quot;CFCOMMUNITY&quot; you get a 10% discount. Be sure to use that money saved for a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/registry/2TCL1D08EZEYE">good cause</a>!</p>
<p>Seriously though - I was able to play with the early beta of this product (not the later ones) and it truly rocks. I'll post a screen shot or two once I get the final version.</p>
