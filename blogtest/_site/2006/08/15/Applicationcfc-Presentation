<p>As a member of the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/communities/experts/">Adobe Community Expert</a> group, I'm given access to Adobe Breeze. While I'm currently preparing for a few upcoming <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/speakingengagements.cfm">speaking engagements</a>, I thought I'd try out the Breeze account Adobe is sharing with me.</p>
<p>With that in mind - can I get a show of hands from people who <i>think</i> they could attend a meeting at the end of this month, let's say August 30th, at night, let's say around 6PM, on the topic of Application.cfc.</p>
<p>This is not firm, but I'm interested in see who could possibly show up. If this works, I may start doing a monthly presentation (can I call it the Jedi User Group without being sued by Lucas?) on various topics.</p>
