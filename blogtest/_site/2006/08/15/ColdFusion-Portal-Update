<h1>Post</h1>

<p>Some big updates to the <a href="http://www.coldfusionportal.org">ColdFusion Portal</a> this morning:</p>
<ul>
<li>Refreshed the blog list. It now contains data from MXNA, the Goog, and a custom set of data. I've done this so I don't have to enter data manually (or not do it often). My plan is to refresh this monthly.
<li>Podcasts added.
<li>User Groups added. (Thanks Ed and Christine of Adobe!)
<li>Small layout tweaks here and there.
</ul>
<p>Enjoy. I don't know about you, but for me, the best part of the portal are the items in the left column. I love having the direct download and documentation links.</p>
