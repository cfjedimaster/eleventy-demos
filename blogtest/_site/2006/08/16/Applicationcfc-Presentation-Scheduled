<h1>Post</h1>

<p>Yesterday I posted a query to see who would be interested in a presentation on Application.cfc. I got quite a response, so this morning I went ahead and formally scheduled the meeting.</p>
<p>It will be held on August 30th (a Wednesday) at 6PM Central.</p>
<p>I'm starting simple this time with an introduction to Application.cfc. Let me stress that this will be for <b>beginners</b>, but, after the basics are done it may evolve into more based on Q and A, etc. I just want to be clear to folks that I'm starting with a simple one to just test the waters.</p>
<p>If this works out - I will make it a regular event. I think I'd love to do Model-Glue again (I did a presentation on this a few months ago) as well as my Spry presentation for those who couldn't make the last one. (Speaking of which, I'm going to blog about how I do AJAX with Model-Glue sometime later in the week.)</p>
