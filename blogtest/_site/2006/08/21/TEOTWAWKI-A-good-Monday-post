<p>So I know I'm not the only who thinks <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TEOTWAWKI">TEOTWAWKI</a> is a fun concept, but little did I know how many people are actively planning for it: <a href="http://www.portlandmercury.com/portland/Content?oid=51732&category=34029">Apocalpse Soon</a> (As a warning, the link contains profanity, don't read it out loud to your three year old.) I have to be absolutely honest. There is a small part of me (very small) that thinks this kind of training isn't such a bad idea. It's not like we have to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skynet">invent</a> a way to blow ourselves up to kingdom come. Of course, people have been predicting this for a <i>very</i> long time. My personal opinion is that I can easily see ourselves killing a good 90-99% of the life on the planet, but that nature is strong and would find a way to recover. Just look at the amount of life that exists by the superheated vents under water.</p>
