<p>I'm a little late to announce this, but if you are interested in learning about Flex 2, check out <a href="http://www.onflex.org/ted/2006/08/introducing-flextv_23.php">FlexTV</a> by Ted Patrick of Adobe. The initial movie is only about 15 minutes long, but gives you a nice introduction to Flex Builder and creating Flex projects.</p>
