I am a beginner in coldfusion technology. And I want to improve my skills by practising some good applications.
So can anyone suggest me any website or any application to work?
</blockquote>
<p>I am very happy to see this question. I'm a huge believer in using real applications, or at least real problems, to learn languages. For example - typically you learn about a language by seeing extremely simple examples. Normally these examples focus on one thing, a particular function or tag. I find that I don't learn well like this. Sure, while I'm reading the doc it is fresh, but until I use it in an application, I don't really learn it. I've found that this is my main problem with Java. I've &quot;learned&quot; it a few times now, but just haven't had the time to get practical experience with it. That's why I'm trying to be more pro-active with Flex2 and Spry. (In fact, I've got a new Flex2 game in the works I hope to release soon.)</p>

<p>For example, I wrote <a href="http://www.deathclock.com">The Death Clock</a> way back in the early 90s as a way to learn Perl. I converted it to ColdFusion to help me learn ColdFusion. I wrote this blogware as a learning exercise.</p>
<p>Let me suggest this: Find an application that interests you. It need not be a giant application, or even an entire site. It can as simple as a calendar application. Build it out as complete as you can. It will be horrible. Trust me. But you will gain &quot;real&quot; experience and will be able to return to the application later and improve it.</p>
<p>One nice thing about &quot;real&quot; applications is that you don't have to map it out. You know what a calendar application should do. You know what a blog application should do. Not having to worry about the feature design phase means you can move more quicker into the actual coding phase.</p>
