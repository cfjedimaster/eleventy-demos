<p>I've got an ex-coworker of mine who needs a new job: <a href="http://www.heekoh.com">Heejung Koh</a>. I have the <b>utmost</b> respect for her design work, and she was a pleasure to work with. (In other words, she didn't get mad when I kept bugging her for design specs!) She needs a full time job as she is not a US citizen. Her contact information is at her site.</p>
