<p>Since I know people are just insane with curiosity, I thought I'd post another update about my Mini Cooper, or as I call it, S*** on Wheels. I don't think I've been that strong in my posts before, but I'm <i>really</i> getting ticked now.</p>
<p>About six weeks ago, a reader met up with a Mini USA representative at a BMW Motorcycle rally. This reader (thank you by the way!) told the rep my story, and the rep gave him his phone number.</p>
<p>I called the rep and told him the sad story, and basically said that I'd like my money back, but I've given up any and all hope. He promised to look into it and get back to me.</p>
<p>Fast forward about three weeks. I called the rep back, and of course, he had no idea who I was, so he had to look up my case again. He promised to look into it and asked me to call back in 2 days if I didn't hear back.</p>
<p>I didn't hear back. Anyone surprised? So I call him a few days ago and he said he had called Brian Harris BMW and had not gotten a response.</p>
<p>Now wait - it gets better. Yesterday I get a call from Brian Harris. There was a very nice and polite woman on the phone asking why Mini USA had called them.</p>
<p>-sigh-</p>
<p>So I gave her the two minute review (for what must have been the 100th time) and she said what I had heard before, that they can't help me so she would call Mini USA back.</p>
<p>All I want is the car I used to love and trust and drive for fun. But I guess that is too much to ask for. We are going to put an ad in the paper and sell this thing off. (And yes, we will share the service history with any potential buyer.)</p>
