<p>Ok, I swear I'm not going to turn this into a Mini Cooper rant blog, but I had some interesting discoveries on Friday I wanted to share. First off: My wife and I had decided we weren't really interested in going to court. It seemed like a lot of trouble. But the lawyer called us on Friday and really wants to work with us.</p>
<p>Then my wife did a bit of research. Now - it is not surprising that she found folks complaining about Mini Cooper. You can find people complaining about <i>anything</i> on the Internet. However, some of what she found was pretty interesting. Consider...</p>

<p>From this entry: &quot;Performance issues - idling too low, jerking motion when shifting gears automatic mode, loss of power and then jumping forward from a stopped position to go&quot;</p>
<p>This is exactly something my Mini did. She also mentions indicator lights - we had that issue with our trunk. (Which by the way Brian Harris said was our fault for slamming the trunk.)</p>

<p>From this entry - note how they accused one person of driving into a swamp (in NYC). My favorite quote from here though: &quot;The Operations Manager first stated BMWs weren't subject to lemon laws!&quot; Another quote:</p>
<blockquote>
I only slightly under 30,000 miles on my 2003 Mini-Cooper and was told I had to pay for a battery replacement because I had not driven the car enough. Even though I drive my car daily to work - I have to pay over $200 for a new battery because I did not use the car enough - this is so ridiculous. Talked to several Mini representative and all say the same - Mini Policy and yet it is not in the Policy Book provided upon purchase.
</blockquote>
<p>This is also what Brian Harris told us multiple times - that we didn't drive the car enough. Gee - what is it? Not driving the car enough or driving into swamps?</p>
<p>My wife had Brian Harris send over our service history via fax, and it is amazing how much of the history is a list of things <b>we</b> did wrong. Not driving it enough. Slamming the trunk. Using &quot;bad gas&quot;.</p>
<p>You know what - screw this. We will fight.</p>
