<p>YouTube has a video which reveals the secrets behind <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PPCCcXarkc">Dharma</a>. This can be considered a big spoiler, although to be honest, it doesn't actually answer <i>everything</i>. Personally, I'm pretty psyched about what this video reveals, but I've been a Lost addict since day one anyway. I'm definitely not surprised by the revelation that Dharma had good intentions, especially after the &quot;We're the good guys&quot; comment at the end of season two.</p>
