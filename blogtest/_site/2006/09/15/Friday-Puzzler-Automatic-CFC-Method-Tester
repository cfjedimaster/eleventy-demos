<p>One of the cooler features of ColdFusion components is their metadata. This lets you dig into the CFC via CFML and can enable some pretty powerful features. (See <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/projects/canvas">Canvas</a> or the new rendering engine in <a href="http://www.blogcfc.com">BlogCFC 5.5</a> for examples.) Building on the fact that CF lets you grab this metadata easily, let me see how you build the following:</p>
<p>Write code that accepts as input both a CFC (dotted notation path) and a method (yes, you could grab this via metadata, but I'm trying to keep the contest short). Your code will then generate a form with inputs for all method arguments.</p>
<p>The code can assume nicely documented CFCs. (Ie, the method arguments all have type attributes.)</p>
<p>If you are really eager, don't prompt for the method, but just the CFC and follow it up with a prompt for the method where you provide the methods for the user.</p>
<p>The code should be a self posting form and should invoke the data sent by the user using cfinvoke. This will let you build the tester for methods that are not remote.</p>
<p>Anyone game for this?</p>
