<p>It's Sunday, so I'll continue my trend of inane useless posts. I'm currently reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FYear-Our-War-Steph-Swainston%2Fdp%2F0060753870%2Fsr%3D8-1%2Fqid%3D1158549350%2Fref%3Dpd%5Fbbs%5F1%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks&tag=raymondcamden-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">The Year of Our War</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=raymondcamden-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />. It is a pretty good book so far. I'm not quite sure if I actually like it - but it is definitely interesting and unique. A night ago I came across a line that I thought was pure gold:</p>
