<p>Lighthouse Pro had a very minor update, a fix to one of the new files that let you edit statuses. You can download Lighthouse Pro from the <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/projects/lhp">project page</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking of project pages, I finally added one for <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/projects/toxml">toXML</a>, my component for generating XML from ColdFusion variables.</p>
<p>Lastly, a reader sent me an email today about Canvas, my wiki.  The amount of changes he has done is amazing. As soon as he sends me the code I'm going to start going over it and double checking it. This will be an incredible update to the product I think.</p>
