<h1>Post</h1>

<p>I've uploaded two quick references that I built yesterday. These files were built with a combination of a local XML file I had for the <a href="http://www.coldfusioncookbook.com">ColdFusion Cookbook</a> and via some Livedocs scraping. I generally use <a href="http://www.cfquickdocs.com">cfQuickDocs</a> for all of my doc needs, but I wanted something that would work when I was offline. While I do have the local docs, I've never cared for the &quot;chrome&quot; in use at the local docs and at livedocs. These will be added to my guides pod in a moment, but comments are welcome.</p>
