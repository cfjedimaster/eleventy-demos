<p>If you are in the UK (or can afford to travel to it), check out <a href="http://www.cfdevcon.com/">CFDEVCON</a>. It is a one day conference on November 9 in Surrey, about 30 minutes or so from London. The price is 40 pounds (plus VAT), and if the exchange rate is anything like it was last time I was in England, that is only about 50-60 American dollars, which is pretty darn cheap if you ask me. Registration is open and some <a href="http://www.cfdevcon.com/#speakers">speakers and topics</a> are already announced.</p>
<p>You know - a long time ago (in Internet years), there used to be quite a few ColdFusion conferences. It seems like we are slowly returning to the those &quot;good ole days&quot; and I'm pretty darn happy to see it. (Now we just need to get CFSOUTH back - anyone want to help me? :)</p>
