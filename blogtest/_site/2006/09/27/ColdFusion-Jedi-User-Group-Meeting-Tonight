<p>Tonight is the second meeting of my &quot;ColdFusion Jedi User Group&quot;, which I know is a silly name and all, but I had to come up with something. The meeting will be at 6PM Central. The topic will be &quot;Adding a Basic Security System to a Web Application&quot;, which is a lot more complex than it really is. I'm simply talking about how to add basic security (username/password) and roles to an application. <b>This class is for beginners!</b></p>
<p>The URL is:</p>

<p>I anticipate this meeting being a short one, and I'll try to have some tea with me so I don't sound too much like an aging jazz singer.</p>
