<p>Yet another post in my coverage of Manning and his friends beating up some poor guy using a laptop. I last wrote about this back in <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2006/5/18/Round-two-goes-to-the-nerd">May</a> when Manning was officially charged. My friend CJ sent me this link:</p>
<p><a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/news;_ylt=Ais3AcNGztGIV7iH5zjFRlxDubYF?slug=ap-bears-manningassault&prov=ap&type=lgns">Bear DB Manning pleads no contest to assault</a></p>
<p>He is getting off lucky with community service if you ask me. I think he should spend some time in jail, even if just a few days. Hopefully the poor guy he beat up will sue him and get a pretty penny out of him.</p>
