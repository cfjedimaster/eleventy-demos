<h1>Post</h1>

<p>This is my last post before heading out for vacation. I'll be checking email at night, but not really posting. Oh, let me give a big thanks to Enterprise Rent-A-Car. My wife and I made a &quot;reservation&quot; two weeks ago. When I called today, I was told the car we wanted wasn't there, and that it would possible show up any day now.</p>
<p>Serious.</p>
<p>They then told me they were working to find me another car (we needed a car to fit 7) and then promptly left at 1PM without even calling.</p>
<p>Thanks a lot Enterprise. Wasn't there a Seinfeld episode once where he asked how they could call it a &quot;reservation&quot; when nothing was actually reserved?</p>
<p>Luckily we picked up a good vehicle from Budget and well - it is time for me to not worry anymore. Good bye!</p>
