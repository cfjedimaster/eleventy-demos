<p>Just a quick note - but the Battlestar Galactica season opener was absolutely amazing. As much as I love Lost, the BSG premier blew it out of the water. By a long shot. I've said it before but if you aren't watching BSG, you need to - even if you aren't a big Sci Fi fan.</p>
<p>(And I promise - next week that ColdFusion posts return. :)</p>
