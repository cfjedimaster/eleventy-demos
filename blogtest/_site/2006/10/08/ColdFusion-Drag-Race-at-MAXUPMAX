<p>My session at <a href="http://barcamp.org/MAXUP">MAXUP</a> is entitled ColdFusion Drag Race. The session will be from 12 to 1 on Wednesday, right at lunch so you won't be missing anything if you attend.</p>
<p>The idea is simple. Show up with your laptop and ColdFusion installed. You will have thirty minutes to write an application. What application? I'm not telling. You have to show up to find out. We will then spend thirty minutes looking at what you wrote. It's ok if you don't finish completely. We will judge as a group and have <i>significant</i> prizes to give away.</p>
<p>I hope to see you there!</p>
