<p>A user contacted me today and mentioned that he is looking to start a hosting service specially designed for ColdFusion users. He wanted to know what the top things CF developers would want out of a host - and also what bugs them out their current hosts.</p>
<p>As an aside, my host is CFXHosting.com. They have graciously allowed me to host my ColdFusion sites for free for some time, so I always try to take the opportunity to mention them to my readers.</p>
