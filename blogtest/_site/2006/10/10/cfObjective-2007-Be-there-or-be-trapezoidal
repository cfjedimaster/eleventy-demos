<p>Jared just sent me a quick note to say that <a href="http://www.cfobjective.com/">cf.Objective() 2007</a> is on! It is scheduled for May 3-6 in Minneapolis, MN. I've heard rumours that it may even be warm there in May. (Sounds crazy to me. In Louisiana May normally means 90+ degrees every day.)</p>
<p>Once again - I am <b>very</b> happy to see the growth of ColdFusion conferences again! Bring on CFSOUTH 2007 in Lafayette! :)</p>
