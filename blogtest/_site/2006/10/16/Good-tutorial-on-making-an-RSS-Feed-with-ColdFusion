<h1>Post</h1>

<p>I was planning a simple tutorial on how to create an RSS feed. This would be a very simple and direct &quot;Do This&quot;, and not &quot;Here are the ten thousand versions of RSS&quot; type of article, but Pete beat me to it. You can find this article here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.petefreitag.com/item/465.cfm">Howto Create an RSS 2.0 Feed</a></p>
<p>If you just need to get a RSS feed up quickly, this is the article for you.</p>
<p>By the way - time for a &lt;cftease&gt; - In a few days (or week or so, but close) something is going to launch. What is it? I can't say. But I can say it is the main reason my open source applications have slowed down quite a bit the last few months.</p>
