<p>The repeat of my last CFJUG meeting will be tonight at 5PM CST. The URL is:</p>
<p><a href="http://adobechats.adobe.acrobat.com/basicsecurity2/">http://adobechats.adobe.acrobat.com/basicsecurity2/</a></p>
<p>Only a few folks RSVPed, but I feel bad that the recording didn't work last time so I'll try to get it right this time.</p>
<p>As a reminder - this class is for folks who are <i>extremely</i> new to ColdFusion. I'm discussing how to add username/passwords and authentication to a web application. Most of my readers won't need this - but may have a coworker who could learn from it.</p>
