<p>Good news! <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/downloads/default.mspx">IE7</a> is now available.</p>
<p>So. Um. Hey Microsoft? You guys just let me know when I can download IE7 and not break my IE6. Because - well - I'm a web developer. Have you guys heard of them? We make web sites.</p>
<p>Anyway - one of the things we have to do - and have been doing now for almost ten years - is develop on different browsers. You know the routine. You write your HTML and then see how it looks in Firefox (Heard of them? They make a cool browser as well.) and then IE. If I can't run multiple versions of IE, it will be difficult to see how my sites look for all of my customers.</p>
<p>So I'm sure you get the idea. I need to be able to run my IE6 and IE7 at the same time.</p>
<p>So yeah - as I said - just drop me a line. I mean, I can't <i>seriously</i> imagine you expect me to install a completely  different copy of Windows <i>just</i> to run IE. That would just be insane.</p>
