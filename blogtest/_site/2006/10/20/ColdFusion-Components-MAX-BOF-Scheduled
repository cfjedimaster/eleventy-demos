<p>While I don't think it is actually online yet, my CFC BOF at MAX will be on Wednesday night at 6:30 PM. I hope to see you there! For folks who don't know what I'm talking about - the CFC BOF (Birds of a Feather) is a session for folks to come together and talk about CFCs in general. There is no outline. We will discuss whatever you want to talk about. This is for folks of <b>all</b> skill levels, and I'd especially encourage folks who are just learning CFCs to attend and ask questions.</p>
<p>As a nice form of bribery, I'll be giving away a copy of CFWACK, and maybe the Advanced book, during the CFC.</p>
