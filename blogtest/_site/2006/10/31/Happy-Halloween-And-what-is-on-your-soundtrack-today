<p>What's going to be on your playlist today to help celebrate Halloween? For me its:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Bloodletting</b> by Concrete Blonde. A cool song that got way overplayed at the local bar during college. Now that it is a few years past though it has regained the cool factor for me.
<li><b>Everyday is Halloween</b> by Ministry. This is before they got all industrial and were a bit more like a harsher Depeche Mode.
</ul>
<p>Any other suggestions? If anyone says <b>Monster Mash</b> I'm banning them forever! ;)</p>
