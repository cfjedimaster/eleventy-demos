<p>The latest release of BlogCFC is now available at <a href="http://blogcfc.riaforge.org">http://blogcfc.riaforge.org</a>.  Normally I don't mention small updates here - but this release now enables Adobe Contribute access. BlogCFC has had XML-RPC for a few releases now - but I've made some improvements to it in order to enable Contribute to work with it. Enjoy.</p>
<p>Secondly - my ColdFusion Yahoo Package (<a href="http://cfyahoo.riaforge.org">http://cfyahoo.riaforge.org</a>) has been updated as well. The package now gives ColdFusion the ability to use the following Yahoo services. (And kudos again to Yahoo for providing simple and easy to use services!)</p>
<ul>
<li>Answers
<li>Artist / Album / Song Search
<li>Contextual Search
<li>Geocoding
<li>Maps (Advanced support coming soon)
<li>News Search
<li>Related Search Suggestions
<li>Web Search
<li>Spelling Suggestions
<li>Term Extraction
<li>Traffic Reports
<li>Weather Reports
</ul>
<p>Enjoy. (Now I don't feel so bad for all the off topic posts. ;)</p>
