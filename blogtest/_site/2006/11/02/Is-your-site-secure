<p>I hate to cross post - but Pete posted a good entry today everone should read:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.petefreitag.com/item/593.cfm">Web Application Vulnerabilities trump Buffer Overflows</a></p>
<p>Pete discusses a study that shows that web application vulnerabilities now make up the top three attack vectors. I know I harp on this quite a bit on this blog (and my November CFJUG meeting was going to discuss this), but it is truly appalling how bad web application security is now. To be clear - I'm not perfect - but let me ask you this:</p>
<p>Consider the last ten jobs you did. Of those jobs - how many clients brought up web application security?</p>
<p>I don't mean &quot;We need a username/password protected admin folder&quot;, but rather security as a whole for the entire site. Questions like:</p>
<p>&quot;Are we exposing any web services we don't want to?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Are we properly checking all input for both cross site scripting attacks as well as authorization purposes?&quot;</p>
<p>How many people integrate questions like this into a report to be handed off to a client? How many people bring it up if the client does not? Of course, most of my readers will probably do all of this and more - but we need to ensure we reach out to those new CF developers and ensure they &quot;get the message&quot;.</p>
