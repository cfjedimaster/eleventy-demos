<h1>Post</h1>

<p>This morning Todd released a cool new tool, the <a href="http://cfcflexplorer.riaforge.org/">cfcFlexExplorer</a>.  This is a tool based on the <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2006/9/15/Friday-Puzzler-Automatic-CFC-Method-Tester">Friday Puzzler</a> I did back in September. It lets you both introspect CFCs as well as run methods on them. See Todd's <a href="http://cfsilence.com/blog/client/index.cfm/2006/11/6/cfcFlexplorer-01-Released">blog post</a> for screen shots and a demo, and of course check the project out at RIAForge: <a href="http://cfcflexplorer.riaforge.org/">http://cfcexplorer.riaforge.org</a></p>
<p>ColdFusion and Flex is the new peanut butter and chocolate.</p>
