<p>In an effort to try to minimize my blogging about the cool TV shows that seem to have cropped up this season, I've set up a new forum called <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/forums/forums.cfm?conferenceid=BDDEBB9D-E001-6659-BC7A3C34BAE80EF2">Geek TV</a>. Right now there is a grand total of 3 of us talking so please join us.</p>
