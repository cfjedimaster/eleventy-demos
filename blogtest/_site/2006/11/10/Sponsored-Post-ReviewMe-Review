<p>I've been using <a href="http://www.text-link-ads.com">Text Link Ads</a> on my site for a while now. I don't know if my readers notice them, but they are the small, text based (imagine that) ads to the right of the browser. About a week ago I got an invite to join <a href="http://www.reviewme.com">ReviewMe</a>. The concept is simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>You write a review.
<li>They pay you.
<li>Your review <b>must</b> state that you were paid for the review.
<li>And yes - you can write negative reviews.
</ul>
<p>As someone who considers himself a semi-professional blogger, I'm not quite sure how I feel about this. On the one hand - the service goes out of its way to ensure that you tell your readers that you are getting paid to review. (And to be clear - I'm trying out this service myself and I <b>am</b> getting paid.) They also make it clear you can write negative reviews. So I don't get a &quot;scummy&quot; feel from them.</p>
<p>At the same time though - I like to review products that matter to me and my readers. I don't need to get paid to do them. I get paid typically by folks clicking on related ads or visiting my wishlist. So this feels like it may be on the edge of ... I don't know. Something.</p>
<p>I can say if they were to hook me up with the actual software I was reviewing (which could actually be worth a <b>lot</b> more than the normal payout) I'd feel better about it. Ditto for reviews on <a href="http://www.kidgamers.org">KidGamers</a>. (Oh, and yes,  Nintendo, I'd be happy to review the Wii.)</p>
<p>If you are a blogger and would like to see a few other reviews, check out these:</p>

<p>One thing for sure - the old &quot;Slap a Google Ad Up&quot; model is slowly getting replaced by more interesting ad types. Is that good or bad?</p>
