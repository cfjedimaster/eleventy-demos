<p>So Jeff let me know that the Breeze room for his user group will support the general public, so if you want to see me present on Spry (and ColdFusion), come by tomorrow night at 5PM Central. The URL is:</p>
<p><a href="http://adobechats.adobe.acrobat.com/ctcfug200611/">http://adobechats.adobe.acrobat.com/ctcfug200611/</a></p>
<p>And again - it is tomorrow (Wednesday) at 5PM Central. For those who can't make it - it will be recorded and my files will be available.</p>
