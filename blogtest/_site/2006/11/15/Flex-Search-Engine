<p>Ted Patrick, Flex Evangelist, released the first alpha of his <a href="http://www.onflex.org/ted/2006/11/flex-search-alpha-1.php">Flex Search Engine</a>. What does it search? Flex content of course. Specifically:</p>
<blockquote>
The current engine contains the collective history of Flexcoders, FlexComponents, Flex Developer Center articles, Flex documentation, AS3 documentation, and soon blogs from the flex community.
</blockquote>
<p>The Flex app was written in about thirty minutes, which seems just about right. The back end is all ColdFusion, using MySQL and it's full text search engine.</p>
<p>Just another darn good example of Flex and ColdFusion!</p>
