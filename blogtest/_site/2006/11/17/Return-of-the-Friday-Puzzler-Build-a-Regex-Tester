<p>A few days ago I <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2006/11/7/Regex-Coach">talked </a> about how I normally did quick regex tests: I would write up some code in a CFM page and run it in my browser. Obviously a dedicated tool is better and more efficient. But pretend for a moment that you didn't have such a tool. Or perhaps you are not at your own machine and just want to quickly test something.</p>
<p>Today's challenge is really trivial. Simply build a form that lets you input a string and a regex. Than show the results of ColdFusion using that regex on the string. In theory that should take you about two through three minutes, but consider adding some polish. For example - maybe Spry could be used to generate the results? I can think of a few other ideas as well to make the results pretty.</p>
<p>Enjoy. For those of you new to my little puzzlers (sorry it has been so long), do not remember the rules: Don't take more than five or ten minutes to finish the code. There is no prize - just the fun of coding. That's it!</p>
