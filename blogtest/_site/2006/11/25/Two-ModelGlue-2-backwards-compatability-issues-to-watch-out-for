<p>Joe has worked very hard to make <a href="http://www.model-glue.com">Model-Glue 2</a> backwards compatible, but I ran into two small issues today I wanted to warn people about. (I've already sent a bug report to Joe.)</p>
<p>First off - in case it isn't obvious - these issues only occurred with a Model-Glue 1.1 application, and may not involve all MG 1.1 applications, but it did affect the <a href="http://www.coldfusioncookbook.com">ColdFusion Cookbook</a>.</p>
<p>Issue 1: On loading the application, you get an error about a key not defined: rescaffoldKey. This is the URL variable Model-Glue 2 looks for to recreate the scaffolds. I simply added this to my Model-Glue.xml settings block:</p>
<code>
&lt;setting name="rescaffoldKey" value="rescaffold" /&gt;
</code>
<p>Issue 2: It looks as if Model-Glue debugging will display even if you have debugging turned off. I forced it off using this in my Application.cfm file:</p>
<code>
&lt;cfset request.modelGlueSuppressDebugging = true /&gt;
</code>
<p>(For more information on this setting, see <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2006/9/18/Per-request-debugging-in-ModelGlue">this entry</a>.)</p>
<p>Obviously Model-Glue 2 isn't official yet so you take your own risks deploying it live - but it has been <i>very</i> stable (and fast) for me so far.</p>
