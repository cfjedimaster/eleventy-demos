<p>Chalk this up to the &quot;I can't believe you never saw this before&quot; file. While this is incredibly obvious, I never really ran into this today. Where you put your CFERROR tag (for those using Application.cfm instead of Application.cfc) matters. Consider:</p>
<code>
&lt;cferror template="exception.cfm" type="exception"&gt;
&lt;cfoutput&gt;#x#&lt;/cfoutput&gt;
</code>
<p>The code above will work correctly.</p>
<code>
&lt;cfoutput&gt;#x#&lt;/cfoutput&gt;
&lt;cferror template="exception.cfm" type="exception"&gt;
</code>
<p>The code above will <b>not</b> work correctly because the error occurs before ColdFusion has been told what to do with an error. As I said - incredibly obvious but it never really bit me in the rear till today.</p>
<p>Now you might say - why not just move it to the top of your Application.cfm file. Well that would work - but what if your exception handler itself uses variables in the Application scope? For example - an application.adminemail setting to know where to fire off error reports. I think you might consider doing code something like so in your exception handler:</p>
<code>
&lt;cfif not structKeyExists(application, "adminemail")&gt;
  &lt;cfset mailTo="some hard coded address"&gt;
&lt;cfelse&gt;
  &lt;cfset mailTo = application.adminemail&gt;
&lt;/cfif&gt;
</code>
<p>While it is never nice to hard code values - it might be acceptable as a last case resort. Someone remind me tomorrow and I'll post my &quot;typical&quot; exception handler.</p>
