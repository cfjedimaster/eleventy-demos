<p>It wasn't too long ago that <a href="http://www.riaforge.org">RIAForge</a> was announced. Just in case you don't know what it is - RIAForge is a site that offers hosting for open source projects built in Adobe technologies. You can host your project files, Subversion, forums, blog, and issue tracker at the site, or simply just list your site if you already have an existing project site.</p>
<p>This morning the site crossed 100 active projects!</p>
<p>Along with 100 projects, we have had:</p>
<p>Total Views: 127030<br />
Total Downloads: 11715<br />
Total Verified Users: 801<br /></p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who has used the support, bugs and all. I also want to give a shout out to <a href="http://www.robgonda.com/blog/">Rob Gonda</a>, who wrote the SVN code for the site. Thanks Rob!</p>
