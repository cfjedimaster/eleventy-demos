<p>I'm looking into various accounting packages that I can use for my new business and one of things I'd like to consider is an online version. I want this because I'm going back and forth between a PC and a Mac, plus I just want something I can access from multiple locations.</p>
<p>One of the first ones I looked at was <a href="http://oe.quickbooks.com/">Quickbooks Online Edition</a>. I was all ready to try the free demo when I discovered that...</p>
<p>a) Their online edition only supports Windows operating systems.</p>
<p>b) Their online edition only supports IE.</p>
<p>I realize that still represents a sizable portion of the net, but I couldn't imagine, as a web developer, selling this to a client.</p>
