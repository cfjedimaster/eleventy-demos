<p>This is an old question, covered in hundreds of FAQs, but a reader asked me this today and I'm nothing if not responsive. (Especially when I know the answer. ;) The question was - how do you open a new window in JavaScript with as little chrome as possible. JavaScript makes this rather simple. The syntax to open a new window is:</p>
<code>
foo = window.open(url, varname, features);
</code>
<p>Where features is a list of ... well, features. This includes chrome, size, and other options. I found a good list <a href="http://www.devguru.com/Technologies/ecmaScript/quickref/win_open.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>So to answer the question - you can simply disable all the features that are chrome related like so:</p>
<code>
&lt;script&gt;
function popup() {
	var features = 'directories=no,menubar=no,status=no,titlebar=no,toolbar=no,width=500,height=500';
	var mypopup = window.open('http://ray.camdenfamily.com', 'mypopup', features);
}
&lt;/script&gt;
<p>&lt;form&gt;
&lt;input type=&quot;button&quot; onclick=&quot;popup()&quot; value=&quot;Click me, baby&quot;&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></p>
<p>In my features list I disabled directories, menubar, status, titlebar, and toolbar. Note though that status=no will not work in Firefox or IE7, due to security settings, which is probably a good thing.</p>
