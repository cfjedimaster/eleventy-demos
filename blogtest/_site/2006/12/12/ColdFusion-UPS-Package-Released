<h1>Post</h1>

<p>I'm proud to announce the release of the <a href="http://cfups.riaforge.org/">ColdFusion UPS Package</a>.  This package will serve as a simple to use interface to the UPS services. Today the service includes address verification and shipment tracking.</p>
<p>Shipment tracking returns a <b>lot</b> of information. No, seriously, it returns everything you can imagine about a shipment. The API returns a pretty big struct, but it does make it easy to get the information at least. Here is an example:</p>
<code>
&lt;cfset st = createObject("component", "org.camden.ups.shipmenttracking").init(application.key, application.username, application.password)&gt;
<p>&lt;cfset results = st.getTrackingInformation('1Z12345E0291980793')&gt;
&lt;cfdump var=&quot;#results#&quot;&gt;
</code></p>
<p>The package is 100% free and open source, so start hacking away at it and let me know if you find any bugs. (Please use the bug tracker at the RIAForge project.) As always - if you  like it, visit my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/registry/2TCL1D08EZEYE">wishlist</a>. (The poor thing has nothing purchased currently - so that can't be good!)</p>
<p>The next service I'll hit is the services and rates API.</p>
