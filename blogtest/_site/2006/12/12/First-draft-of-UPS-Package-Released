<p>Yesterday I <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2006/12/11/What-can-Brown-do-for-me-How-about-a-provide-an-easy-to-use-service">complained</a> about how much of a pain it was to get access to UPS's API service. Once I did get in - the docs weren't terribly helpful either. I was able to eventually find what I needed though early this morning. With that I'm happy to announce the initial release of the UPS Package (get it, UPS Package! I kill me).</p>
<p>Right now there are no docs and the only service I support is Address Verification. Obviously I will add to this. In order to use the code though you will need to go through the painful <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2006/12/11/What-can-Brown-do-for-me-How-about-a-provide-an-easy-to-use-service">process</a> I had to go through. I can say that once you do get your XML key and login info, it should work pretty easily. Here is a simple example:</p>
<code>
&lt;cfset av = createObject("component", "org.camden.ups.addressverification").init(application.key, application.username, application.password)&gt;
<p>&lt;cfset results = av.addressVerification(city=&quot;Lafayette&quot;, state=&quot;LA&quot;,postalcode=&quot;70508&quot;)&gt;
&lt;cfdump var=&quot;#results#&quot;&gt;
</code></p>
<p>By the way - the UPS documentation had a wonderful little gem about displaying a disclaimer in your code &quot;from time to time&quot;. I kid you not. They want you to do it every now and then. Ahem. Well, I added a getDisclaimer() service to the CFC. Use it - um - from time to time.</p>

The avtest1.cfm file is <b>not</b> going to run out of the box until you set up the right application variables.<p><a href='enclosures/D%3A%5Cwebsites%5Cdev%2Ecamdenfamily%2Ecom%5Cenclosures%2Fups%2Ezip'>Download attached file.</a></p></p>
