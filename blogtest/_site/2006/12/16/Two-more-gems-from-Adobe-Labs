<p>I don't know about you guys, but I'm beginning to think the coolest Adobe property out there now is the Labs site. First off - Adobe released a new plugin for Eclipse called <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/jseclipse/">JSEclipse</a>. As you can probably guess, this is a JavaScript plugin for Eclipse. I've got it installed and it seems pretty darn cool. My JavaScript was a bit rusty before I started playing with AJAX more and this will definitely help a lot.</p>
<p>Secondly, and this isn't new (as far as I know), there is a RSS feed for Labs. You can find the different flavors here:</p>
<p><a href="http://labs.adobe.com/rss_feeds/">Adobe Labs - RSS Feeds</a></p>
<p>One problem though - it seems to be a bit behind. Can someone at Adobe possibly look into this?</p>
<p><b>Edited:</b> By the way, don't forget that you can use <a href="http://www.rsswatcher.com">RSSWatcher</a> to monitor RSS feeds. I just added a profile for the Labs RSS feeds so I will get an email when it is updated.</p>
