<p>Let's take a quick look at three more features in <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/spry/">Spry 1.4</a>. First lets take a look at remove and addClassName. These two functions will either remove, or apply, a CSS style to an element. So consider this element:</p>
<code>
&lt;div id="test"&gt;This is the test content that will be changing.&lt;/div&gt;
</code>
<p>To apply a CSS style to this element, you can use this code:</p>
<code>
Spry.Utils.addClassName('test','someCSS');
</code>
<p>Obviously removeClassName will remove the item.</p>
<p>The last new function I'll discuss is getNodeText(). As you can probably guess, it returns the text inside an element. Using the same div above, the following code:</p>
<code>
var str = Spry.Utils.getNodeText($('test'));
</code>
<p>will set str equal to: This is the test content that will be changing.</p>
