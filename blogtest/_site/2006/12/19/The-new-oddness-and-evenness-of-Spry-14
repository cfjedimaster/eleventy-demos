<p>Ok, I'm not sure if &quot;evenness&quot; is really a word, but if Steve Colbert can make stuff up - so can I. Before Spry 1.4, Spry supported a simple way to apply different CSS styles to datasets rows to support even/odd colors. It was done using the built in variable ds_EvenOddRow. On execution, this would be replaced with even or odd. So in this example:</p>
<code>
&lt;tr spry:repeat="dsEmployees" class="{ds_EvenOddRow}"&gt;
</code>
<p>You would end up with this when the dataset was generated:</p>
<code>
&lt;tr class="even"&gt;
...
&lt;tr class="odd"&gt;
</code>
<p>If you wanted different names, you could prepend or append a value to the class like so:</p>
<code>
&lt;tr spry:repeat="dsEmployees" class="myds_{ds_EvenOddRow}"&gt;
</code>
<p>While this worked, it wasn't the cleanest method. Spry 1.4 introduces a new spry:even and spry:odd tag. This allows you to specify the class to use in each particular case. Consider this example:</p>
<code>
&lt;tr spry:repeat="dsEmployees" spry:even="even" spry:odd="odd"&gt;
</code>
<p>This ends up being the exact same as the first example, but is a bit more clear.</p>
<p>One more quick example. If you are repeating over multiple datasets, you can tell spry:even and spry:odd what dataset to check for &quot;oddness&quot;. Adobe provides an example of that.</p>
