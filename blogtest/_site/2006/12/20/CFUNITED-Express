<p>Announced today on cf-talk (and in my mailbox), Teratech is bringing CFUNITED &quot;Express&quot; (I'm guessing a one day version) to Atlanta and NYC. Details will come later.</p>
<p>I don't know about you guys - but I feel like its 1999 all over again. Now lets bring back CFSOUTH and CFNORTH!</p>
