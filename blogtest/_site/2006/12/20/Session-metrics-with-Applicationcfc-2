<h1>Post</h1>

<p>This is just a quick follow up to <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2006/12/19/Session-metrics-with-Applicationcfc">yesterday's post</a> on the session logging demo I showed.</p>
<p>First - David Crowther mentioned that I could cut two database queries down to one by just doing the insert in the onSessionEnd method. I don't think this is such a big deal - but it does make things a bit simpler so I made the change.</p>
<p>Next - Geoff made a good point. He asked if I was sure session.urltoken was unique over system reboots. Using J2EE sessions I'm pretty darn sure it is - but why take chances when ColdFusion makes it so easy to create a unique ID with createUUID()?</p>
<p>For these new suggestions I added three new session variables (id, entrypage, and entrytime), and you can find the code in the Download.</p>
<p>I also wanted to mention something else. When creating your reports, it may be useful to create a simple function to show nicer names for the URLs. So for example, your code could translate /company/about.cfm to &quot;About our Company&quot;. It could translate /company/news.cfm?id=45 to &quot;News: Adobe buys Microsoft&quot;. This will create reports that are much easier to read.</p>
<p>Thanks to David and Geoff for the good ideas!<p><a href='enclosures/D%3A%5Cwebsites%5Cdev%2Ecamdenfamily%2Ecom%5Cenclosures%2FApplication%2Ezip'>Download attached file.</a></p></p>
