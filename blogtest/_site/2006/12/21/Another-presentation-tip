<p>I just got my feedback from MAX (thanks everyone!) and someone had a great tip in there. I thought it would be a good addition to my <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2006/6/29/A-few-presentation-tips">previous post</a> on presentation tips. One of the things I mentioned was increase the size of text in your editor. One of the side effects of this is that lines now can go far off screen.</p>
<p>What I would suggest doing is this: Bump up your text size and see how many characters you can see on screen. Then go to your CFEclipse settings and enable &quot;Show Print Margin&quot;. Set the Print Margin to the number of characters you were able to see on screen at the higher font size. Then return to your normal font size and code away.</p>
<p>I believe I remember hearing that CFEclipse may include word wrap in the future - but I don't think it is in yet. (Mark - correct me if I'm wrong.)</p>
