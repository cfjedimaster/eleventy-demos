<h1>Post</h1>

<p>While I have some posts planned for next week, I will be out of the office and taking a nice vacation as I'm sure (or I hope) most folks are as well. For those who celebrate, have a Merry Christmas!</p>
<p>Today is also the day I say goodbye to roundpeg and start my new life as a <strike>bum</strike> independent consultant. I want to thank everyone who wished me luck last time as it appears to have worked out well. (Can I work 90 hours a day and still blog?)</p>
<p>Have a fun - and safe - holiday!</p>
