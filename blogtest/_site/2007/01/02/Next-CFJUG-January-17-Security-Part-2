<p>So, it has been long delayed, but I'm now officially rescheduling the next CFJUG (ColdFusion Jedi User Group) meeting. This meeting will be on Wednesday, January 17th, at 6PM Central.</p>
<p>This will be a follow up to my previous presentation on security, and will cover more details in regards to securing your applications. As a guide, I'm going to follow (most of) the bullet points mentioned on my <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/coldfusionsecuritychecklist.cfm">CF security checklist</a>.</p>
<p>Please RSVP (by leaving a comment) so I have an idea of how many people will show up. If a company would like to sponsor this meeting with a give away, let me know. (And I'm not doing this to sell out - but to have something to offer to folks as a reward for showing up to listen to my sexy voice. ;)</p>
