<p>A user reported an error to me that I've seen a few times recently. His code was doing something like this:</p>
<code>
&lt;cfset fleet = arrayAppend(fleet, "Star Destroyer: Wrath of Elmo")&gt;
</code>
<p>Later on he did...</p>
<code>
&lt;cfloop index="x" from="1" to="#arrayLen(fleet)#"&gt;
</code>
<p>His error said that he was trying to use a boolean as an array. Where did the error come from?</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The arrayAppend function, like a few other ColdFusion functions, return true or false, not the changed data structure. Personally I'm not sure why as I don't know a situation where it would return false.</p>
<p>As another reminder - for functions like these you do not need to actually store the result:</p>
<code>
&lt;cfset result = arrayAppend(heroes, "Forge")&gt;
</code>
<p>But can instead simply use a shorthand statement:</p>
<code>
&lt;cfset arrayAppend(heroes, "Forge")&gt;
</code>}
