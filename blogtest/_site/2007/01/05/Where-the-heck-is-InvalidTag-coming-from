<p>I've gotten this question many times so I thought I'd write up a quick FAQ. If you are displaying dynamic content on your ColdFusion site and see InvalidTag instead of the HTML you thought you would - it means one of two things.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Either your ColdFusion Admin has <b>Enable Global Script Protection</b> turned on or your Application has scriptProtect set to true. This would be set in either the CFAPPLICATION tag or the This scope of your Application.cfc file.</p>
<p>This is a feature that helps prevent cross-site scripting attacks. Personally I don't use this feature as I always htmlEditFormat user input before displaying it. For more information about this feature, see this page from the LiveDocs:</p>

<p>So - raise your hand if you've seen this and had no idea what it was!</p>
