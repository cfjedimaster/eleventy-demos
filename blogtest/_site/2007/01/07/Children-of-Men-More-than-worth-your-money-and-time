<p>I had the chance to see Children of Men, and while I'm not quite sure I'd call it &quot;This generation's Blade Runner&quot;, the movie is <b>darn</b> good. Just to be sure folks get it - this is <i>not</i> a science fiction film, not any more than 1984 or Brave New World. It is a rather chilling look at how quickly things can downhill when faced with an inescapable situation. Luckily we don't have to worry about losing our civil liberties over here. ;) Sly personal attack against our lovely President aside - I would strongly recommend this film.</p>
<p>On a side note - I also saw Lady in the Water. Now - I've always like Night's film, even The Village. Lady in the Water is horrible though. Almost &quot;Highlander 2&quot; horrible.</p>
