<h1>Post</h1>

<p>Sorry I've been quiet this week. I actually have a few Spry posts in mind, but I'm out of town all week doing training (Model-Glue, Spry, all kind of fun stuff). Next week I have two presentations:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>First - On Wednesday the 17th I'll be doing my CFJUG Breeze presentation on security topics. This is at 6PM Central, the &quot;Cool&quot; timezone as I call it. (I'm in EST right now and just can't get used to it. ;)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Secondly - on Thursday the 18th I'll be doing a presentation on Model-Glue to the <a href="http://www.scottishcfug.com/">Scottish CFUG</a>. I believe they promised to FTP me some good Scottish beer, so I'm looking forward to it. That presentation is at 8 GMT which is something else CST. The URL will be http://adobechats.adobe.acrobat.com/r66866989/.</p>
</li>
</ol>
