<p>I'm a bit late here - but Ryan Stewart and Jeff Houser are running a new podcast named <a href="http://www.theflexshow.com/blog/">The Flex Show</a>, obviously discussing Flex development. You can load up the podcast in iTunes by clicking <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=212654258">here</a>. They have released one episode already with a new one being released soon.</p>
