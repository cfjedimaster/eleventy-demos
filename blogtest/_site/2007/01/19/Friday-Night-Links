<p>Two quick links I thought I'd share. First Kevin Schmidt has a blog now: <a href="http://flexinabox.com/">&lt;blog:FlexInABox&gt;</a>. He  describes his blog as covering Flex and ColdFusion, which as you can guess is a favorite topic of mine so I'd definitely recommend it.</p>
<p>Secondly, Dan Wilson has started a Model-Glue blog series:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nodans.com/index.cfm/2007/1/19/So-you-want-to-create-a-ModelGlueUnity-application--Part-1-">So you want to create a ModelGlue:Unity application? ( Part 1 )</a></p>
<p>His series covers Model-Glue 2 while <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/downloads/mgapp.zip">my series</a> had covered Model-Glue 1.</p>
