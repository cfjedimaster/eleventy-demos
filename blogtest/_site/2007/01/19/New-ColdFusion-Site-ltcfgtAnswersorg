<p>Kevin Cox has launched a new web site, <a href="http://www.cfanswers.org/">&lt;cf&gt;Answers.org</a>. The site is based on the Yahoo Answers concept but focused exclusively on ColdFusion questions. Kevin mentioned the site is still in somewhat of a &quot;beta&quot; stage (hey, if Google can stay in beta, we all can!) so check it out and see if you can help contribute. I'll be adding to this the <a href="http://www.coldfusionportal.org">portal</a> in a minute.</p>
