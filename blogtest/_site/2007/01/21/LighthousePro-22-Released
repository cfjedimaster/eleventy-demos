<h1>Post</h1>

<p>Today I put the finishing touches on <a href="http://lighthousepro.riaforge.org/">Lighthouse 2.2</a>, my ColdFusion based bug tracker. It was more fun that watching my Saints lose. (Although they did try very hard!) Changes in this version include:</p>
<!--more-->
<ul>
<li>First off - many changes were done by Qasim Rasheed. Thanks Qasim!
<li>Support for Oracle. This was done by renaming the tables to not conflict with Oracle. There isn't a install script yet, but you should be able to copy the structure from SQL Server and run it just fine on Oracle. (Thanks Qasim.)
<li>You can supply a username/password for your dsn. (Thanks Qasim.)
<li>Improvements to how CFCs are passed around. (Thanks Qasim.)
<li>Issue Types are now editable. In the past your issues were one of two types: Bug or Enhancement. Now you can make as many issue types as you want. 
<li>Slight changes to the PDF creation. You now get a properly named file and the display is a tiny bit different.
<li>LighthousePro is now cooking with AJAX, baby! Spry specifically. This will be especially useful for projects with large numbers of issues.
</ul>
<p>You can download the <a href="http://lighthousepro.riaforge.org">latest version</a> from RIAForge (which is also going to have a nice update later this week).</p>
<p>The next version of LighthousePro will have integrated email checking. You will be able to point a project to a mail server account and then have it automatically create bug reports based on mails sent to the account. This lets you &quot;open up&quot; LHP to the world by simply creating an email address for your bug reports.</p>
<p>As always, LHP is free. If you find it useful, please visit my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/registry/2TCL1D08EZEYE">wish list</a>.</p>
