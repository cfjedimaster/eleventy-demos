<p>So, a few hours ago I <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2007/1/21/Setting-the-disabled-property-of-a-form-field-help-needed">posted</a> about an odd JavaScript issue I was having where I couldn't set a field's disabled property. Turns out it was an issue with Spry, and one that makes sense if you think of it. My code was doing something like so:</p>
<code>
if(offset == 0) $("prevbutton").disabled=true;
else $("prevbutton").disabled=false; 
<p>if((offset + pageSize) &gt;= numRows) $(&quot;nextbutton&quot;).disabled=true;
else $(&quot;nextbutton&quot;).disabled=false;</p>
<p>Spry.Data.updateRegion(&quot;issues&quot;);
</code></p>
<p>This code was run anytime you would click the Previous or Next buttons. It was a basic page handler for my dataset. The updateRegion call basically redrew the region. I had code inside it to check and see if a row should be displayed:</p>
<code>
&lt;tr spry:repeat="dsIssues" spry:even="adminList0" spry:odd="adminList1" spry:test="{ds_RowNumber} &gt;= pageOffset &amp;&amp; {ds_RowNumber} &lt; pageStop"&gt;
</code>
<p>The problem came up due to the fact that I had this inside the region:</p>
<code>
&lt;input type="button" id="prevbutton" value="Prev" onclick="UpdatePage(pageOffset - pageSize);" disabled="true"&gt;
</code>
<p>I had the previous button disabled at first since, obviously, you start on the first page. However, when I ran the updateRegion command, Spry essentially &quot;reloaded&quot; my initial HTML, which means the disabled=true was also being rerun.</p>
<p>Obvious. But of course - most bugs are (after you fix them).</p>
