<p>Has anyone ever seen a case where you can't use JavaScript to  change the disabled property of a form field? I've used this exact same code elsewhere but for some reason it isn't working for me. I get no error, but the property never gets updated. Here is the JavaScript I'm using:</p>
<code>
if(offset == 0) { alert('set it to disble');$("prevbutton").disabled=true;}
else { $("prevbutton").disabled=false; 
}
</code>
<p>To be sure I wasn't doing anything stupid, I did alert $(&quot;prevbutton&quot;) to confirm it was an input field. I also alerted the disabled status and it correctly said true for this button:</p>
<code>
&lt;input type="button" id="prevbutton" value="Prev" onclick="UpdatePage(pageOffset - pageSize);" /&gt;
</code>
<p>As I said - I get no error at all - but it is almost like the button's disabled field is readonly when it should be read/write.</p>
