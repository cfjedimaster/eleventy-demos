<p>Last month I wrote an <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2006/12/11/FlashVars-in-Flex">article</a> about how to use FlashVars in a Flex application. FlashVars are simple values passed in to the Flash movie from the HTML/JavaScript that embeds the SWF. I thought I'd follow it up with a practical example on an application I'm working on right now.</p>

<p>I'm building an administrator interface for a web site. This application will make use of Flash Remoting to talk to a CFC. The path to the CFC isn't hard coded though. To make matters worse, my dev environment isn't exactly like production. Therefore, the &quot;dot path&quot; location of the CFC needs to be dynamic. I decided to pass in the path via FlashVars.</p>
<p>I had things working on the Flex side, hard coded, so the first thing I did was to remove the source attribute from my RemoteObject tag:</p>
<code>
&lt;mx:RemoteObject id="core" destination="ColdFusion" showBusyCursor="true" &gt;
</code>
<p>My Flex code was already running code on creationComplete:</p>
<code>
&lt;mx:VBox xmlns:mx="http://www.adobe.com/2006/mxml" width="100%" height="100%" xmlns:views="views.*" creationComplete="init()" &gt;
</code>
<p>So I simply updated my init() function:</p>
<code>
private var componentroot:String = "";
<p>private function init():void {
componentroot = this.parameters.componentroot;
core.source = componentroot + &quot;components.admin&quot;;
}	
</code></p>
<p>As I mentioned in the <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2006/12/11/FlashVars-in-Flex">previous entry</a>, the data from the FlashVars is available as this.parameters.<i>name</i>, where <i>name</i> is the FlashVar name.</p>
<p>So how do I test this? One of the cool things about FlexBuilder is that you can modify the HTML generated when you view your application. I went into the html-template folder, opened up index.template.html, and changed this line:</p>
<code>
"flashvars",'historyUrl=history.htm%3F&lconid=' + lc_id + '',
</code>
<p>To this:</p>
<p><code>			&quot;flashvars&quot;,'componentroot=secretproject.server.&amp;historyUrl=history.htm%3F&amp;lconid=' + lc_id + '',
</code></p>
<p>This isn't the final step though. I'm deploying to a site running ColdFusion. I'll eventually change my index.html file to an index.cfm file and use an Application variable for the component root.</p>
<p>So now I have a problem. The this.parameters structure only exists for the core Flex file of an application, not the children. How can I get my children to also use the value? I'm thinking what I'll do is pass the value from parent to child, since that is relatively easy to do. I could make the child run code to grab it from the parent, but that is such a pain to do. (More on that later.) I don't want to have to create a custom even just to read a simple value from the parent. (But that may just be me being lazy. :)</p>
