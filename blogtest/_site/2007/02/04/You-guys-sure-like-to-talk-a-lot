<p>I thought I'd point out a new stat being added to the next release of BlogCFC. (Which is a minor update - containing small fixes here and there over the past few weeks.) I've added a <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/stats.cfm#topcommenters">Top Commenters</a> table which shows a list of the top ten people based on the number of comments they make. The stat is based purely on email address so if you used multiple addresses, you are out of luck. This could be a very useful stat for people who want to find out more about their community.</p>
