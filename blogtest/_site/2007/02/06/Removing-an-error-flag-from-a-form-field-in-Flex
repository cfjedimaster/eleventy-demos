<p>Today I ran into a situation where I needed to clear the error flag from a form field in Flex. My code uses a datagrid to present a list of items to edit. You could click to edit an item, or click an Add button to add a new item.</p>

<p>I ran into a problem though. If I clicked to edit a field, hit cancel, and then hit Add, I was seeing the values from the previous edit in the form field. Well that was easy enough. I added this to my cancel operation:</p>
<code>
username.text = '';
password.text = '';
firstname.text = '';
lastname.text = '';
email.text = '';
</code>
<p>This worked, but when I returned to add an item, the form was displaying red borders around each field. My code to set the form items to empty strings was also triggering the form validation.</p>
<p>I did a bit of looking around in the API and couldn't find a simple way to &quot;reset&quot; the validators I had applied to my form. Turns out I found a solution on Adobe: <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/quickstart/validating_data/">Flex Quick Starts: Validating Data</a>.</p>
<p>Turns out you can manually change a property on the text field. If you set errorString to an empty string, the red &quot;You messed up&quot; border goes away:</p>
<code>
username.text = '';
username.errorString = '';
password.text = '';
password.errorString = '';
firstname.text = '';
firstname.errorString = '';
lastname.text = '';
lastname.errorString = '';
email.text = '';
email.errorString = '';
</code>
<p>Feels a little hackish to me. Anyone know a nicer way?</p>
