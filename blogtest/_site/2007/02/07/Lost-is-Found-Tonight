<p>Don't forget that Lost returns tonight. The first episode (8 CST) looks to be a recap show, with the real first episode at  9 CST. The rest of the season will all be new shows with no repeats. The question is - can Lost reclaim the throne of top geek show away from Heroes and Battlestar Galactica?</p>
