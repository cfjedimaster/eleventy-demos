<p>I've seen this a few times in the past, but I just ran into it so I thought I'd share my feelings on it.</p>
<p>If you have a query that contains one row that you are using for an edit form, you should not do:</p>
<code>
&lt;cfoutput query="getDetail"&gt;
</code>
<p>While your page will work just fine, it simply isn't the proper user of the tag. (And before I go on - I'll note that this is my opinion only.) When you tie a query to a cfoutput tag, you are telling ColdFusion to iterate over each item of the query.</p>
<p>If your intent is to work a single database record (again, think of an edit form), then don't use what is - essentially - a looping construct.</p>
<p>As it stands, for a developer just entering the project (like me!), you can cause confusion over what the template is actually meant to do.</p>
