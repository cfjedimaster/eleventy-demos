<p>I blogged about the cool new toy Google released (<a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2006/10/24/Custom-Google-Search-Engines">Custom Google Search Enginees</a>) a few months back. At that time, <a href="http://www.cfhunt.com">CF Hunt</a> was released using  this engine. Now there is another one, <a href="http://www.cfsearchengine.com/">CFSearchEngine.com</a>.</p>
<p>Sorry for the slow blogging so far this week. I spent the day yesterday in Las Vegas meeting with a client so I'm a bit behind on the &quot;paying&quot; work. (For some reason no one hasn't offered me a job to just write open source applications and blog all day. ;) In case folks are curious - I had 4 flights. All were on time. No luggage was brought since I wasn't spending the night. But just to make things fun I got to fly home through a severe thunderstorm.</p>
