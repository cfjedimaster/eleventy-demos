<p>I want to send a big thank you to everyone who filled out the forms for my presentation at the Frameworks Conference (and for those not attending - thanks for your comments on the blog).</p>
<p>Yesterday the folks at <a href="http://www.teratech.com/">Teratech</a> sent out the speaker scores and the rankings. I have to admit I always get a little nervous when I look at these things. My ego is about as fragile as Windows 95. I was a bit surprised to find I came out in 8th place.</p>
<p>Then I took a second look. The top 9 speakers at the conference all had scores of 19.00 or higher. Thats on a 1 to 20 scale. If that doesn't speak to the quality of the presenters I don't know what does. I'm <i>more</i> than proud to be in the top ten of that group! (Of course, now that I've gotten Highlander on DVD, I may have to hunt down the guys above me!)</p>
