<p>I missed this by a few days, but on February 12nd I passed four years of blogging. In that time I've written <strike>1834</strike>1835 blog entries (of which 1800 are about Lost), had 14250 comments, and 1521571 blog entry views. (Although I only started counting when BlogCFC started to support it.)</p>
