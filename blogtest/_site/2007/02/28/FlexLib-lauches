<p>Doug McCune (I think that is his last name - why don't bloggers have a 'Who Am I' page?) has <a href="http://dougmccune.com/blog/2007/02/28/announcing-flexlib-open-source-flex-component-library/">announced</a> the launch of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/flexlib/">FlexLib</a> - a collection of Flex 2 components - all open source and free for use. I've wanted to build such a site for a while but I'm glad folks didn't wait for my lazy rear to get to it. The repository already has a good set of components for folks to use.</p>
