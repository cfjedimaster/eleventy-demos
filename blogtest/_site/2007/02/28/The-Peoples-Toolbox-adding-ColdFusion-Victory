<p>Ok - so &quot;Victory&quot; may seem a bit overly dramatic, but as I have decided that I am on a crusade, I'm going to be dramatic if it helps the cause - spreading the word of ColdFusion.</p>
<p>Taylor Hayward posted a <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2007/2/27/Make-this-the-last-year-someone-doesnt-know-what-ColdFusion-is#c0828C924-A42D-0AB6-CFB11DE6A9345FAA">comment</a> in response to my entry asking for help convincing him to include ColdFusion on his site. He has agreed to it. Each and everyone of you out there who helped here - <b>thank you</b>. But now we need to follow that up with submissions. He is going to wait till he has 40 good submissions, which is reasonable, before adding the category.</p>
<p>So now your job is to help find him some good content. I'll be doing the same (after I get my kids out the door and to school).</p>
<p>I've said it before and I'll say it again. I am <b>not</b> going to just ignore it anymore when I see a site not list ColdFusion. Now if I can only get Yahoo to add a ColdFusion Developer Center...</p>
