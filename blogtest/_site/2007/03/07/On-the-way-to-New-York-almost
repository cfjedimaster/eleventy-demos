<p>Just a quick note to let folks know I'll be out of the office today and tomorrow as I travel to <a href="http://cfunitedexpress.com/go/">CFUNITED Express</a>. For those wondering about my &quot;travel curse&quot;, I'm sitting here in Baton Rouge waiting because of mechanical issues with the plane. In my mind - discovering mechanical issues on the ground is a heck of a lot nicer than finding issues in the air. In theory - I may actually make it to NYC on time as well so I can't really complain.</p>
