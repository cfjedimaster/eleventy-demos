<p>Ok, I don't mean that to brag - but the response has been just a <i>tiny</i> but overwhelming. Thank you everyone for both your encouragement and your bug reports. I just wanted to let folks know that Adam and I are working on a pretty massive rewrite. The main issue we ran into was fat XML. I knew the XML was fat - but it became apparent with real testing that the XML was &quot;Fat Bastard&quot; style fat. XML is out and the younger, fresher, hipper JSON is now being used. Another mod we may make is to switch to how FirePHP sends the data - in a <a href="http://www.firephp.org/Reference/Specifications/Protocol.htm">multipart</a> document.</p>
<p>In general I'm going to blog at <a href="http://coldfire.riaforge.org/blog">ColdFire's blog</a>, but I wanted to drop a quick note here.</p>
<p>P.S. The logo was designed by Dave Hill. It isn't 100% confirmed yet - but I like it.<p><a href='enclosures/D%3A%5Cwebsites%5Cdev%2Ecamdenfamily%2Ecom%5Cenclosures%2Fcoldfire%5Fdes1%2Egif'>Download attached file.</a></p></p>
