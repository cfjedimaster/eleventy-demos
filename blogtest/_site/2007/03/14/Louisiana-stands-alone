<p>So I'm a day or two late on this, but with New Mexico banning cock fighting, Louisiana is now the only state in the Union to allow cock fighting. Lovely. I was sent a few good articles on the subject, and I'll list them here.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17584419/site/newsweek/?GT1=9145">How New Mexico Banned Cockfighting</a></p>
<p>A truly sad quote from the article:</p>
<blockquote>
"This has been one of our dirty secrets for a long time, and quite frankly, this [ban] has been a long time coming," said Democratic State Rep. Peter Wirth. "I'm thrilled that we're finally putting Louisiana in the rear-view mirror on this issue."

<p>A good editorial on the subject, and gives you a bit of background on why it has been hard to ban it here.</p>
