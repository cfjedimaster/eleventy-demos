<p>Yesterday I was doing some training and my student asked me to explain the logic behind this code:</p>
<code>
&lt;cfif 1&gt;
 &lt;cfdump var="#dharma#"&gt;
&lt;/cfif&gt;
</code>
<p>It was something so obvious to me that it never occurred to me that it may be confusing, and looking at it with a fresh eye I can definitely see it doesn't make much sense. Here is the method behind my madness...</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Laziness. We've all had cases where we are working on a page and we need to quickly add some debug code to a page. Typically we just type it in like so:</p>
<code>
&lt;cfdump var="#dharma#"&gt;
</code>
<p>Then if we want to hide it, but we know we aren't quite done yet, we replace it with this:</p>
<code>
&lt;!---
&lt;cfdump var="#dharma#"&gt;
---&gt;
</code>
<p>So now to go back and forth we can add and remove the CFML comments. Well I'm lazy. I pride myself on my laziness. I don't want to have to add/remove CFML comments. Plus I tend to typo that particular set of code. So I will often use the cfif 1 code instead. When I want to hide it, I switch to:</p>
<code>
&lt;cfif 0&gt;
 &lt;cfdump var="#dharma#"&gt;
&lt;/cfif&gt;
</code>
<p>In case folks don't get what the 1 and 0 means, they are shorthand for true and false. ColdFusion considers any non-zero number to be true.</p>
