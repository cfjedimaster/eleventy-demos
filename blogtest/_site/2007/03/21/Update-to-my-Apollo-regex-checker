<p>I love you guys so much that I spent my lunch not just watching the Young and the Restless, but also improving my ugly little Apollo Regex Checker. (Ok, so I <i>did</i> watch Y and R while I coded.)</p>
<p>This new version now uses HTML mark up to show your matches, and lets you toggle between one match and multiple matches.</p>
<p>I have to say I really went down the wrong path trying to get my regex working right. Turns out there was a much simpler way to mark up the matches. This is my new AS code:</p>
<code>
private function testRegex():void {
	var regexStr:String = regex.text;
	var bodyStr:String = body.text;
	var options:String = "";
<pre><code>if(regexStr == '' || bodyStr == '') {
	mx.controls.Alert.show(&quot;Please enter a regex and a body.&quot;);
	return;
}

if(global.selected) options = &quot;g&quot;;
	
var regexOb:RegExp = new RegExp(regexStr,options);

//any matches?
if(!regexOb.test(bodyStr)) return;

body.htmlText = bodyStr.replace(regexOb,&quot;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;$&amp;&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&quot;);
</code></pre>
<p>}		
</code></p>
<p>Next will be a version that lets you test replacements as well.</p>
<p>By the way - Apollo notices if you run the same AIR twice. It asks you if you want to replace the old version. Sweet.<p><a href='enclosures/D%3A%5Cwebsites%5Cdev%2Ecamdenfamily%2Ecom%5Cenclosures%2Fregex1%2Ezip'>Download attached file.</a></p></p>
