<p>According to <a href="http://www.flashmagazine.com">Flashmagazine</a>, who are reporting from WebDU, there will be a <a href="http://www.flashmagazine.com/1384.htm">public beta</a> of ColdFusion 8. This is not surprising considering how open Adobe has been lately with their beta products. The article also mentioned possible hosting solutions for folks who don't have the hardware to run ColdFusion.</p>
<p>The article also talks about the inclusion of FCKEditor in CF8 and new PDF abilities (imagine that).</p>
