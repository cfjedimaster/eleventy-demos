<p>For the third time in less than a year I'm off to Las Vegas. Last time it was MAX. Now I'm heading out to meet with a client and help them out with a redesign of their web site. I don't gamble, but I love the desert and I'm looking forward to seeing it again. Of course, this means it is time to play &quot;What will happen to Ray on the Plane&quot; again. Something tells me this will be a perfect flight. I've already gotten an earlier flight from Lafayette and am on stand by for an earlier flight to LV as well.</p>
