<p>So my readers who care about this probably already know, but Microsoft has announced the <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2007/03/28/the-xbox-360-elite-is-official-hdmi-and-120gb-for-479/">XBox 360 Elite</a>. Major features are a 120 gig hard drive, HDMI, and a black color scheme. The price is a bit steep (479), but if all you want is the hard drive you can buy that by itself.</p>
<p>So - um - anyone want to trade 2 hours of quality consulting and training?</p>
