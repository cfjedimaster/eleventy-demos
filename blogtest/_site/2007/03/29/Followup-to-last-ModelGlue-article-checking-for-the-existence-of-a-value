<h1>Post</h1>

<p>In my <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2007/3/27/Interesting-ModelGlue-Feature-to-watch-out-for">last article</a>, I talked about what I considered to be an odd side effect of using getValue on the event object. I really should have told folks how you can check for the existence of a value without actually doing the get. In other words, if all you want to do is see if the value exists, you should do this:</p>
<code>
&lt;cfif arguments.event.valueExists("dharma")&gt;
</code>
<p>As opposed to getting it and checking if it is equal to &quot;&quot;. Of course, if you are building a form, then you need to do both, since it is possible then the value <i>will</i> exist and be blank.</p>
<code>
&lt;cfif arguments.event.valueExists("dharma") and arguments.event.getValue("dharma") neq ""&gt;
</code>
<p>Something to keep in mind, and while I don't like this strange behavour of getValue, I'll definitely not forget now.</p>
<p>p.s. The ViewState has a similar API, but it uses viewState.exists() instead.</p>
