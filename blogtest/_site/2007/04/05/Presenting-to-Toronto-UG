<p>All I can say is thank God for Breeze. I've been able to present at UGs across the world all without leaving my little piece of heaven here in Louisiana. And since you all know what happens when I travel, that is a Good Thing(tm). On April 11th, I'll be presenting to the <a href="http://www.cfugtoronto.org/">Toronto ColdFusion User Group</a> at (around) 6:30 CST. This will be my Spry presentation again, so most likely my readers here have seen it, but if you haven't, the meetings breeze URL is: <a href="http://adobechats.adobe.acrobat.com/cfugtorontoapril2007/">http://adobechats.adobe.acrobat.com/cfugtorontoapril2007/</a></p>
