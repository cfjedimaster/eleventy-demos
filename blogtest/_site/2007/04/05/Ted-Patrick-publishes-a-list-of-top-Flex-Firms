<p>Need to hire someone for Flex development? (Outside of me... when I'm free... which isn't now of course ;) Ted Patrick, Adobe Flex Evangelist, <a href="http://www.onflex.org/ted/2007/04/q1-2007-top-flex-firms.php">posted</a> a list of top Flex firms out there. As Ted says on his blog, this isn't an official &quot;Adobe-list&quot; of preferred companies, but simply a personal list of who he sees out there leading the pack. (Makes me wonder if we need such a list for ColdFusion as well. That <i>couldn't</i> lead to any controversy, could it?)</p>
