<p>Well, I just lost an email I had been working on for the past 2 hours due to one second power outage. (Louisiana's power grid is made of swiss cheese.) Can someone recommend a good UPS?</p>
<p>p.s. And yes, Thunderbird <i>does</i> have an auto-save option. I would have assumed it was turned on by default. Guess what - it isn't. :)</p>
