<h1>Post</h1>

<p>This is a big update that covers lots of bug fixes and adds Scott Pinkston's excellent Pod Manager. (In Microsoft terms, I &quot;innovated&quot; his code into the core product.) For more details, see the <a href="http://www.blogcfc.com/index.cfm/2007/4/13/BlogCFC-57-Released">entry</a> at <a href="http://www.blogcfc.com">BlogCFC.com</a>. Yes - my own blog is now <i>way</i> old. When I finally get moved to the new server I'll update then. When I find time. And unicorns, WMDs, and a proper diet.</p>
