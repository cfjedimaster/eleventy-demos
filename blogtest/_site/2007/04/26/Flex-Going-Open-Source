<p>Last night while the world slept (ok, most American timezones), Adobe announced that they were <a href="http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pressreleases/200704/042607Flex.html">open sourcing Flex</a>. Once again the Labs site is being used to host information:</p>
<p><a href="http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Flex:Open_Source">http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Flex:Open_Source</a></p>
<p>There you will find a a pretty lengthy <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Flex_Open_Source_FAQ">faq</a> about their move to open source as well. Hopefully we will see this up on <a href="http://www.riaforge.org">RIAForge!</a></p>
