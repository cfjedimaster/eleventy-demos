<p>Today's puzzle is pretty simple, but I'm curious to see how people solve it. Write a UDF that takes two arguments. The first argument is a set - and by that I mean a list of possible values. So a set could be: A,B,C. The second argument is the length of a string to generate. So given: arrResults = func(&quot;A,B,C&quot;,2) the result would be an array of every possible string combination. Like so:</p>
<code>
AA
AB
AC
BA
BB
BC
CA
CB
CC
</code>
<p>Good luck!</p>
