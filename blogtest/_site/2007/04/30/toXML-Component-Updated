<h1>Post</h1>

<p>As I don't have a <a href="http://www.riaforge.org">RIAForge</a> project for it, I thought I'd folks know that <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/projects/toxml/">toXML</a>, my CF to XML component, had an update today. I added a simple attribute to all the converters to let you return the XML without the XML header tag. This is useful for times when you want to add the XML to another existing XML string.</p>
<p>Why don't I have it up on RIAForge? I'm trying to avoid CFCs on RIAForge as <a href="http://www.cflib.org">CFLib</a> will be supporting them shortly.</p>
