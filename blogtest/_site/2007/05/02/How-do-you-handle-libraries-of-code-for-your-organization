<p>Open question - no right answer - a reader emailed me this morning with an interesting question. He wants to ensure his organization is properly reusing code. He needs a library to store custom tags, CFCs, and even non-ColdFusion stuff like SQL statements, etc.</p>
<p>What are folks using as a generic code library? Again - think of something that would be useful outside of just one project.</p>
<p>Personally I <i>don't</i> have a solution. I use <a href="http://www.cflib.org">CFLib</a> as my own personal library, but as a company of one person (oh, wait, I now have a subcontractor so I'm twice as big!), that works just for me.</p>
