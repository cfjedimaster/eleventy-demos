<p>Pardon the important Scoprio/CF posts for a minute while I update my readers on the oh so important issue of cock fighting. A LA House Panel is now proposing to end cock fighting in 2008. KATC, one of the local channels, has <a href="http://www.katc.com/global/story.asp?s=6467290">more info</a>. The House committee wants to give the poor trainer/cock fighters time to find new careers. Bah. I'm sure these people are highly qualified and will have no trouble finding other excellent jobs.</p>
