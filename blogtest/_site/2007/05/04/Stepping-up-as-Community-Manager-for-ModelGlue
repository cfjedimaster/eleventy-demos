<p>Joe just <a href="http://www.firemoss.com/blog/index.cfm?mode=entry&entry=58C1CC0C-3048-55C9-4310C06A39AA2293">posted</a> it to his blog so I won't repeat it entirely here, but I'm stepping up to serve as a Community Manager for the <a href="http://www.model-glue.com">Model-Glue</a> project. Joe seems to think I like this whole community/blog thing. Bah, I just like the wishlist items! All kidding aside, I hope to help the framework continue to evolve and improve. Nuff said.</p>
