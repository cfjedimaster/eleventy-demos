<p>The subject says it all. There will be a debugger for ColdFusion in Eclipse. Includes step through debugging, access to variables, and breakpoints. (As before, I'm posting now and will be editing as he speaks. Email subscribers please visit the live site.)</p>
<p>So you can set up multiple connections to servers. When done, hit debug and you enter the debug perspective. It creates a connection to CF and waits for debugging to start. Ben alt-tabs back to the browser, reloads a page, and shows the breakpoint firing in Eclipse.</p>
<p>You can see the output generated by CF before the breakpoint. You can see the variables as well. He showed adding a watch expression (ie, look for a variable), and it is empty at first, but as he steps through, you see the variable populate.</p>
