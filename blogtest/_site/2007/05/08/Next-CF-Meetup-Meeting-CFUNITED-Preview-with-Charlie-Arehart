<p>The next meeting of the CF Meetup user group will be held on May 10th, 2007 at 12:30 PM. Charlie Arehart will give a preview of his session at CFUNITED on features you may have missed in CFMX6 and 7.</p>
<p>Trust me - you are not using everything you could be in CF. (I include myself in this group.)</p>
<p>For more information, and to RSVP, go to the <a href="http://coldfusion.meetup.com/17/calendar/5756012/">event detail</a>.</p>
<p>As a reminder - this is completely free for anyone and everyone.</p>
