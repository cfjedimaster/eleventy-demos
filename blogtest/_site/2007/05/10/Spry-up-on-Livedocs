<p>While you can't see a link from the Livedocs homepage, Spry now has it's <a href="http://livedocs.adobe.com/en_US/Spry/1.4/">documentation</a> available at Livedocs. I'm assuming this is part of the support for Spry in Dreamweaver. (Which I'm hoping to evaluate this week. I'll be curious to see how quickly DWMX launches on my new Mac.)</p>
