<p>Andy asks:</p>
<blockquote>
What directories under CFIDE should be blocked/protected from public access on a public ColdFusion server?  Is only
preventing access to CFIDE/administrator good enough?  How about CFIDE/adminapi? Any others that should be blocked?  I tried searching the Adobe website, but I could only turn up a note regarding ColdFusion 4 and 4.5!

<p>I'm pretty surprised by the fact that this hasn't been updated lately. I took a quick look at <a href="http://livedocs.adobe.com/coldfusion/7">Livedocs</a>, but didn't see anything that related to this.</p>
<p>I haven't done this myself in a while (I admit it - I'm lazy), but I'd think you would want to lock down these subfolders:</p>
<p>administrator<br>
adminapi<br>
classes (no need for folks to browse it)<br>
componentutils<br></p>
<p>So I'm with you on administrator and adminapi. I mention classes and componentutils because there is no need for them to be visible anyway. But you can probablyg et away with just locking down the first two.</p>
<p>Any comments on this?</p>
