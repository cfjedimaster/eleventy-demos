<p>Slawko (why do my readers always seem to have cool names?) asks an interesting question about Client and Session storage:</p>
<blockquote>
My question is in regards to Sessions.  I think I'm being misslead by a colleague.  My understanding is that Sessions are stored in Server's memory (RAM), and by default timeout is 20 min.  Now there is a setting option in the coldfusion server admin that lets you specify settings for Client Variables. 
<p>This is the part that creates much confusion.  My colleague has set the client variables to recod into a database and says that all the sessions are being stored in that database.  Could you please be so kind and explain if that is really the case or am I being misslead.  What is really happening with the sessions and client variables settings, and what is really the industry standard, if that makes sense.</p>

<p>So a few things here. I'll try to tackle each one:</p>

<p><b>My understanding is that Sessions are stored in Server's memory (RAM)</b></p>
<p>This is correct.</p>
<p><b>Now there is a setting option in the coldfusion server admin that lets you specify settings for Client Variables.</b></p>
<p>Correct. You can set settings for Application, Session, and Client variables.</p>
<p><b>My colleague has set the client variables to recod into a database and says that all the sessions are being stored in that database.</b></p>
<p>Incorrect. Client variables <i>can</i> be stored in a database. They can also be stored in the Registry (ick, don't do this) or simple cookie variables. Session data is always stored in RAM.</p>
<p><b>What is really happening with the sessions and client variables settings, and what is really the industry standard, if that makes sense.</b></p>
<p>In general, the ColdFusion Administrator lets you specify the same things for Session and Application variables:</p>
<p>a) Are they allowed at all<br />
b) What default timeout should be used<br />
c) What is the max timeout that can be used<br /></p>
<p>Client variables are a bit different. You have options to enable new client variable databases. You have an option to set the default. Lastly - you can tell ColdFusion how often it should clean up the client databases and remove old information.</p>
<p>Now for your big one: <b>What is the industry standard?</b></p>
<p>It is important to remember that the whole concept of a session (note the use of lowercase, when I say Session I'm referring to the ColdFusion scope) is rather nebulous since HTTP just doesn't support it. In general I'd say the commonly accepted view is that a session is:</p>
<p>A collection of requests confined to one unique visitor in a certain period of time.</p>
<p>In other words - we take one unique user (which is a browser, not a human), look at his requests, and if he doesn't hit us for N minutes, we consider the next request to be a new session.</p>
<p>So with that basic idea in place, every language has it's own way of handling it. Being primarily a ColdFusion guy, I can't speak to how PHP and .Net handles it. I do remember that sessions in PHP seemed a bit hacky, but that was a <b>long</b> time ago when I looked last. (Just trying to hold off the PHP Horde.) If folks want to comment on how it compares, please do.</p>
<p>If I missed anything Slawko, let me know!</p>
