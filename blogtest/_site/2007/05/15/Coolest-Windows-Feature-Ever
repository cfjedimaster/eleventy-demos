<p>I have to say - the Windows feature that I love the most is the one where - you want to copy about 50 gigs of files so you start the process at night and then you wake up in the morning with Windows asking you if you want to move a read only file, because, I mean, lord forbid you move a read only file, that would be like, crazy, and then you say &quot;Ok&quot;, check back a few hours later and see that it has done about 5 more files and is now asking you if you want to move a system file.</p>
<p>Yeah, I love that.</p>
<p>(Ok, rant over.)</p>
