<p>Yesterday I was helping a ColdFusion user who is just getting into Flex. He kept getting this error:</p>
<code>
[RPC Fault faultString="[MessagingError message='Unknown destination
'Coldfusion'.']" faultCode="InvokeFailed" faultDetail="Couldn't establish a
connection to 'Coldfusion'"]
</code>
<p>This was his first attempt trying to hook Flex 2 into ColdFusion and he wasn't getting anywhere. His code looked ok to me:</p>
<code>
&lt;mx:RemoteObject id="cfService" destination="Coldfusion"
source="flexbtb.cfc.myService" /&gt;
</code>
<p>But then I noticed something. He had &quot;Cold<b>f</b>usion&quot;, not &quot;ColdFusion&quot;. Turns out the destination value is case sensitive. Just one more example of something us ColdFusion developers have probably gotten a bit lazy with - case sensitivity.</p>
