<h1>Post</h1>

<p>Ok, so after posting a few puzzles that were, um, not quite simple, I thought it would be nice to post something that you actually could solve rather quickly. This one is <b>very</b> simple, and I almost didn't post it, but I have a soft spot for string parsing (I started my web dev life in Perl) so I thought this could be fun.</p>

<p>You are a newly employed member of the CIA. Your job is to help catch dumb spies using an encryption technique where the first letter of every line is a message. What do I mean? Consider this letter:</p>
<blockquote>
Berry told me he had lost his<br />
umbrella last night when<br /> 
sailing with his friends.<br />
<br />
He really is kind of stupid.<br /> 
Really. I mean, how dumb<br /> 
of a person do you have to be to<br /> 
collapse on a moving bock and hurt your<br />
knees while<br /> 
sailing?<br />

<p>In case it isn't obvious, read down the first column of letters and you will see &quot;BushRocks&quot;. Yes, I'm joking, but after all the times I teased him I figured my (poor) Republican readers needed a break. ;)</p>
<p>So your task is to simply parse a string and get the first column of letters.</p>
