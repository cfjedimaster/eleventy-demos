<p>So for the last 10 minutes or so I've been struggling with why Model-Glue was throwing an error about events. I have a controller that checks the value of &quot;event&quot; in the ViewState. This contains the name of the currently running event. For some reason, when I did one particular action, I got an error saying that the value of the event wasn't a simple value.</p>
<p>This certainly didn't make any kind of sense. Event <i>had</i> to be a simple value - otherwise - how would Model-Glue know what to run?</p>
<p>Turns out I was working on event editing (event as in calendar events). I had a line of code that did this:</p>
<code>
&lt;cfset arguments.event.setValue("event", createObject("component", "exchange.model.eventbean"))&gt;
</code>
<p>Yeah, um, not such a good idea. In case folks are curious, read <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2006/6/2/ModelGlue-What-is-reserved-in-the-view-state">this blog entry</a> for a list of reserved words in Model-Glue.</p>
