<p>Just a quick note to let folks know that Scott Mebberson has <a href="http://scottmebberson.wordpress.com/2007/05/22/riaforge-project-lists-as-rss/ ">posted</a> a cool article on how to convert the RIAForge XML feed into an RSS feed. The XML feed he is talking about is the XML feed I provide to developers for their own projects. RIAForge does have RSS feeds for the main set of projects and on a per-category basis.</p>
