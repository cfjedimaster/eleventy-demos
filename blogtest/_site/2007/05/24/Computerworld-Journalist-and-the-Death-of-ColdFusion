<p>-sigh- Do we really have to go through this again? Do computer journalists actually - you know - work with computers? Mary Brandel of Computerword posted this interesting article:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&articleId=9020942&pageNumber=1">The top 10 dead (or dying) computer skills</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=printArticleBasic&articleId=9020942">Print version - much fewer ads</a></p>
<p>I'll quote from the ColdFusion section:</p>
<blockquote>
This once-popular Web programming language -- released in the mid-1990s by Allaire Corp. (which was later purchased by Macromedia Inc., which itself was acquired by Adobe Systems Inc.) -- has since been superseded by other development platforms, including Microsoft Corp.'s Active Server Pages and .Net, as well as Java, Ruby on Rails, Python, PHP and other open-source languages.
</blockquote>
<p>This is so wrong it makes my head hurt. I mean - I can see how people may prefer PHP over my beloved CF. But to say these languages have superseded them shows that she knows nothing about what the language actually supports.</p>
<p>Anyway - guys - time to rally the troops and reply. There is a comment form for the article and folks are already stepping up to defend CF. <b>Remember</b> - we are <b>not</b> fanboys (and girls). Be polite. Be logical. But let your voice be heard.</p>
