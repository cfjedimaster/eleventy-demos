<p>Check out Ben Forta's <a href="http://www.forta.com/blog/index.cfm/2007/5/25/Todays-Irresponsible-Journalism-Award-Goes-To-Mary-Brandel">response</a> to the ComputerWorld article. What I find most interesting is that the company that publishes ComputerWorld is refusing to answer Adobe's attempt to even tell them about Scorpio. Nice! (Please respond on Ben's blog, not on this entry.)</p>
