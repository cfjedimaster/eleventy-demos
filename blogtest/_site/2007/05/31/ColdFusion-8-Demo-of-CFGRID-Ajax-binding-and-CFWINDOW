So I plan to spend time later on talking more about the Ajax work in ColdFusion 8, but I thought I'd share a demo I whipped up for Ben a few weeks back. This demo integrates with Yahoo's Traffic service using my <a href="http://cfyahoo.riaforge.org">CFYahoo</a> library. Simply enter a zip, hit Go, and the grid will populate with traffic data. When you select a row, I then use a map to show you information about the traffic hot spot. 
<p>All of the &quot;magic&quot; can be seen in one line:</p>
<code>
&lt;cfinput type="text" name="zip" /&gt;
<p>&lt;cfgrid name=&quot;reportsGrid&quot; format=&quot;html&quot; pageSize=&quot;5&quot; stripeRows=&quot;true&quot; 			bind=&quot;cfc:yahooProxy.getTraffic({cfgridpage},{cfgridpagesize},{cfgridsortcolumn},{cfgridsortdirection},{zip})&quot;&gt;
</code></p>
<p>The bind attribute tells ColdFusion to speak to my CFC and use the results for the data.</p>
<p>The code is available below. To run this, be sure to download  the CFYahoo package first. And yes - I <b>was</b> trying to be artsy with my design here. Normally I'm not allowed to design anything. ;)</p>
<p>And yes - I hope to have everything up and running on CF8 here soon.<p><a href='enclosures/D%3A%5Cwebsites%5Cdev%2Ecamdenfamily%2Ecom%5Cenclosures%2Ftraffic1%2Ezip'>Download attached file.</a></p></p>
