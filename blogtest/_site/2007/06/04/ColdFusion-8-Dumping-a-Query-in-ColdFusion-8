<p>So a small change - but a nice one. If you dump a query in ColdFusion 8, you now get a set of additional information along with the data. You get...</p>
<ul>
<li>Whether or not the query was cached
<li>The execution time
<li>And best of all - the SQL!
<li>Lastly - if your SQL contained any cfqueryparam tags, there will be a SQLParameters key that is an array of the values used in the cfqueryparam tags.
</ul>
<p><b>Edited to add last bullet point.</b></p>
