<p>This is just a quick note to point out the new url for my site:</p>
<p>http://www.raymondcamden.com</p>
<p>All old URLs should work. If you see any that do not, let me know. Now I just sit back and wait to get sued by Lucasarts. (Maybe if I show them <a href="http://www.coldfusionjedi.com/index.cfm/2007/4/23/What-I-did-this-weekend">this</a> they will back off...)</p>
<p>Oh - and I'm rocking on ColdFusion 8 baby.</p>
<p>p.s. And I'm finally actually running a modern version of <a href="http://www.blogcfc.com">BlogCFC</a> as well. In fact, this one has a modification the released one doesn't. (But I hope to get into source soon.)</p>
