<h1>Post</h1>

<p>I've gotten a lot of emails over the past day or so, but didn't want to post anything until I saw something more official. Now it looks like it really is. CBS has ordered <a href="http://jerichoboard.cbs.com/n/pfx/forum.aspx?tsn=1&nav=messages&webtag=CBSMBJericho&tid=13329">seven more episodes</a> and is open to the idea of more. It even looks like they are going to do other things to promote the show too. (If I were the ungrateful snarky type, I'd suggest that they maybe consider <b>not</b> putting a show on hold for a few weeks and complaining when viewership drops, but that wouldn't be like me at all.)</p>
