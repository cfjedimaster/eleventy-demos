<p>Adobe is on a roll lately. First a late night launch of ColdFusion 8, now we have new versions (and a new name!) of Adobe AIR (formally Apollo) and Flex 3.</p>
<p><a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/air/">Adobe Integrated Runtime (AIR)</a> (I love this technology, but boy do I wish they had kept the old name. Right now it sounds as cool as TPS forms!)</p>
<p><a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/flex/">Flex 3</a></p>
<p>If you haven't looked at either of these technologies yet, you are really missing out. Do yourself a favor and check them out now!</p>
