<p>I love this. So I assume most folks knew about the result attribute added to cfquery in ColdFusion 7. If not - you are missing out. It returns quite a bit of good information about your query. But best of all - it was updated in ColdFusion 8.</p>

<p>Have you ever inserted a record into a table that used an autonumber primary key? I bet you wanted a nice way to get the value of that ID? In SQL Server it is possible with a bit of extra SQL. MySQL - I'm not so sure. But as you can imagine - any solution you pick won't be very cross platform. This is the main reason I use UUIDs in my OS apps.</p>
<p>The good news is that in ColdFusion 8, the result struct will contain a new key that contains the ID of the row you just inserted. The key is different for each support DB. SQL Server returns a key named IDENTITYCOL. MySQL returns GENERATED_KEY. Other database types have their own names - but lets focus on MySQL. Here is the query I used:</p>
<code>
&lt;cfquery datasource="test" result="result"&gt;
insert into test(name)
values('George Bush')
&lt;/cfquery&gt;
</code>
<p>Now when I dump the result, I get:</p>

<p>Pretty handy!</p>
