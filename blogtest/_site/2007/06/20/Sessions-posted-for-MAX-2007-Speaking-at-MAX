<p>The <a href="http://adobemax2007.com/na/sessions/">sessions</a> have bee posted for MAX 2007, including the one I'm speaking on:</p>
<blockquote>
Working With Data Feeds<br />
Skill: Advanced ColdFusion<br />
<br />
RSS, ATOM, XML data feeds -- modern applications leverage all these and more to provide content syndication and distribution. In this session, you'll learn how ColdFusion 8 makes working with feeds easy and fun.
</blockquote>
<p>For some reason I'm not listed on the <a href="http://adobemax2007.com/na/speakers/">speaker list</a>, but I'm sure that is just a temporary issue. (And yes, I already bugged the right people. ;)</p>
<p>There are almost 30 sessions on ColdFusion which is great to see. I plan on spending most of my time in the AIR sessions.</p>
