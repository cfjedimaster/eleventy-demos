<p>The Spry Team launched a new preview today: <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/spry/preview/">Tooltips</a>. I'm feeling a bit lazy today so I won't go into too much detail, but the link above will show you both examples and documentation. I have to say I really like how they did this. It is fairly simple to setup and I love the use of effects. Here is a quick demo I did:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/demos/tooltipdemo/">http://www.coldfusionjedi.com/demos/tooltipdemo/</a></p>
<p>Like most other Spry widgets, the basic work flow is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create your items (in this case, you have one item for the tooltip and one item that launches the tooltip)
<li>Use a line of JavaScript to "turn on" the widget
</ul>
<p>I'll let you view source on the demo to see how little code was involved.</p>
