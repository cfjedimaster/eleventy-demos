<h1>Post</h1>

<p>So with me wrapping up work here and packing for CFUNITED, I probably won't be doing any posts that are - you know - actually worth your time reading. But if you are truly bored and want to hear something a bit funny - read on.</p>
<p>I've always heard that the U.S. Government is a big ColdFusion user. For some odd reason - one day last week - one afternoon last week actually - I got a flurry of emails from folks asking for help. (As a reminder, you can <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/contact.cfm">ask for help</a> as well.)</p>
<p>By some odd coincidence, the domains of these users were:</p>
<blockquote>
nasa.gov
pentagon.af.mil
nih.gov
uscourts.gov
</blockquote>
<p>This was all in one afternoon, in the span of about 2-3 hours. I have to be honest and say as a sci-fi geek, the NASA one makes me the most happy. NASA could ask me to pick up naval lint from the space station and I'd be happy to pay them to do it!</p>
