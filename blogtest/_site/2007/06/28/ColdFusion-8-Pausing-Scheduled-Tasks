<p>This is a short entry for a simple feature that I know folks have been asking for for a long time. Did you know that in ColdFusion 8 - you can now pause and resume scheduled tasks? In the past you had to either delete the task or change the URL to something else. Now all you need to do is click a pretty little button in the admin:</p>

<p>The second icon in this screen shot is the pause control. Click it and it will switch to a resume control.</p>
<p>I missed this feature even though I thought I had read the release notes carefully.</p>
