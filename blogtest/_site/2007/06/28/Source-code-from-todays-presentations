<h1>Post</h1>

<p>Sorry for the delay folks (it is technically tomorrow, although my body is still on CST). Attached to this blog entry is one big zip with all the code from my presentations today, including the Paris Hilton CFIMAGE work that I unfortunately didn't get to show off.</p>
<p>This zip contains source code and Powerpoint/PDF slides from my CFC and CFIMAGE presentation. Enjoy. I'm also more than willing to get the CFIMAGE presentation again to a user group out there looking to fill a meeting.</p>
<p>Sorry folks. I submitted the blog post last night and went to bed. It timed out with the slow as heck network connection here.<p><a href='enclosures/C%3A%5Chosts%5Cwww%2Ecoldfusionjedi%2Ecom%5Cenclosures%2Fpresos%2Ezip'>Download attached file.</a></p></p>
