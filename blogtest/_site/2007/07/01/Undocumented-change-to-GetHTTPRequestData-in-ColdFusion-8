<p>Daniel Budde pointed out to me a <a href="http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/webforums/forum/messageview.cfm?catid=648&threadid=1280872">thread</a>  over at the Adobe forums that discusses an undocumented (as far as I know) change to GetHTTPRequestData. In the past, if you uploaded a file, the content key of the result of GetHTTPRequestData would contain the binary data of the file uploaded. Adobe made the decision to remove this support as it had a negative impact on server performance when a large file was uploaded. Again, see the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/webforums/forum/messageview.cfm?catid=648&threadid=1280872">thread</a> for more details. Personally it seems like a smart choice by Adobe.</p>
