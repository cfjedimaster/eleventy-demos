<p>I'm working alongside my client today (well, &quot;alongside&quot; as in virtually on the net) when he pings me with an odd error. His template allows you to sort a set of data by selecting a value from a drop down. Whenever he picks Published Year as the sort, he would get a very odd error:</p>
<blockquote>
Error casting an object of type to an incompatible type. This usually indicates a programming error in Java, although it could also mean you have tried to use a foreign object in a different way than it was designed.
</blockquote>
<p>The SQL in question was extremely simple:</p>
<code>
&lt;cfquery name="foo" dbtype="query"&gt;
select * 
from   tempquery
order by #foter.sorter#
&lt;/cfquery&gt;
</code>
<p>Now ignore for a moment the select * and possibly unsafe order by. Instead note that this is a query of query. One of the first things I check for in cases like this is ColdFusion getting confused by the column type. When you create a query by hand (temp query was made with query new), and you then later perform a query of query on it, ColdFusion has to guess at what your column types are. It looks at the first few rows and makes assumptions based on what it sees.</p>
<p>However - you can stop ColdFusion from guessing. If you read the <a href="http://www.cfquickdocs.com/?getDoc=QueryNew">docs on QueryNew()</a>, you will see that it takes a second argument. This argument is a list of column types that correspond to the initial list of columns in the first argument.</p>
<p>I had him add this list and the error went away.</p>
