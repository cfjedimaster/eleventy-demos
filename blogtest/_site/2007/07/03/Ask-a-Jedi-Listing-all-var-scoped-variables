<p>Dale asks about var scoped variables:</p>
<blockquote>
I think the answer is no, but it seems strange. All
variables go into a scope somehow.
<p>But if I declare 5 variables as var within a function, coldfusion knows that they are only for that function, but how can I get to them? Is it possible to dump all var variables for a given function? Where are they hiding, are they a struct withing some other scope.</p>
<p>If I dump all the scopes, variables, this, sesssion etc would they simply not exist.</p>
<p>I normally use &lt;cfset var local = structNew() /&gt;</p>
<p>Which gets around this, but really wondering where the variables live.</p>

<p>You are correct. Var scoped variables are &quot;special&quot; and currently there is no way to enumerate them in ColdFusion. That is exactly why some people use a local struct as you have described above. Yes, ColdFusion does know about them, and yes, it is a bit odd that they don't have a proper scope, unlike every single other variable out there.</p>
<p>Personally I don't like using a struct for my var scoped variables. It just seems like too much to type. Of course the flip side is that I'm typing more var scopes. I also kind of like seeing the var scope lines as it helps remind me what is going on inside my function.</p>
