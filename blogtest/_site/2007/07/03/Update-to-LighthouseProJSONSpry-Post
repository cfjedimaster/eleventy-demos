<h1>Post</h1>

<p>Yesterday I <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2007/7/2/Case-Study--Moving-to-Spry-15-and-JSON-for-Lighthouse-Pro">blogged</a> about how I moved <a href="http://lighthousepro.riaforge.org">Lighthouse Pro</a> over to JSON using CFJSON and Spry. In general it worked nice and gave me some size savings on the data, but I had run into one problem.</p>
<p>The format of the data returned from CFJSON wasn't working right with Spry. I had to tell CFJSON to return it's data in &quot;array&quot; format. This gave me data that looked like so (and by the way, this is borrowed from the Spry docs that I'll be linking to in a moment):</p>
<code>
{
  "data":
  [
    { "firstname": "John", "lastname": "Smith", "id": "3001" },
    { "firstname": "Jane", "lastname": "Doe",   "id": "4532" },
    { "firstname": "Ann",  "lastname": "Hunt",  "id": "5462" }
  ]
}
</code>
<p>Turns out though - that Spry had built in support for the default way that CFJSON returned cfqueries. Why? The default way CFJSON returns queries is actually even smaller. Consider this version:</p>
<code>
{
  "data":
  {
    "firstname": [ "John",  "Jane", "Ann"  ],
    "lastname":  [ "Smith", "Doe",  "Hunt" ]
    "id":        [ "3001",  "4532", "5462" ]
  }
}
</code>
<p>Notice that the main change is the columns are not repeated.  In order for Spry to work with this form, I simply had to add a new attribute to my JSONDataSet creation:</p>
<code>
var dsIssues = new Spry.Data.JSONDataSet("issuesxml.cfm?id=#p.getID()#&stupid=#rand("SHA1PRNG")#",{path:"data", pathIsObjectOfArrays: true});
</code>
<p>Note specifically the pathIsObjectOfArray attribute.</p>
<p>Ok - so why is this a big deal? Well as I mentioned in the last post, I had hoped the savings in size would be a bit better. For my 300 issue project I went from 130k to 90k. Guess what the size was for this alternate version? 40k. Now <b>that</b> is a nice savings.</p>
<p>For more information on the options concerning JSON datasets in Spry, see <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/spry/articles/data_api/apis/json_dataset.html#constructor">this page</a>. Thanks go to Kin Blas of Adobe for pointing this out to me. (And Lighthouse Pro users will see this in the zip later today.)</p>
