<p>Mark Drew has updated CFEclipse to support Eclipse 3.3. See his <a href="http://www.markdrew.co.uk/blog/index.cfm/2007/7/4/CFEclipse-1315-now-for-Eclipse-33">announcement</a>. I'm using it right now and it seems to be working fine. I installed Aptana, and AIR, but have only tested basic HTML work.</p>
