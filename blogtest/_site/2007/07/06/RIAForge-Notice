<h1>Post</h1>

<p>So I've been talking about the RIAForge move for a few weeks now, but tonight is the night it finally happens. You can expect the site to be down around 8 CST and (hopefully) back up around midnight or so. To be clear, it won't be down so much as just DNS being updated. This will/should fix the Subversion problems people are having, and the screen shot issue. (If you aren't a project owner, that will probably mean nothing to you.)</p>
<p>The good news is that once I've actually gotten everything moved over, I can finally turn to adding <b>new</b> features to RIAForge. All in my copious free time of course.</p>
