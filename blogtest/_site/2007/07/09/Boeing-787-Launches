<p>Ok, so I don't normally blog about Flash, but I noticed quite a few posts on MXNA today about the new Boeing 787 web site and how it uses Flash. The Flash part is nice and all, but I'm a real nut for airplanes so I encourage folks to check it out:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newairplane.com/">Boeing's New Airplane</a></p>
<p>The coolest feature? Well, the coolest looking feature? Check out the video of the dimming windows. Nice.</p>
<p>If I can make one comment on the Flash, the site was well done and all, very slick, I just wish there was a mute on the front page video. I hate it when sites do audio and don't give you a mute option. The other portions of the site do have audio controls at least. I'm still waiting for Adobe to add a mute control to Flash for cases where the developers forget.</p>
