<p>I'm a bit late on this, and I wasn't even aware it was coming up, but apparently today is ColdFusion's 12th birthday. Not bad for a technology that has been on it's death bed for the past few years. (And yes, that's sarcasm in case any ComputerWorld &quot;journalists&quot; are reading.)</p>
<p>My first experience with ColdFusion was around 95 or 96 I believe. I had been doing all my web applications in Perl before that. (I still have a great deal of respect for Perl. I once spent a few months at Netscape where my entire job was working on one Perl script meant to facilitate a web site update.) I had been doing my &quot;database&quot; work in flat text files. (Scary, I know.) The web shop I worked for (Einstein Digital Media) got a client that needed a &quot;real&quot; database, so I picked up ColdFusion (3. something I believe) to see how easy it would be. That was the first time I used ColdFusion, and the last time I used anything else. (Ok, so I did play some with JSPs, ASP, and PHP.)</p>
<p>How about you? What was your first experience with ColdFusion?</p>
