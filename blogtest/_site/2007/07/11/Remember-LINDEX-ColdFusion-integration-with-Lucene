<p>A <i>long</i> time ago, back on DRK 3(*), there was a project released called Lindex. This was a ColdFusion wrapper to the open source Lucene search engine.</p>
<p>If you are the author of this code, or know the name of the person who developed this code, please contact me. I do not need a copy of the code - I've got that. I need to find the author.</p>
<ul>
<li>Don't know what the DRK is? Macromedia used to sell what was called a Developer Resource Kit. This was a CD with code for various technologies. Stuff like Galleon, Lighthouse Pro, Soundings, and other projects were born there. Sadly the DRK series was discontinued.</li>
