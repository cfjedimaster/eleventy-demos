<p>While working on some bugs in the CFLib SnipEx server, Mark Drew sent me a great tip on how to clear the cache in CFEclipse. Right now it is a manual process, but Mark will be adding a refresh option to the UI soon. So to clear your SnipEx cache, drop down to the command line and....</p>
<ol>
<li>Change to your Eclipse workspace. Mine was at /Users/ray/Documents/workspace
<li>Change to .metadata/.plugins/org.cfeclipse.cfml/snipex
<li>Delete all XML files
<li>Restart Eclipse
</ol>
<p>That's it. During development it makes sense to just keep a window open there so you can do this a bit more quicker. (By development I mean if you are working on your own SnipEx server.)</p>
<p>So CFLib has had some issues with SnipEx, mainly with UDFs that don't work well in the XML feed. I've been removing the UDFs temporarily and this morning I just removed another another one. If you have trouble loading a library, please clear your cache first, then try again, and let me know.</p>
<p>p.s. Now that I've got a nice XML version of CFLib, my next &quot;for fun&quot; project will be an AIR client for CFLib!</p>
