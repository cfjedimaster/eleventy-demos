<p>Ok, I know I tend to rave a bit about how fast ColdFusion 8 is - but I was a bit shocked today. Last night I had an idea and I somehow forced myself to <b>not</b> jump out of bed and code. Instead I worked on it when I woke up this morning. I'm not going to talk a lot about the idea yet - but it involved parsing a whole heck of a lot of RSS feeds. How many? 292. I pointed <a href="http://paragator.riaforge.org/">Paragator</a> at it and let it rip. How long did it take for ColdFusion to parse all 292 RSS feeds? Around 47 seconds. Not bad. I'll be sharing the code for my little project shortly.</p>
