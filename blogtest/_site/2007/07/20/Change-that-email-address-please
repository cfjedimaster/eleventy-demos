<p>Would the person running a copy of my aggregator (from <a href="http://www.coldfusionbloggers.org">ColdFusion Bloggers</a>) please do me a favor and update your onError code to <b>not</b> email me? Thanks. I woke up with 100+ emails from you. I know you are on a Mac and that you saved the code in a folder under webroot named &quot;aggregator&quot;, but that's it. The next time I zip up the code I'll need to remove my email address I guess. ;)</p>
