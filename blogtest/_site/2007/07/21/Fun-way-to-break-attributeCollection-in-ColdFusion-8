<p>Ok, so I love the new attributeCollection feature of ColdFusion 8. Here is a simple example:</p>
<code>
&lt;cfset s = {url="http://cnn.com", result="result"}&gt;
&lt;cfhttp attributeCollection="#s#"&gt;
</code>
<p>But for the heck of it, I tried something a bit crazy:</p>
<code>
&lt;cfset s = {url="http://cnn.com", result="result"}&gt;
<p>&lt;cfset s.attributeCollection=structNew()&gt;
&lt;cfhttp attributeCollection=&quot;#s#&quot;&gt;
</code></p>
<p>I wasn't sure what it would do. My guess is that it would apply attributeCollection as an attribute and complain that it wasn't valid. Or I thought maybe it work recursively. Well, not sure if &quot;recursive&quot; is right - but I thought it would apply the top level struct as attributes, then <i>reapply</i> the empty attributeCollection struct.</p>
<p>Nope - it just throws a JRun Servlet Error. So a total waste of time - but I thought I'd share.</p>
