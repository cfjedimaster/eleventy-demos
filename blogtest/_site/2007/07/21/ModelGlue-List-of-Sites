<p>I'm working on composing a list of sites using Model-Glue for the <a href="http://www.model-glue.com">Model-Glue</a> web site. Please help. Use the comments form below to note the web site you built with Model-Glue. If the site is internal, that is fine. Please follow this format:</p>
<p>Name of Site
URL (again, you can ignore this if it is internal)
Basic Summary (and I mean basic, 1-2 lines)</p>
