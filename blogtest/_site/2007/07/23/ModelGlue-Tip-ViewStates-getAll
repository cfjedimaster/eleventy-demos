<p>I was just talking to Todd and helping him a bit with some ModelGlue development. He was talking about doing some testing of ViewState values. I mentioned he should use the getAll()  method of the viewState. If you want to quickly see what is available in a view, just drop this line in:</p>
<code>
&lt;cfdump var="#viewState.getAll()#" label="The Whole Enchilada"&gt;
</code>
<p>I use this all the time when working on a Model-Glue site.</p>
