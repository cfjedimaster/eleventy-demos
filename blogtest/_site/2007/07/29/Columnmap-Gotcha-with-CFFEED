<p>I ran into this bug a week or so ago and just helped a user who ran into the same problem. When providing a query to CFFEED to generate an RSS string, you can provide alias information in the form of a columnMap structure. Basically it is a way to tell ColdFusion that column X maps to property Y of the RSS feed. If you try to use this feature though you will probably run into a bug. Consider this code from <a hrref="http://www.coldfusionbloggers.org">ColdFusionBloggers</a>'s RSS feed:</p>
<code>
&lt;cfset items = application.entries.getEntries(1,url.max)&gt;
&lt;cfset props = {version="rss_2.0",title="coldfusionBloggers.org Feed",link="http://www.coldfusionbloggers.org",description="Feed of the latest items aggregated."}&gt;
&lt;cfset cmap = {publisheddate = "posted", rsslink = "url" }&gt;
<p>&lt;cfset items = items.entries&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;cffeed action=&quot;create&quot; properties=&quot;#props#&quot; columnMap=&quot;#cmap#&quot; query=&quot;#items#&quot; xmlVar=&quot;result&quot;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;cfcontent type=&quot;text/xml&quot; reset=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;cfoutput&gt;#result#&lt;/cfoutput&gt;
</code></p>
<p>The variable cmap is my columnMap structure. When I tried this it didn't work and threw an error:</p>
<blockquote>
The query attribute input does not contain any column by the name of url.
<p>There is a problem in the column mappings specified in the columnMap structure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Turns out that the columnMap structure will only work if you use upper case. So I switched around my structure to look like so:</p>
<code>
&lt;cfset cmap = {publisheddate = "POSTED", rsslink = "URL" }&gt;
</code>}
