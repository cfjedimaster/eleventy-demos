<p>Did I miss something? I went to look at <a href="http://livedocs.adobe.com">Livedocs</a> today and when I did, was routed to the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/support/documentation/">Help Resource Center</a>. I picked ColdFusion and ended up here: <a href="http://www.adobe.com/support/documentation/en/coldfusion/">ColdFusion Documentation</a>. This then had a link to Livedocs which led me back to the Help Resource Center.</p>
<p>Are Livedocs gone now?</p>
