<p>I believe Mark Drew may have blogged this a while ago, but <a href="http://www.aquafold.com/">Aquafold</a> sent me a free license for Aqua Data Studio this weekend. They want folks to know that if you do open source development, they will be happy to share a license with you which I think is pretty cool! Their product is available on all platforms and is my primary database development tool now.</p>
