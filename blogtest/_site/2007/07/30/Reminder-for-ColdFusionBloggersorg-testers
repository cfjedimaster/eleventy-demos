<p>I blogged about this a week or so ago, but if you download the <a href="http://www.coldfusionbloggers.org">ColdFusionBloggers</a> code base, <b>please</b> change the email address in Application.cfc. I guess this is my fault for zipping it up, but this morning I got 1000 (yes, 1000) error emails from someone who didn't set it up right. I've got a filter on my email now, but I'd sure love it if you could fix this.</p>
<p>The user is a Mac user, and installed it here:</p>
<p>/Library/WebServer/Documents/aggregator</p>
<p>So, um, get right on that. Please. Thank you.</p>
