<p>Thanks to Todd Sharp, I discovered I made a pretty dumb mistake on <a href="http://www.coldfusionbloggers.org">ColdFusionBloggers.org</a>. I almost didn't blog this as it is so much a beginners type mistake, but if I forgot, I figured other people can to. (That's me - making dumb mistakes so you guys look smarter. You're welcome! ;)</p>
<p>If you go to the site and go to the 2nd or 3rd page, you will see an entry title: Bold Text and Opacity Issue. Then every entry below that will look faded.</p>
<p>Why? I forgot one of the basic rules. When displaying content that could have HTML embedded in it, you need to use <a href="http://www.cfquickdocs.com/?getDoc=HTMLEditFormat">htmlEditFormat</a>.</p>
<p>Nice one there, Ray. Anyway, I'll leave the bug in there for another hour or so before I fix it. In case it's fixed before you read this, here is a screen shot. (Someone save this and post it to my site next time my ego gets away with me.)</p>
