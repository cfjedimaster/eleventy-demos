<p>The Onion breaks the sad news - <a href="http://www.theonion.com/content/news/activision_reports_sluggish_sales">Activision Reports Sluggish Sales For Sousaphone Hero</a>. This is especially sad to me as a former sousaphone player. You see - I was fat(er) as a kid, and for some reason, the fat kids played the tuba and the sousaphone. I actually got quite good at it - which considering it had 3 knobs (or whatever they were), thats not saying much. I have to say - I love the graph comparing Guitar Hero versus Sousaphone Hero:</p>

<p>All kidding aside - if this were a real game - I'm nerd enough to actually want to try it.</p>
