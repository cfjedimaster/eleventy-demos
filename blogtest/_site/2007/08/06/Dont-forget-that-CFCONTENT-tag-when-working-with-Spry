<h1>Post</h1>

<p>Just a reminder - a friend of mine went through an hour of banding his head against the wall when a Spry example worked fine in IE6 and Firefox, but not the lovely IE7. Turned out that IE7 was being more demanding on the content type. He had forgotten to add:</p>
<code>
&lt;cfcontent type="text/xml"&gt;
</code>
<p>IE7 decided that since the content type wasn't set right, it would just plain ignore the result. Awesome.</p>
<p>As a tip - this friend was using Model-Glue. When I do Ajax stuff in Model-Glue, I normally route all my events to an event handler just for XML events. This event works a lot like a normal &quot;template&quot; event, except this time the template is for XML. It basically does:</p>
<code>
&lt;cfset content = viewState.getValue("content"&gt;
&lt;cfcontent type="text/xml" reset="true"&gt;&lt;cfoutput&gt;#content#&lt;/cfoutput&gt;
</code>}
