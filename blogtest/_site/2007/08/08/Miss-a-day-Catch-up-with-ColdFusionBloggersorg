<h1>Post</h1>

<p>Tonight I added a big new feature to <a href="http://www.coldfusionbloggers.org">ColdFusionBloggers.org</a> - email subscriptions. You can now register for the site and subscribe to:</p>
<ul>
<li>A daily email that contains every entry added during the day, up to 100.
<li>A daily email of the top 10 entries based on clicks.
</ul>
<p>Now if you miss a day you can get an email report of all the blog entries that were aggregated. Or if you just want to see what was &quot;hot&quot; - you can see the most popular entries.</p>
<p>This is just the initial feature. Next will be a custom keyword search. This will be checked once an hour for blog entries that match your keywords. You will be able to create any number of keyword alerts.</p>
<p>So that's the front end. Tomorrow I'll blog a bit about the code behind it, specifically the tabs and forms, as I think they work well but it took a little bit of work to get it just right. As an FYI, the code.zip file was <b>not</b> updated yet.</p>
