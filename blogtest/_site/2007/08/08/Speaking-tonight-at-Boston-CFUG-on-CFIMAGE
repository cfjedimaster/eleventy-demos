<p>Tonight I'll be speaking at the <a href="http://www.bostoncfug.org/">Boston CFUG</a> on the new CFIMAGE feature in ColdFusion 8. This is a repeat of my presentation at CFUNITED, so if you missed that, you are welcome to attend. The <strike>Breeze</strike>Connect URL is:</p>

<p>Brian said everyone is welcome to attend as long as they visit the wish list. Seriously. He said that. Kinda.</p>
<p>If you can't attend, I'm sure it will be recorded and posted to the <a href="http://www.bostoncfug.org/">CFUG site</a>.</p>
