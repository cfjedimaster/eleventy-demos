<p>Tonight, at 8 Central, is the launch of the new <a href="http://www.scifi.com/flashgordon/">Flash Gordon</a> on the Sci Fi channel. I've got hopes for this one. The Battlestar Galatica relaunch was superb, so I think one could have a chance as well, especially if they keep some of the &quot;camp&quot; from the movie. (And yes, I'm about to load the Queen song now.)</p>
