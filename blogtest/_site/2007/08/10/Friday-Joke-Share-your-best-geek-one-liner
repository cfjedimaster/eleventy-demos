<p>So I'm not actually in a joking mood today. In fact, I'm in about as foul of a mood as I can be, but since I don't want to talk about it yet, I figure a distraction might be nice. A few days ago I was talking to a friend and shared what I thought was a pretty darn funny.</p>
<p>&quot;You had me at ++&quot;</p>
<p>So on reflection, it may not be as funny as I thought it was (aren't we all a lot more funnier in our own minds?), but can someone beat this? The rule is simple - it has to be one line (one phrase) and has to have some kind of geek reference to it.</p>
