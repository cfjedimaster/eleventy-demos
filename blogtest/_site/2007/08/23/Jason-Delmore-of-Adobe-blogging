<p>As the title says, Jason Delmore, Product Manager for ColdFusion, is now blogging: <a href="http://www.cfinsider.com/">CFInsider</a>. CFInsider is an appropriate name. This is the guy you want to bug for feature ideas and other suggestions! (Like getSession, onClientStart/End, onServerStart/End, etc. ;)</p>
