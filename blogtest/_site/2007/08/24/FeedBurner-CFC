<p>I've been using FeedBurner for quite sometime now to host my RSS feeds, and when they bought Blogbeat, I was even happier since Blogbeat was a great blog-stats tool. Now I get both feed and general item stats all from one source. FeedBurner has an API to retrieve information about your stats so I decided to wrap up some of the API into a nice little CFC. FeedBurner.cfc supports getting both general feed data as well as item data. For example:</p>
<code>
&lt;cfset fb = createObject("component", "feedburner")&gt;
&lt;cfdump var="#fb.getFeedData('RaymondCamdensColdFusionBlog')#" label="No date, will be yesterday"&gt;
</code>
<p>This will retrieve the most current stats from the API, which will be yesterday. To get a week of data:</p>
<code>
&lt;cfset date = dateAdd("d", -8, now())&gt;
&lt;cfset last7 = fb.getFeedData(uri='RaymondCamdensColdFusionBlog',dateBegin=date)&gt; 
&lt;cfdump var="#last7#" label="7 Days of Info"&gt;
</code>
<p>And finally last month:</p>
<code>
&lt;cfset date = dateAdd("m", -1, now())&gt;
&lt;cfset dateBegin = createDate(year(date), month(date), 1)&gt;
&lt;cfset dateEnd = createDate(year(date), month(date), daysInMonth(date))&gt;
<p>&lt;cfset lastm = fb.getFeedData(uri='RaymondCamdensColdFusionBlog',dateBegin=dateBegin,dateEnd=dateEnd)&gt;
&lt;cfdump var=&quot;#lastm#&quot; label=&quot;Last Month&quot;&gt;
</code></p>
<p>This data then can easily be dumped into a chart:</p>

<p>Here is a live <a href="http://www.coldfusionjedi.com/demos/fbdemo/test.cfm">demo</a>.</p>
<p>Along with general feed stats you can get information about individual URLs and their stats over time:</p>
<code>
&lt;cfdump var="#fb.getItemData('RaymondCamdensColdFusionBlog')#" label="No date, will be yesterday"&gt;
<p>&lt;cfset date = dateAdd(&quot;d&quot;, -8, now())&gt;
&lt;cfset last7 = fb.getItemData(uri='RaymondCamdensColdFusionBlog',dateBegin=date)&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;cfquery name=&quot;getTop&quot; dbtype=&quot;query&quot;&gt;
select	sum(clickthroughs) as ctsum, sum(itemviews) as itsum, downloads, title, url
from last7
group by url, title, downloads
order by itsum desc, ctsum desc
&lt;/cfquery&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;cfdump var=&quot;#getTop#&quot; top=&quot;100&quot;&gt;
</code></p>
<p>This code shows first getting data from yesterday and getting last week. I then do a query of query so I can find my top entries. If you want to see a live dump of this, please visit this <a href="http://www.coldfusionjedi.com/demos/fbdemo/test2.cfm">demo</a>.</p>
<p>The CFC, along with sample code, is attached below. A warning first though before you download - and a funny story. FeedBurner gives you nice control over the dates you can retrieve when fetching data. On a whim I was testing a date range of today to 1900. Yes, 1900. And the API worked. Well, technically it worked too well - I couldn't get it to retrieve as it took to long. I then switched to 1990 and yep - it fed me stats.</p>
<p>Now for the fun part - apparently my site had a few downloads in 1990. Back when I was a Junior in high school (and I was the coolest kid at my high school, seriously). I'm assuming this is a bug... but it's certainly an odd bug.</p>
<p>Another bug is that my item stats for yesterday appear to be randomly returning no records at times. If I had to guess, I'd say they have a cluster and one machine is fetching old data.</p>
<p>Anyway - I've posted to their forums on both issues. Let me know if you find this useful.<p><a href='enclosures/D%3A%5Chosts%5Cwww%2Ecoldfusionjedi%2Ecom%5Cenclosures%2Ffeedburnercfc2%2Ezip'>Download attached file.</a></p></p>
