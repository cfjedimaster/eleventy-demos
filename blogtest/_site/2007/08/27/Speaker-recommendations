<p>So my Altec Lansing THX speakers which lasted 10 years seem to be dead. The LCD is blinking and the power button refuses to turn the speakers off. And of course - no sound is coming out. I've double checked the connections, rebooted, and unplugged/replugged in the speaker/subwoofer, but I think they have gone off to the speaker graveyard in the sky. 10 years is pretty good so I'm not too disappointed, but I'm going crazy without hearing my tunes.</p>
<p>Can someone recommend a brand name I can pick up at my local Best Buy/Circuit City? My old set were fully surround sound with a subwoofer, even THX certified, but to be honest, I really don't need anything high end. Just something nice and simple.</p>
<p>p.s. And before someone recommends me opening up the old speakers - please remember I'm a hardware wuss. ;)</p>
