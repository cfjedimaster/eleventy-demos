<p>I'll be speaking at the 9/30 <a href="http://express.cfunited.com/go/chicago/2007/">CFUNITED Express in Chicago</a> event before MAX. The price, until the end of the month, is 149, which is for a full day of speakers, including myself obviously. The <a href="http://express.cfunited.com/go/chicago/2007/topics">topic</a> list is posted so check it out. If you are attending MAX this year, there is no reason not to extend you stay and gain a lot of knowledge at the same time!</p>
