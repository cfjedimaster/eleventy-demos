<p>Rey informed this morning that one of my articles on ColdFusion and Ajax was mentioned over on <a href="http://www.ajaxian.com">Ajaxian</a>, an aggregation/news type site concerning, of course, Ajax. The article is:</p>
<p><a href="http://ajaxian.com/archives/adobe-coldfusion-8-gets-into-the-ajax-game">Adobe ColdFusion 8 gets into the Ajax game</a></p>
<p>If you know of other good Ajax/ColdFusion articles, drop Rey Bango a line (reybango {at} gmail [dot] com ). I'll also recommend <a href="http://www.ajaxrain.com">AjaxRain</a>. I found some very sweet demos there yesterday I plan on blogging about a bit later today. They take submissions as well.</p>
