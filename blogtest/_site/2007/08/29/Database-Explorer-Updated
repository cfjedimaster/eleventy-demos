<p>My Database Explorer (first discussed <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2007/8/14/Database-Explorer--ColdFusion-8-Sample-Application">here</a>) has been updated with a few minor tweaks. First off I added a simple alpha sort to the DSNs. Secondly the IE7 issue with the SQL editor is fixed, thanks to TJ Downes.
