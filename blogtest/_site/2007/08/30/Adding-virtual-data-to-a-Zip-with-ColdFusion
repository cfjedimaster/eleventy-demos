<p>I wrapped up the CFZIP portion of my work on CFWACK last night and I came across a cool feature. Did you know that you can add fake/virtual/you get the idea files to a zip? If you use CFZIP to create a zip you can specify a file or folder. This data has to exist on the file system. However - if you make use of the child cfzipparam tag, you can add a file directly from a variable. Consider the following simple example:</p>
<code>
&lt;cfset zipFile = expandPath("./zp.zip")&gt;
<p>&lt;cfzip file=&quot;#zipFile#&quot; action=&quot;zip&quot;&gt;
&lt;cfzipparam content=&quot;#repeatString('Simple Text',999)#&quot; entrypath=&quot;simple.txt&quot;&gt;
&lt;cfzipparam source=&quot;#expandPath('./unzip.cfm')#&quot; entrypath=&quot;/sub/unzipfile.cfm&quot;&gt;	
&lt;/cfzip&gt;
</code></p>
<p>This code sample adds two entries to a zip file. The first is a string. I used repeatString with a count of 999 so I could test how well it compressed. The second zipparam tag uses a real file name - but note how I change both the name and folder for the file.</p>
<p>The only thing missing is the ability to store zip data itself into a variable. When making a zip, the file attribute is required. It would be nice if we could specify &quot;name&quot; and have the binary data stored there. Then we could serve up 100% completely virtual zips to users. (Obviously that could be a bit intensive so you would need to use it with care.)</p>
