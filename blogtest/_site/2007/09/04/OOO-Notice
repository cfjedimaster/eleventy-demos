<h1>Post</h1>

<p>I should have blogged this a bit earlier, but things will be quiet around here as I'm out of the office today and tomorrow. I had to fly to San Francisco for a quick meeting. I used to live here back in 97 or so and haven't been back in what seems like forever. Of course - yesterday I pick up a head cold, but I'd rather travel with that then the flu.</p>
<p>Anyway - just a note to let folks know I'll be a bit slow(er) to respond to emails and blogging will be light.</p>
