<h1>Post</h1>

<p>Just a quick note to let folks know how Galleon 2 development is going. Today I wrapped up the security modifications. There were a few things I had forgot - like search and RSS. I also added a page in the admin that lets you edit the settings in the INI file. To do:</p>
<ol>
<li> Pick a <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2007/8/24/Calling-wanttobe-artists--Galleon-Logo">logo</a>.
<li> Write code to handle message/thread/forum deletes and updating stats (posts in conferences, last post, etc).
</ol>
<p>Right now my plan is to wrap it this week and have a version out for folks to test. I want to formally wrap it before MAX.</p>
