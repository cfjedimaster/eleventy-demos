<p>This weekend a reader asked me an interesting question about ColdFusion mappings. Imagine the following two mappings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mapping /org points to /Webserver/Webroot
<li>Mapping /org/foo points to /projects/foo.com
</ul>
<p>He was curious to know if this would work right. The second mapping looks to be under org, but really points to a completely different path. I didn't know the answer to this. Every single mapping I've used in the past has always had a simple name, like /org or /foo.</p>
<p>I whipped up a quick test with two mappings named like the examples above. I put the same named CFC in each, but with different methods. I then wrote a quick script:</p>
<code>
&lt;cfset test = createObject("component","a.test")&gt;
<p>&lt;cfdump var=&quot;#test#&quot;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;cfset test = createObject(&quot;component&quot;,&quot;a.b.test&quot;)&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;cfdump var=&quot;#test#&quot;&gt;
</code></p>
<p>The results showed that there was no problem having mappings with similar names in completely different folders. ColdFusion treats the mapping name as just a simple string. The fact that one was a and one was a/b didn't imply anything special to the server.</p>
<p>The problem - though - would be that if someone put a physical folder named &quot;b&quot; under the folder that my &quot;a&quot; mapping pointed to - there would be a conflict. Which would win? The mapping. I would definitely recommend having mapping names that did not match up like the examples aboe.</p>
