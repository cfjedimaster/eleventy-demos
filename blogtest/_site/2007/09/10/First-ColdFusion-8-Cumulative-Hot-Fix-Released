<p>I just read on <a href="http://www.sargeway.com/blog/index.cfm/2007/9/10/ColdFusion-CF8-CHF1-and-CFMX702-CHF3-released">Sarge's blog</a> that the first cumulative hot fix for ColdFusion 8 has been released:</p>
<p><a href="http://kb.adobe.com/selfservice/viewContent.do?externalId=kb402466&sliceId=1">ColdFusion 8.0 Cumulative Hot Fix 1</a></p>
<p>A new cumulative hot fix was released for CF7 as well.</p>
<p><a href="http://kb.adobe.com/selfservice/viewContent.do?externalId=kb402465&sliceId=1">ColdFusion MX 7.02 Cumulative Hot Fix 3</a></p>
<p>I'm a bit upset that the <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2007/9/10/Bug-with-JavaScript-bind-and-textareas">bug</a> I reported two hours ago wasn't fixed yet - but I'll deal.</p>
