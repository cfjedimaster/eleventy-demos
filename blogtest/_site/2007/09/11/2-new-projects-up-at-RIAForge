<p>I finally got around to uploading two projects to RIAForge.</p>
<p><a href="http://pdfutils.riaforge.org/">PDFUtils</a> is my CFC meant to expand upon ColdFusion 8's PDF features.</p>
<p><a href="http://cfdbexplorer.riaforge.org/">Database Explorer</a> is my ColdFusion 8 application that makes use of cflayout, cfdbinfo, and other tags in order to let you write SQL against datasources.</p>
