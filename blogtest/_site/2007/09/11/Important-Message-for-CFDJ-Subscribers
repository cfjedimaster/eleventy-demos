<p>Sys-Con is &quot;offering&quot; a digital subscription to their Flex or Silverlight magazine to all existing CFDJ subscribers.</p>
<p><b>Please do not accept this.</b></p>
<p>I'm not sure if what they are doing is legal or not - but I'm asking/pleading that those of you who shelled out cold hard cash for this magazine to <b>not</b> accept this sham of an offer. You paid for a magazine and you deserve your money back. (Money that could be used to buy a subscription to <a href="http://www.fusionauthority.com/quarterly">FAQU</a>.)</p>
<p>I think it would be truly sad for folks to let Sys-Con get away with this. It may be well and good that CFDJ is canceled and we can move on to newer and better things (again, see <a href="http://www.fusionauthority.com/quarterly">FAQU</a>), but we can't simply let them get away with what amounts to <b>theft</b> of your money!</p>
<p>Please pass this on to anyone you know who subscribes. (If you agree of course.)</p>
