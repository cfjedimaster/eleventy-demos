<p>Over on his blog, Rob <a href="http://www.brooks-bilson.com/blogs/rob/">has posted</a> a notice about the CFCDev mailing list. I won't repeat the whole post here, but the summary is that the listserv is being moved to Google Groups. The mailing is specifically for CFC/OO type issues in ColdFusion. As Rob notes - it has had it's ups and downs (like the day when the mail server created 5K blank messages on my server's hard drive), so hopefully this move to Google will mean less IT work. (I'd rather sex angry skunks then do IT work.) To sign up, just visit the group url:</p>
