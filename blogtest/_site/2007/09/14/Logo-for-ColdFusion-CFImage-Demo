<p>A long time ago - in a place far, far away (sorry, couldn't resist), I remember seeing a cool little program on the Apple 2c that taught kids programming by having them move a little turtle around a screen. This was based on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_%28programming_language%29">Logo</a> programming language. Someone mentioned it on a thread yesterday in CF-TALK, and me being the crazy person I am I decided - what the heck - let me try to recreate this in ColdFusion.</p>
<p>So with that - I present CF_LOGO. This is a custom tag that lets you create a canvas and then issue commands for the turtle (or pen) to draw. For example:</p>
<code>
&lt;cf_logo&gt;
forward 100
right 90
forward 60
right 90
forward 90
right 90
forward 50
left 90
forward 99
home
forward 100
&lt;/cf_logo&gt;
</code>
<p>This tells the turtle/pen to move, turn, move, etc. The home command simply returns the turtle to the center of the canvas. This creates the following image:</p>

<p>The language supports many operations, but my tag supports the following commands:</p>
<p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="5">
<tr>
	<td>forward/fd X</td>
	<td>Move the pen forward X pixels.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>right x</td>
	<td>Turn to the right X degrees. Currently X is ignored and all turns are 90 degrees.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>left x</td>
	<td>Turn to the left X degrees. Currently X is ignored and all turns are 90 degrees.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>clearscreen/cs</td>
	<td>Clears the screen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>home</td>
	<td>Moves the pen to the center of the canvas.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>penup/pu</td>
	<td>Lifts the pen. Any future drawing operations won't be displayed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>pendown/pd</td>
	<td>Lowers the pen. Any future drawing operations will be displayed.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>The custom tag allows you to specify a height and width, a background and pen color, and you can even tell it to return the image as a CFImage object:</p>
<code>
&lt;cf_logo variable="test"&gt;
forward 100
right 90
forward 60
right 90
forward 90
&lt;/cf_logo&gt;
<p>&lt;cfset imageScaleToFit(test,100,100)&gt;
&lt;cfimage action=&quot;writetobrowser&quot; source=&quot;#test#&quot;&gt;
</code></p>
<p>Finally, I've set up a demo that lets you issue commands one at a time, to basically draw a picture online:</p>

<p>And yes - this is a <b>complete and utter waste of time</b>. That's what made it fun.<p><a href='enclosures/D%3A%5Chosts%5Cwww%2Ecoldfusionjedi%2Ecom%5Cenclosures%2Flogo%2Ezip'>Download attached file.</a></p></p>
