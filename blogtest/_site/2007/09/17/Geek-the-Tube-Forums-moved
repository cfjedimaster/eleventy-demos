<p>Just in time for the Fall season, I've finally got around to moving my Geek the Tube forums to a new site. You can find the forums, and the blog, at <a href="http://www.geekthetube.com">http://www.geekthetube.com</a>. I set up a blog on front for more generic announcement type news, and I'll probably stop blogging most TV stuff here (except for the Lost reviews of course!). Both Scott Stroz and Scott Pinkston will be blogging there (Scott S has promised to prove to me that <i>Rescue Me</i> is worth watching) as well.</p>
