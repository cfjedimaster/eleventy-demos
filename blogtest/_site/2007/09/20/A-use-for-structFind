<p>While in general I would not think any ColdFusion function is useless, I've never really thought much of <a href="http://www.cfquickdocs.com/?getDoc=StructFind">structFind()</a>. StructFind simply returned value of a structure's key. To me - this seemed silly. If you wanted the value of the key - why wouldn't you just get it?</p>
<code>
&lt;cfset s = structNew()&gt;
&lt;cfset s.name = "Paris Hilton"&gt;
&lt;cfset s.gender = "female"&gt;
&lt;cfset s.iq = 9 * randRange(1,10) * -1&gt;
<p>&lt;!--- silly! ---&gt;
&lt;cfoutput&gt;#structFind(s, &quot;name&quot;)#&lt;/cfoutput&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;!--- not so silly! ---&gt;
&lt;cfoutput&gt;#s.iq#&lt;/cfoutput&gt;
</code></p>
<p>Now one could make the point that it would be useful in cases where you don't know the key until runtime, but then you would just use bracket notation:</p>
<code>
&lt;!--- still not silly! ---&gt;
&lt;cfset key = "gender"&gt;
&lt;cfoutput&gt;#s[key]#&lt;/cfoutput&gt;
</code>
<p>But yesterday on the cfaussie listserv, Mark Mandel shared an interesting, and useful, well, use for the function. I quote him here:</p>
<blockquote>
I use StructFind() a lot - simply because I tend to encapsulate
struct's behind getter's and setters quite regualrly.
<p>So Inside a CFC you would find me writing:</p>
<p>&lt;cfset thisValue = StructFind(getStruct(), key)&gt;</p>
<p>As ColdFusion doesn't support syntax like:</p>
<p>&lt;cfset thisValue = getStruct()[key]&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interesting! Has anyone else use the function like this? (Or in some other way?)</p>
