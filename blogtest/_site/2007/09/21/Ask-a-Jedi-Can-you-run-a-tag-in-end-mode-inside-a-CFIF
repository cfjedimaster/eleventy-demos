<p>Kyle Hayes pinged me with an interesting question today. He wanted to run a custom tag in &quot;end&quot; mode - but inside a CFIF block:</p>
<code>
&lt;cfif parishilton.iq gt 50&gt;
&lt;/cf_sometag&gt;
&lt;/cfif&gt;
</code>
<p>This of course won't work - it will throw an error. Luckily there is a way around it, and I discuss it here in this blog entry from 2004:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm?mode=entry&entry=CBC51433-9A3C-C746-EF925673B227943D">Manually Setting Execution Mode</a></p>
<p>p.s. This entry is basically a pointer to a <b>way</b> old blog post of mine. I figured since the question came up it was ok to repeat it. Good idea? Bad idea? Waste of space?</p>
