<p>A quick tip - how do you change the text of a window created by CFWINDOW? All you need to do is grab the underlying window object:</p>
<code>
var win = ColdFusion.Window.getWindowObject("mywin");
</code>
<p>In this object there is a body property which is a complex structure pointing to the body of the window. I thought perhaps the body was a simple string. I did:</p>
<code>
win.body = 'Chicago better not be too cold';
</code>
<p>Which didn't work (nor did it throw an error). Then I used ColdFusion's Ajax debugger:</p>
<code>
ColdFusion.Log.dump(win.body);
</code>
<p>This revealed the entire body element and I saw that there was a dom key which pointed to the DOM object. So all together now - the code is:</p>
<code>
var win = ColdFusion.Window.getWindowObject("mywin");
win.body.dom.innerHTML = "Hi Ray, how are you?";
</code>
<p>And there is a complete template for you to try:</p>
<code>
&lt;script&gt;
function test() {
	var win = ColdFusion.Window.getWindowObject("mywin");
	win.body.dom.innerHTML = "Hi Ray, how are you?";
}
&lt;/script&gt;
<p>&lt;cfwindow name=&quot;mywin&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; closable=&quot;true&quot; initShow=&quot;true&quot; title=&quot;Test&quot;&gt;
Initial Content
&lt;/cfwindow&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;form&gt;
&lt;input type=&quot;button&quot; onClick=&quot;test()&quot; value=&quot;test&quot;&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></p>
<p><b>Edit:</b> Please be sure to read Todd's comment below. There is a simpler way to do what I did above. I'd nuke my own entry - but I figure the alternative I used would still be of interest to folks.</p>
