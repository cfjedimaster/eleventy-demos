<p>I'm sitting in Lafayette Regional waiting to board my flight to Memphis on the way to Chicago. If you are a reader of the blog and are attending MAX, be sure to say hi to the tall goofy looking guy (wait, this is a tech conference, that may not be specific enough).</p>
<p>I assume everyone remembers the &quot;rules&quot; - while I am gone you are not to find any bugs in my software. Everything works perfectly. These are not the droids you are looking for. Etc.</p>
<p>I'll be blogging as much as possible from MAX, but if you have any specific questions, let me know!</p>
