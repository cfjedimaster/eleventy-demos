<p>Nathan Mische has <a href="http://www.mischefamily.com/nathan/index.cfm/2007/10/1/How-ColdFire-Works">posted</a> an awesome article on ColdFire and how it works, along with what to check if it isn't working. Last night at the &quot;Meet the CF Team&quot; Birds of a Feather, someone made the comment that default debug template isn't XHTML compliant. Well, one nice thing about <a href="http://coldfire.riaforge.org">ColdFire</a> is that it doesn't output <i>anything</i> onto the visible portions of your page at all.</p>
<p>As a reminder - the debug templates are all unencrypted CFML. That's how ColdFire was able to take off - I just looked at what was used in the default debugging template and rewrote it for use in Firebug. So if you don't like something about the debug templates - just edit them!</p>
