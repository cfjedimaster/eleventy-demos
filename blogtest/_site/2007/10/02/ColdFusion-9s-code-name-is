<p>I'm a bit late blogging this - but the code name for ColdFusion 9 is Jedi.</p>
<p>Ok, no, just kidding, although that would have been a good name. The code name is Centuar. As we all know, getting the code name picked is 90% of the development. Good job, Adobe. Now when will it be released???</p>
