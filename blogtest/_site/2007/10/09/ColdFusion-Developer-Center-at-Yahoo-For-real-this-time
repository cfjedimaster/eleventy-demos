<p>Many, many moons ago I <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2007/6/7/It-is-here--Yahoo-launches-ColdFusion-Developer-Center">blogged</a> about the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/coldfusion/">ColdFusion Developer Center</a> at Yahoo. For some reason, it was never added to the navigation. It was finally added last week during MAX. Thanks Yahoo! (And thank you again for making your APIs ten times easier than Google.)</p>
