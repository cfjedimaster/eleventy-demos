<h1>Post</h1>

<p>I was doing a code review this morning when I found this little gem:</p>
<code>
&lt;CFSEARCH NAME="pariscontactsTotal"                    COLLECTION="#collection#"
TYPE="#searchType#"
CRITERIA="#search#"&gt;
<p>&lt;CFSEARCH NAME=&quot;pariscontacts&quot;
COLLECTION=&quot;#collection#&quot;
TYPE=&quot;#searchType#&quot;
CRITERIA=&quot;#search#&quot;
STARTROW=&quot;#startrow#&quot;
MAXROWS=&quot;#itemsPerPage#&quot;&gt;
</code></p>
<p>So why the duplicate searches? They wanted to return a page of data, but also tell the user how many total matches were returned. This is far easier in ColdFusion 7 and higher. If you add the &quot;status&quot; attribute to your CFSEARCH tag, you can a structure back that contains keys for: Found (how many total found, even if you paginate the results), Searched (total number of records in the collection), and Time (time it took to search).</p>
<p>They could get rid of that first cfsearch and just do this:</p>
<code>
&lt;CFSEARCH NAME="pariscontacts"
COLLECTION="#collection#"
TYPE="#searchType#"
CRITERIA="#search#"
STARTROW="#startrow#"
MAXROWS="#itemsPerPage#"
status="result"&gt;
</code>
<p>I'd name the client - but I'd like to get paid. ;) I will point something they did that was <b>very</b> good (and something I forget to do from time to time). Before searching, they run the search through <a href="http://www.cflib.org/udf.cfm/verityclean">verityClean</a> first. A friend of mine had a site that didn't do this - but as he owes me beer, I won't name him either. ;)</p>
