<h1>Post</h1>

<p>Scott Stroz has launched a new blog aggregator that focuses just on Flex blogs:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.allyourflexarebelongtous.com/index.cfm">All Your Flex Are Belong To Us</a></p>
<p>The name is a bit long - but there is no way you can forget it. I see there are already over four and a half thousand entries posted. The site uses the code base from <a href="http://www.coldfusionbloggers.org">ColdFusionBloggers.org</a>, which I will remind people is free for anyone to use. (And will be updated later this week.)</p>
