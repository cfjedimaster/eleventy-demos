<p>When matches are found, I use pagination, but the actual data is just dumped out. I could have done this all sexy and Ajaxy, but I figured a one file solution that also worked in ColdFusion 7 would be nice as well.</p>

<p>You can download the code below. I have another extension coming out later this week. This will join my <a href="http://spoolmail.riaforge.org">SpoolMail</a> project and Scott's <a href="http://flogr.riaforge.org">Flogr</a> as must-have add ons to your ColdFusion Admin. (Well, I think they are must-haves, but I'm biased. :)</p>
<p>p.s. Anyone know how I can map a Windows drive to my Mac?<p><a href='enclosures/D%3A%5Chosts%5Cwww%2Ecoldfusionjedi%2Ecom%5Cenclosures%2Findex%2Ecfm%2Ezip'>Download attached file.</a></p></p>
