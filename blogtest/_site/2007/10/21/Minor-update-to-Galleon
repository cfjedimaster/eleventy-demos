<p>Yesterday I released a minor, but important update to <a href="http://galleon.riaforge.org">Galleon</a>. This update fixes IE support in the Admin, which was pretty badly broken. I had forgot about the IE &quot;feature&quot; where an image button will return form.name.x, not form.name. (Thanks IE!) A few other formatting issues were fixed as well. Thanks again to <a href="http://www.fullcitymedia.com/">Full City Media</a> for quickly responding and fixing the bugs. Please note that I haven't yet had a chance to fix the MS Access bug. I hope to get to that this week.</p>
<p>Oh and if the Saints lose this one I'm officially pretending I'm from Texas.</p>
