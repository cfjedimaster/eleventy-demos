<h1>Post</h1>

<p>Adobe and O'Reilly have posted a <a href="http://weblogs.macromedia.com/flexteam/archives/2007/10/call_for_topics.cfm">call for topics</a> for the upcoming Flex 3 Cookbook. This is the print version of the book and is a great chance to get your content published. I'm ashamed to admit I've not had a chance at all to play with Flex 3, so I know I'm really missing out.</p>
