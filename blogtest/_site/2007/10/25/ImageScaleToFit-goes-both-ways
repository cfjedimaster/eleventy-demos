<p>Ok, so this is probably me having a &quot;Duh&quot; moment here, but I forgot that imageScaleToFit goes both ways. What do I mean by that? If you are using the code to create a thumbnail, like so:</p>
<code>
&lt;cfset imageScaleToFit(myImage,255,255,"highestQuality")&gt;
</code>
<p>and the image is <i>less than</i> 255 tall or wide than ColdFusion will increase the size of the image. As I said - duh. Luckily this is simple enough to solve:</p>
<code>
&lt;cfif myImage.width gt 255 or myImage.height gt 255&gt;
	&lt;cfset imageScaleToFit(myImage,255,255,"highestQuality")&gt;
&lt;/cfif&gt;
</code>
<p>You could also make a simple UDF out of this as well but not sure if it is worth the trouble.</p>
