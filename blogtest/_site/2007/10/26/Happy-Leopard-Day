<p>Just curious - but who else is getting the new version of OS X today? I preordered mine and it will be arriving via Fedex in the next two hours! I still feel like I'm a newbie to the Mac platform, but I'm definitely falling into the fan boy camp and I absolutely cannot wait to give Leopard a spin.</p>
