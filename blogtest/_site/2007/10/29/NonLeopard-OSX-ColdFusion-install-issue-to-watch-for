<p>I didn't discover this - but it was reported to me by a friend and former coworker, <a href="http://www.venturegeek.com/">Nathan Dintenfass</a>. I'm copying his findings here verbatim:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I was trying to install CF8 on a new MacBook Pro, and I kept getting an error that said "installer user interface mode not supported".  I tried updating my java VM, but no dice.  Turns out the issue is that the installer app was in a folder containing a "!", and that special character in the path prevented it from loading. Once I moved the installer to a path without a special character it worked.

<p>Interesting! I can't imagine ever naming a folder like that though. Anyone else run into this?</p>
