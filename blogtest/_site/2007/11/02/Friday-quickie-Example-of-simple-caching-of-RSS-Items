<p>I'm doing a code review for a client (which I've been doing a lot lately and boy is it fun to find bugs in someone <i>else's</i> code for once ;) and noticed his home page was using CFFEED to put CNN's latest articles. However, he wasn't doing any caching at all. I whipped up a quick mod for him to show a simple example of caching. It doesn't have any fancy way to force a refresh, but quickly sped up his home page. So here is a quick code snippet showing simple caching of CFFEED:</p>
<code>
&lt;cfset feedurl = "http://www.mugglenet.com/feeds/news.xml"&gt;
&lt;cfset cacheMinutes = 60&gt;
<p>&lt;!--- check if cached, and not too old ---&gt;
&lt;cfif not structKeyExists(application,&quot;rsscache&quot;) or dateDiff(&quot;n&quot;, application.rsscache.created, now()) gt cacheMinutes&gt;
&lt;cffeed source=&quot;#feedurl#&quot; query=&quot;entries&quot;&gt;
&lt;cfset application.rsscache = structNew()&gt;
&lt;cfset application.rsscache.data = entries&gt;
&lt;cfset application.rsscache.created = now()&gt;
&lt;/cfif&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;cfdump var=&quot;#application.rsscache#&quot;&gt;
</code></p>
<p>All I do is check for an application variable. If it doesn't exist, or the 'created' value for the cache is more than cacheMinutes old, I reload from cffeed. While not as fancy as a <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2007/10/15/Doing-HTTP-Conditional-Gets-in-ColdFusion">conditional get</a>, it is certainly a lot simpler.</p>
