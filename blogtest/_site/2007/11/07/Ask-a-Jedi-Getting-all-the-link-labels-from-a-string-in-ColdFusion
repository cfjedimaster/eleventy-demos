<p>A reader asked me how they could use regex to find all the link labels in a string. Not the links - but the label for the link. It is relatively easy to grab all the matches for a regex in ColdFusion 8, consider the following code block:</p>
<code>
&lt;cfsavecontent variable="s"&gt;
This is some text. It is true that &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com"&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/a&gt; is a good
magician, but the real &lt;a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com"&gt;question&lt;/a&gt; is how he would stand up
against Godzilla. That is what I want to &lt;a href="http://www.adobe.com"&gt;see&lt;/a&gt; - a Harry Potter vs Godzilla
grudge match. Harry has his wand, Godzilla has his &lt;a href="http://www.cfsilence.com"&gt;breath&lt;/a&gt;, it would
be &lt;i&gt;so&lt;/i&gt; cool.
&lt;/cfsavecontent&gt;
<p>&lt;cfset matches = reMatch(&quot;&lt;[aA].<em>?&gt;.</em>?&lt;/[aA]&gt;&quot;,s)&gt;
&lt;cfdump var=&quot;#matches#&quot;&gt;
</code></p>
<p>I create a string with a few links in it. I then use the new reMatch function to grab all the matches. My regex says - find all HTML links. It isn't exactly perfect, it won't match a closing A tag that has an extra space in it, but you get the picture. This results in a match of all the links:</p>

<p>But you will notice that the HTML links are still there. How can we get rid of them? I simply looped over the array and did a second pass:</p>
<code>
&lt;cfset links = arrayNew(1)&gt;
&lt;cfloop index="a" array="#matches#"&gt;
	&lt;cfset arrayAppend(links, rereplace(a, "&lt;.*?&gt;","","all"))&gt;
&lt;/cfloop&gt;
<p>&lt;cfdump var=&quot;#links#&quot;&gt;
</code></p>
<p>This gives you the following output:</p>
