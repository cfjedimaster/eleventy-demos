<p>First off - for <b>both</b> presentations, I had crashing issues. Not sure if it was Leopard or Connect, but Connect kept crashing on me. So about 2-3 times each in both presentations, I drop off for a minute. Personally, I think Connect couldn't contain the awesomeness that is Raymond, but that's just my opinion.</p>
