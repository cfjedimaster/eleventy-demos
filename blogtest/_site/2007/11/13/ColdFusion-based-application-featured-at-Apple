<p>BA Hellman wrote me last night to mention his web site, <a href="http://answers.nobosh.com/">noboshanswers</a>, is being featured at Apple: <a href="http://www.apple.com/webapps/">Apple - Web apps - All Categories</a>. Specifically they are featuring his <a href="http://www.apple.com/webapps/productivity/noboshanswers.html">iPhone version</a> of the site. BA - find a way to make them mention &quot;ColdFusion&quot; in the review! (Oh, and if anyone would like me to review their iPhone enabled site, please send me an iPhone. I'd be happy to. Seriously.)</p>
