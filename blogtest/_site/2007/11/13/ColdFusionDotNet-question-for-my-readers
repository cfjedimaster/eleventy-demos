Hi Raymond - thanks in advance for taking the time to respond to this. I'm playing around with the .NET integration stuff in Scorpio, and I'm wondering if there's a way to hot deploy new versions of assemblies without restarting the .NET integration service.  Currently, I'm having the assemblies accessed locally, but there's some flexibility around the setup.  I've
seen several blog posts (including one on yours) that list hot deployment as one of the benefits of the new .NET integration functionality, so I'm hoping there's an easy answer to this problem.
