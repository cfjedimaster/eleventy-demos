<p>I've gotten quite a few emails from folks letting me know that <a href="http://www.riaforge.org">RIAForge</a> is sending 3 email reports a day instead of 1. I just wanted to let folks know that I do know about this.</p>
<p>In case folks are curious - I don't actually know why this is happening now, but I've enabled logging for scheduled tasks to see if I can find what is up. Of course I'll have to wait a good 20 hours until it runs again, but hopefully the log will shed some light into what is going wrong.</p>
