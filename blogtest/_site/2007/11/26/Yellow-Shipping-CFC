<p>Use <a href="http://www.myyellow.com/dynamic/services/content/index.jsp">Yellow</a> for shipping? I'm working with a client who wants to use Yellow for shipping. They were interested in cutting costs a bit - so I wrote the Yellow integration for free in exchange for being able to open source it. Personally I've never even heard of Yellow before this project, so I don't think many people will use this, but I've attached the CFC I created to this blog entry. No docs or anything fancy like that. The CFC basically just pings their service and parses the response into a simple structure.</p>
<p>There was one interesting tidbit to this code. When I hit their service I get a nice XML packet back. In some cases the zip you send may not be enough. Their service will respond by asking you to pick a particular city to narrow down the request. What is odd is that their response - in XML - is a set of HTML. For example:</p>
<code>
&lt;INPUT%20TYPE=HIDDEN%20NAME="shprZipForCities"%20VALUE="05495"%20&gt;Origin%20City&lt;select%20name="shprCities"%20size="1"&gt;&lt;option%20value="ST%20GEORGE"&gt;ST%20GEORGE&lt;/option&gt;&lt;option%20value="WILLISTON"&gt;WILLISTON&lt;/option&gt;&lt;/select&gt;
</code>
<p>I look for this response and parse out the cities so the error message can be checked. Probably not the most elegant solution, but it works.<p><a href='enclosures/D%3A%5Chosts%5Cwww%2Ecoldfusionjedi%2Ecom%5Cenclosures%2Fmyyellow%2Ecfc%2Ezip'>Download attached file.</a></p></p>
