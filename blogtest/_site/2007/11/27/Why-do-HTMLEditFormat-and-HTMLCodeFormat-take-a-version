<p>Sorry for all the 'why' questions today - but this is the second time today I've run into something weird in ColdFusion. Did you know that both HTMLEditFormat and HTMLCodeFormat take a second argument? The argument, version, is supposed to allow you to specify what version of HTML to target. But for both tags - the argument is ignored. Even though the argument is ignored, the docs list out 3 possible values:</p>
<ul>
<li>-1: The latest implementation of HTML
<li>2.0: HTML 2.0 (default)
<li>3.2: HTML 3.2
</ul>
<p>I'm wondering if this is something that was planned a while ago and just forgotten - like the <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2007/11/27/Why-must-cfexecute-be-closed">cfexecute oddity</a> I found earlier.</p>
