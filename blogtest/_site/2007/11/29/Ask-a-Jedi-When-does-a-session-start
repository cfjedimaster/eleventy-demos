<p>Darren asks:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I want to use on sessionstart to initiate a session variable and then use that value in a function call to to set the default language for a site but I get an error saying the session var isn't there. Does the session start after the first request? Should I use on application start instead?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No and no. onSessionStart will definitely fire before onRequestStart. Turns out - Darren had another problem. He had written his Application.cfc <i>without</i> the session variables in his onSessionStart, he had hit his site, and then he had modified the onSessionStart. Since his session had already started, the method didn't run again.</p>
<p>There are a few ways to get around this. One simple way is to quickly rename your Application. If you had:</p>
<code>
&lt;cfset this.name="findparishiltonsdignitysite"&gt;
</code>
<p>You can quickly rename it like so:</p>
<code>
&lt;cfset this.name="findparishiltonsdignitysite2"&gt;
</code>
<p>This is kind of hacky, but it will truly force ColdFusion to restart the application next time you hit it.</p>
<p>Another option, and what I typically use, is a URL hack:</p>
<code>
&lt;cfif structKeyExists(url,"reset")&gt;
 &lt;cfset onSessionStart()&gt;
&lt;/cfif&gt;
</code>
<p>This will <b>not</b> be single threaded, but during development, you typically don't care about it. I use this same hook to rerun onApplicationStart as well. In fact, during development I'll typically <i>always</i> run the code by appending OR 1 to the end.</p>
<p>Of course, the Nuclear Option is to restart ColdFusion, but even with ColdFusion 8 being super fast, that's overkill.</p>
