<p>I'm now in the export/import business. Well, kinda. If you use BlogCFC and need a tool to export/import your blog entries, download the attachment below. This was tested with the latest 5.9 build of blogcfc. It outputs to WDDX files in a specified folder. You can then use the import comment to read in those WDDX files to a new BlogCFC instance. This <i>may</i> become an official BlogCFC tool for V6, but for now it is an unsupported utility.</p>
<p>A big thank you to <a href="http://www.digitalprimates.com/">digital primates</a>. They needed the tool and paid me to development, then said they were cool with me giving it to the world.<p><a href='enclosures/D%3A%5Chosts%5Cwww%2Ecoldfusionjedi%2Ecom%5Cenclosures%2FArchive13%2Ezip'>Download attached file.</a></p></p>
