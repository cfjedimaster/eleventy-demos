<p>After many years of eligibility, it finally hit me. On Saturday I got a notice that I was up for jury duty. Not a 'come here on day so and so type thing' but a survey asking me questions to determine if I could do jury duty. The interesting thing about this notice is that it seems to be a federal, not local, court. Anyone done jury duty in that capacity before? How is it different? I'm looking forward to this - unless it impacts my work much. In theory I can just work at night, but if it lasts more than a week it may get difficult.</p>
