<p>Just a quick note to point out a small display bug with CF8's HTML grid. If - and only if - you use an inline query to populate the grid instead of pointing to a URL, your data may not display correctly. Specifically, I had data with a \ in it (a file path), and on display the \ was removed. I hacked around the issue by just changing my paths to use /, which still leaves the data quite readable. Again - this error only occurs if you pass the data directly to the grid instead of using a binding.</p>
