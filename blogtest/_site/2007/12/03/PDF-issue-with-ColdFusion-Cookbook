<p>I had hoped to have it solved by now, but as it is taking a bit longer than expected, I thought I'd let folks know that the PDF download will be returning to the <a href="http://www.coldfusioncookbook.com">ColdFusion Cookbook</a> soon. I'm working with Adobe to figure out a particular CFDOCUMENT bug with the site under ColdFusion 8. When the bug is fixed, I'll blog about what I changed and how the bug was fixed.</p>
