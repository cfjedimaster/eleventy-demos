<p>I've got an XBox Live Arcade game that was purchased a while ago. After transferring it to the new XBox Elite hard drive, it shows up as a trial game. When I go to purchase it, it says I already own it (true), it offers to redownload, but even after it does, the game sticks in trial mode. Anyone seen this before?</p>
