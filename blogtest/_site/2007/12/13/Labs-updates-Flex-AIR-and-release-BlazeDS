<p>Adobe <a href="http://labs.adobe.com">Labs</a> released a few nice updates this morning (or last night). First up is the 3rd beta of <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/air/">Adobe AIR</a>. (And yes, they still have the <b>annoying</b> auto-play video with sound.) Next is the 3rd beta of <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/flex/">Flex 3</a>. Last is <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/blazeds/">BlazeDS</a>, which if I read it right is an open source version of Flash Data Services. I won't repeat why I think AIR and Flex are cool (just last night I was urging someone to stop using Flash Forms on their site and switch over to Flex), but take the time to download and play with these technologies if you haven't yet.</p>
