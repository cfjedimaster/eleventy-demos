Last year I did a few Christmas style friday challenges, so I'm a bit overdue. This one is rather simple. Given a query that contains an ID, which corresponds to a day, and a gift, print out the famous "12 Days of Christmas" song dynamically. Ie, day 1 you get gift 1. Day 2 you get 1 of gift 1, and 2 of gift 2. And so on.
<p>Bonus points if you use festive green and red fonts in your display. (Once again, this is why they don't let me design.)</p>
<p>Double bonus points if you make a cfpresentation out it and record MP3s to go along with it.</p>
<p>Here is your query that you must use with the code. (Note, it uses CF8 Array shorthand style. If you aren't on CF8, you can rewrite that as a list and use listToArray.)</p>
<code>
&lt;cfset song = querynew("id,gift","integer,varchar")&gt;
<p>&lt;cfset gifts = [&quot;A partridge in a pear tree&quot;,&quot;Two turtle doves&quot;,&quot;Three French hens&quot;,&quot;Four calling birds&quot;,&quot;Five golden rings&quot;,&quot;Six geese a-laying&quot;,
&quot;Seven swans a-swimming&quot;,&quot;Eight maids a-milking&quot;,&quot;Nine ladies dancing&quot;,&quot;Ten lords a-leaping&quot;,&quot;Eleven pipers piping&quot;,&quot;Twelve drummers drumming&quot;]&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;cfloop index=&quot;x&quot; from=&quot;1&quot; to=&quot;#arrayLen(gifts)#&quot;&gt;
&lt;cfset queryAddRow(song)&gt;
&lt;cfset querySetCell(song, &quot;id&quot;, x)&gt;
&lt;cfset querySetCell(song, &quot;gift&quot;, gifts[x])&gt;
&lt;/cfloop&gt;
</code></p>
