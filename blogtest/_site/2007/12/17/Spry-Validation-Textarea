<p>It's been a while since I reviewed a Spry Validation example, so I thought I'd take a few minutes this morning to demonstrate another example - the Textarea validation. As with the other validation types (I've linked to my examples below), you begin by including a CSS and JavaScript library:</p>
<!--more-->
<code>
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt; 
&lt;script src="/spryjs/SpryValidationTextarea.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; 
&lt;link href="/sprycss/SpryValidationTextarea.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" /&gt; 
&lt;/head&gt;
</code>
<p>You next take your textarea, and wrap it in a span:</p>
<code>
&lt;span id="sprytextarea1"&gt;
	&lt;textarea name="textarea1" id="textarea1" cols="45" rows="5"&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
</code>
<p>As with the other validation types, the span wrap acts like a 'marker' to Spry to help it work with your form field and validation.</p>
<p>Next we &quot;enable&quot; validation:</p>
<code>
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
var sprytextarea1 = new Spry.Widget.ValidationTextarea("sprytextarea1");
&lt;/script&gt;
</code>
<p>The ID passed to ValidationTextarea is the ID used for the span that wraps the textarea. As before, we can add a simple validation message to require the textarea:</p>
<code>
&lt;span class="textareaRequiredMsg"&gt;A value is required.&lt;/span&gt;
</code>
<p>Spry automatically hides/shows this span based on the value in the textarea. You can see a super exciting demo of this here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/demos/spryform/textarea.html">http://www.coldfusionjedi.com/demos/spryform/textarea.html</a></p>
<p>Where things get interesting are all the little options you have with validation. I bet the one folks will use most is the maxChars option. As you can guess, this lets you set a maximum number of characters. You can enable this like so:</p>
<code>
var sprytextarea1 = new Spry.Widget.ValidationTextarea("sprytextarea1", {maxChars:100});
</code> 
<p>What's interesting is that there doesn't seem to be a corresponding span error class for this. I tried:</p>
<code>
&lt;span class="textareaMaxCharsMsg"&gt;You typed more than 100 characters!&lt;/span&gt;
</code>
<p>But it never showed up. Instead - Spry blocked the characters. When I tried to type more than 100, I was stopped. If I pasted a big block, it got cropped. I guess the team figured there was no need to support a message for something you couldn't do.</p>
<p>There is a minChars option as well, and the message does instead work for that:</p>
<code>
&lt;span class="textareaMinCharsMsg"&gt;You need to type 5 chars!&lt;/span&gt;
</code>
<p>Spry also supports a counter, which is nice. You can either show people how many characters they have left, or show them how many they have typed, or both! Here is a simple example of showing the number of characters. First, we add a new span:</p>
<code>
Chars Remaining: &lt;span id="my_counter_span"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
</code>
<p>Note the ID. Now when I create my validation object, I enable the character counter with two options:</p>
<p>counterType:&quot;chars_remaining&quot;</p>
<p>This tells Spry to show the number of characters left. I'd use &quot;chars_count&quot; to show the total number of characters typed.</p>
<p>counterId:&quot;my_counter_span&quot;</p>
<p>This simply tells Spry what span id to update. Simple, right?</p>
<p>Another cool little feature is &quot;hint&quot; - the hint attribute lets you put a hint inside the textarea telling the user what to type:</p>
<p>hint:&quot;Enter Wisdom&quot;</p>
<p>On initially loading the form, the user would see &quot;Enter Wisdom&quot; in the textarea. As soon as they click, the text goes away.</p>
<p>You can see a demo of all of the above here:</p>
