<p>Today I wanted to take a look at the logs for <a href="http://www.cfbloggers.org">CFBloggers</a>. I normally just use Google Analytics, but with CFBloggers being so Ajax-heavy, I was curious what the IIS logs would be like compared to Google. I downloaded the logs from the last two months and then realized I had no idea how to parse them. I used to have some decent tools for Windows, but didn't know of anything for OSX.</p>

<p>So I thought to myself, &quot;Self - ColdFusion 8 reads files super quick, why not do it in CF?&quot; I agreed with myself and decided to give it a go. It reminded me that one of the very first apps I wrote, back in 92ish, was a Perl app to parse web site log files.</p>
<p>To start off, I decided that I'd just parse one log file. I was going to make the code parse a directory of log files and use CFTHREAD, but shoot, I really just wanted to look at a day and see what it was like compared to Google. So I began with:</p>
<code>
&lt;cfset fileToRead = "/Users/ray/Desktop/cfbloggers logs/ex071219.log"&gt;
</code>
<p>And then I had some coffee and came back two hours later. Next I wrote the meat of the code. First off - ColdFusion 8 makes it super easy to read in a file line by line:</p>
<code>
&lt;cfloop index="line" file="#fileToRead#"&gt;
</code>
<p>Now how do you parse IIS? I looked at the file and noticed it began with a few lines that started with #. One of these lines was a 'header' line that defined the columns. So I began with logic that said: If start with #, ignore unless header line, and create a query otherwise.</p>
<code>
&lt;cfif left(line, 1) is "##"&gt;
	&lt;cfif findNoCase("##Fields:", line) is 1 and not isDefined("data")&gt;
</code>
<p>Data is the name of the query I'm going to create. Why bother checking it? Turns out IIS will rewrite the header info multiple times in the log file. I couldn't understand why my 5k line log file kept saying I had 200 requests. It was the multiple headers causing my query to recreate itself. In theory I'm thinking it's possible for IIS to change format mid-file, but I pretended that I didn't know that.</p>
<p>So once I find the line that begins with #Fields, I had to do some parsing:</p>
<code>
&lt;cfset cols = replace(line, "##Fields: ","")&gt;
&lt;!--- iis has cols with - in it, change to _ ---&gt;
&lt;cfset cols = replace(cols, "-", "_", "all")&gt;
&lt;!--- also may have ...() ---&gt;
&lt;cfset cols = replace(cols, "(","_","all")&gt;
&lt;cfset cols = replace(cols, ")","_","all")&gt;
&lt;cfset colArray = listToArray(cols," ")&gt;
</code>
<p>First off I remove the pretext. Next I change any - to _ since - isn't valid in a query column. Next I replace ( and ) with underscores. I create an array of my column names (even though I'll be using a list again in a bit) to make the code run a bit faster.</p>
<code>
&lt;!--- search for a col with trailing _, not critical, but nice ---&gt;
&lt;cfloop index="x" from="1" to="#arrayLen(colArray)#"&gt;
	&lt;cfif right(colArray[x],1) is "_"&gt;
		&lt;cfset colArray[x] = left(colArray[x], len(colArray[x])-1)&gt;
	&lt;/cfif&gt;
&lt;/cfloop&gt;
</code>
<p>This last bit of code simply looks for columns with an _ at the end. This represents an IIS header column named something(foo). I didn't like the dangling underscore so I cleaned it up. If I wanted to, I could also give nicer names to the IIS headers.</p>
<p>Lastly I create the query:</p>
<code>
&lt;cfset data = queryNew(arrayToList(colArray))&gt;	
</code>
<p>Ok, so thats the first branch of the CFIF inside my file loop. The second branch simply parses the line based on the columns:</p>
<code>
&lt;cfset queryAddRow(data)&gt;
<p>&lt;!--- begin parsing ---&gt;
&lt;cfloop index=&quot;x&quot; from=&quot;1&quot; to=&quot;#arrayLen(colArray)#&quot;&gt;
&lt;cfset value = listGetAt(line, x,&quot; &quot;)&gt;
&lt;cfset col = colArray[x]&gt;
&lt;cfset querySetCell(data, col,  value)&gt;
&lt;/cfloop&gt;
</code></p>
<p>And that's it. I wrote a quick query of query to give me a report of my top files:</p>
<code>
&lt;cfoutput&gt;Total number of requests: #data.recordCount#&lt;/cfoutput&gt;
<p>&lt;cfquery name=&quot;test&quot; dbtype=&quot;query&quot;&gt;
select 	count(cs_uri_stem) as total, cs_uri_stem as page
from	data
group by cs_uri_stem
order by total desc
&lt;/cfquery&gt;
&lt;cfdump var=&quot;#test#&quot; top=&quot;100&quot;&gt;
</code></p>
<p>It was here where I discovered that the silly little &quot;stats&quot; pod on CFBloggers got 4k hits yesterday (it auto-reloads). After finding that, I slowed down the reload to 240 seconds. Anyway, enjoy. If folks want to see an example using CFTHREAD, let me know.</p>
<p><b>Complete Code:</b>
<code></p>
<p>&lt;cfset fileToRead = &quot;/Users/ray/Desktop/cfbloggers logs/ex071219.log&quot;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;cfloop index=&quot;line&quot; file=&quot;#fileToRead#&quot;&gt;
&lt;!--- ignore lines with # in front ---&gt;
&lt;!--- except for fields, which will help us define the query, and SHOULD come first ---&gt;
&lt;!--- also, IIS tends to repeat, so if we have data already, ignore ---&gt;
&lt;cfif left(line, 1) is &quot;##&quot;&gt;
&lt;cfif findNoCase(&quot;##Fields:&quot;, line) is 1 and not isDefined(&quot;data&quot;)&gt;
&lt;cfset cols = replace(line, &quot;##Fields: &quot;,&quot;&quot;)&gt;

<p>p.s. It just occurred to me... I should consider writing an AIR app. :)</p>
