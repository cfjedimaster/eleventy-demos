<p>Todd just released the <a href="http://cfsilence.com/blog/client/index.cfm/2007/12/21/2007-CFeMmys--And-The-Winners-Are">winners</a> for the 2007 CFeMmy winners. Yours truly won for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Best Aggregator - <a href="http://www.cfbloggers.org">ColdFusionBloggers.org</a>: This really surprised me. I love my little aggregator, but based on the traffic it gets, I didn't think many people were actually using it!
<li>Best Blog - Your on it right now. ;) Let me guess - everyone voted for me because of my cool Lost posts, right?
<li>Best Community Site - <a href="http://www.riaforge.org">RIAForge</a>: This is not really "my" site, it belongs to Adobe, and was all Ben's idea, but as the primary developer and caretaker, I'm going to take credit for the win. ;) Big thanks go to Rob Gonda for all the cool SVN integration.
<li>Best OS Project - <a href="http://www.blogcfc.com">BlogCFC</a>: My favorite OS project, and the one with the most warts. 2008 will bring the new, shiny, fetch BlogCFC 6.
</ul>
<p>Thank you to everyone who voted for me, I really appreciate it!</p>
