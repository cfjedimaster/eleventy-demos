<p>Someone just asked in the CF IRC channel what they can do with set of encrypted templates. The developer on their team encrypted a bunch of code, deleted the originals, and left the company.</p>
<p>In the past, you could Google and download a tool to decrypt the files. Technically you were (as far as I know) breaking your license w/ Adobe. But apparently this tool doesn't work with recent servers.</p>
<p>I also heard rumors, and this was <b>way</b> back in the Allaire days, that you could call the company, explain the situation, send the files, and get the decrypted source back.</p>
<p>But what is the answer now? I don't want to promote any illegal hacks, so if someone knows the &quot;official&quot; answer, I'd like to know.</p>
<p>Of course, the best solution here is prevention. If your code was checked into a source control repository, and the developer didn't have admin rights to that machine, then your code would have been safe.</p>
