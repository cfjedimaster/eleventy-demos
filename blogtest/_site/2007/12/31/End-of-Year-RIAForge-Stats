<p>RIAForge, which <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2006/10/18/Announcing-RIAForge">launched</a> a bit over a year ago, has had a pretty good year. The stats at years end are:</p>
<p>Total Active Projects: 383<br />
Total Views: 2,778,627<br />
Total Downloads: 170,953<br />
Total Verified Users: 2,731<br /></p>
<p>I know folks are still waiting for multi-user SVN and project administration. I'm still hoping to get this &quot;real soon now&quot;, but as this is in my spare time now, it's been delayed.</p>
<p>I'm also curious to know - has anyone implemented the RIAForge source? Care to share how?</p>
