<p>Martin asks a pretty interesting question about comparing strings:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Is there a way to compare the similarities of variable strings in ColdFusion? For instance, lets say
variable.foo = "15 St Mungo Place" and variable.coo = "15 St. Mungo Place"
<p>Sql will not return a match but you and I both know that these two strings mean the same thing AND that there is only a one character difference.</p>
<p>My question is - Is there a way to get Coldfusion to recognise that there is only a one character difference (similarities) between the two strings. Obviously the potential applications for search queries etc.. could be enormous here so I'm VERY curious to see if this is possible.</p>
</p>

<p>Right off the bat, there is nothing baked into ColdFusion that will do this automatically, so we have to look at other possible solutions.</p>
<p>For some cases, you could use straight substitutions. You could have a list of common alternative spellings (&quot;st. for st&quot;) and loop over them and do replacements. That will work for simple things but probably isn't going to scale up.</p>
<p>You could also compare strings and see how close they are. I did some Googling on that, and kept coming across the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance">Levenshtein distance</a> formula. I was actually working to rebuild the pseudo-code on Wikipedia when I remembered CFLib - turns out it has a udf, <a href="http://www.cflib.org/udf.cfm?ID=1067">levDistance</a>, that can use this logic.</p>
<p>This is still somewhat of a slow process as you would need to compare your search against all the words in the database. This is probably a case where something like Verity, or the full text searching feature of your database, may be more handy.</p>
<p>Anyone done anything like this in ColdFusion?</p>
