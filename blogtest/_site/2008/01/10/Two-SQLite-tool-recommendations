<h1>Post</h1>

<p>In regards to my <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2008/1/9/Working-with-Flex-AIR-and-SQL-2">post</a> yesterday on AIR and SQLite I thought I'd share two tools that can help developers.</p>
<p>I've been using a cool AIR based SQLite tool from Christophe Coenraets. You can find it <a href="http://coenraets.org/blog/2007/10/new-air-sqlite-administration-app-with-source-code/">here</a>. It works rather nicely and I like that it has a 'history' feature since I always have trouble finding the exact location AIR stores my DB file. (I typically trace the nativepath of my File object when I forget.)</p>
<p>Then a commenter named Gareth pointed out that you can find a Firefox plugin as well. (About the only thing you can't do in a Firefox plugin is peace in the Middle East.) I installed the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/5817">SQLite Manager</a> today and it runs pretty well.</p>
<p>I'm not sure which tool I'll give preference too, and I'm sure there are others as well.</p>
<p>And lastly, if any AIR/SQLite experts out there want to help me with my date problem, let me know.</p>
