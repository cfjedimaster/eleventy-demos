<p>Today, Adobe and O'Reilly launched <a href="http://www.insideria.com/">InsideRIA</a>. What is it? I'm going to steal from Rich Tretola's <a href="http://blog.everythingflex.com/2008/01/21/introducing-insideria/">excellent introduction</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
InsideRIA.com is an online community developed by O'Reilly and sponsored by Adobe Systems Incorporated. Our goal is to create an invaluable resource for information on the ever-changing state of design and development of rich Internet applications (RIAs).

<p>If you scroll down a bit on <a href="http://blog.everythingflex.com/2008/01/21/introducing-insideria/">Rich's entry</a>, you will see that I'm a member of this new blog. This is my first &quot;blog job&quot;, so I'm pretty darn proud (and a bit scared!) to be honored by ORA. As I've said before, I'm still finding way into the RIA world. With so many years behind me as a server side developer, I feel like a new world has opened for me. I hardly consider myself an expert, but I hope that my blog posts in the past, and those I will write in the future, will help others.</p>
<p>Of course, this will not impact my blogging here (and if it does, let me know). My plan is to move my Ajax/RIA articles to InsideRIA, with a focus on learning jQuery starting next week.</p>
<p>My <a href="http://www.insideria.com/2008/01/introduction.html">first post</a> on the site is a simple introduction.</p>
