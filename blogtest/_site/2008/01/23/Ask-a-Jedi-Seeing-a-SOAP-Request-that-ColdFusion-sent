I have a question regarding calling a SOAP web service and cfscript. I need to add some header information so I'm using the addSOAPRequestHeader Function. Anyhow, my question being is there a way I can debug and somehow see the exact SOAP XML request being sent over the wire?

<p>Yes, you can do this, but it only works when you create an &quot;instance&quot; of the web service. Here is a simple example:</p>
<code>
<p>&lt;cfset wurl = &quot;http://localhost/test.cfc?WSDL&quot;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;cfset ws = createObject(&quot;webservice&quot;, wurl)&gt;
&lt;cfset time = ws.time()&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;cfset req = getSoapRequest(ws)&gt;
&lt;cfdump var=&quot;#req#&quot;&gt;
</code></p>
<p>The important bit is the getSoapRequest function. You pass it the web service object, and you get back the XML-based SOAP request that was last used. Dumping it as I did gives you a formatted XML dump, but 'req' as is will give you the pure XML.</p>
