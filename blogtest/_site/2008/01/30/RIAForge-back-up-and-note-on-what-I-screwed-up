<h1>Post</h1>

<p>Thanks to everyone for pointing out that RIAForge was down today. Where's all the email when the sites <i>aren't</i> down, eh??? ;)</p>
<p>So what was wrong? The site uses a temporary folder to store data extracted from SVN when folks view/download from Subversion via the web site.</p>
<p>Guess what - that temporary folder had not been emptied since the dawn of Man.</p>
<p>Yes - this is something I've blogged about before - watching disk space - and I've just been bitten by it myself!</p>
