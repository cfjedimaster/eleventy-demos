<p>Word: Query Anxiety</p>
<p>Definition: The feeling you get in your gut when you are running a query and also dumping it and you realize you screwed up the SQL and your about to get about 10000 records displayed on screen.</p>
<p>Not that I've ever done that. Really. Pardon me while I shut down/restart Firefox and get back a few gigs of RAM.</p>
