<p>Just a quick note to let folks know I'd be a bit quiet this week. Got a major project I'm trying to wrap, and I'll be out of the office tomorrow for Mardi Gras. (CFBL report will be on Wednesday.) And finally - congrats to the Giants! Although I blame their win for the inordinate amount of beers I drank last night. Curse Sam Adams and his brew!</p>
