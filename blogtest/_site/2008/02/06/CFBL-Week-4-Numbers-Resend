<p>Wow, who knew that iWork didn't have an auto-save? When I had to force quit my Mac this morning, I wasn't worried about my copy of Numbers running as I assumed it had auto-saved my changes. I love Numbers compared to Excel, but I'm a bit surprised that such an obvious feature doesn't exist.</p>
<p>So anyway - if you sent me numbers for Week 4, please resend to me. Sorry! (I blame Mardi Gras.)</p>
