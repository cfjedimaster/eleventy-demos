<p>I've been blogging quite a bit lately on cfchart and other charting options. I just ran across a blog post by Gary Gilbert that may be of interest:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.garyrgilbert.com/blog/index.cfm/2008/2/8/JFree-Chart-Custom-Tag">JFree Chart Custom Tag</a></p>
<p>He discusses his work on creating a CFML wrapper to the free <a href="http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/">JFreeChart</a> project.</p>
<p>Yet another option for folks to consider if they aren't happy with cfchart.</p>
