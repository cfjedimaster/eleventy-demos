<h1>Post</h1>

<p>Earlier yesterday morning I <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2008/2/7/Ask-a-Jedi-CFCHART-Question">blogged</a> about cfchart and a poster asked an interesting followup question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I have another cfchart question (Maybe I am cheating by tacking it on here). I tried to chart some data based on ranked lists, like a bestseller list. I wanted to chart the position of a "book" on the list over the weeks. On the list, 1 is higher than 2 is higher than 10, so when it charted it came out upside down. I didn't see anything in the cfchart attributes that allowed me to invert this.
<p>I have to admit, it wasn't a crucial need to chart this so I moved on to other problems, but it has sort of bugged me since then. Was I missing something easy?</p>

His name was Magnus, and there was no way I could ignore a question from someone with a cool name like that. First let me demonstrate what he is talking about. I created some data that represented books and their ranks over a five week period:
<code>
&lt;cfscript&gt;
function addIt(week,book,position) {
	queryAddRow(data);
	querySetCell(data, "week", arguments.week);
	querySetCell(data, "book", arguments.book);
	querySetCell(data, "position", arguments.position);
<p>}
data = queryNew(&quot;week,book,position&quot;,&quot;integer,varchar,integer&quot;);</p>
<p>addIt(1,&quot;Alpha&quot;,1);
addIt(2,&quot;Alpha&quot;,2);
addIt(3,&quot;Alpha&quot;,1);
addIt(4,&quot;Alpha&quot;,4);
addIt(5,&quot;Alpha&quot;,5);</p>
<p>addIt(1,&quot;Beta&quot;,3);
addIt(2,&quot;Beta&quot;,1);
addIt(3,&quot;Beta&quot;,2);
addIt(4,&quot;Beta&quot;,2);
addIt(5,&quot;Beta&quot;,1);</p>
<p>addIt(1,&quot;Gamma&quot;,5);
addIt(2,&quot;Gamma&quot;,4);
addIt(3,&quot;Gamma&quot;,3);
addIt(4,&quot;Gamma&quot;,1);
addIt(5,&quot;Gamma&quot;,2);
&lt;/cfscript&gt;
</code></p>
<p>The UDF is there simply to save me some typing. I then created the chart:</p>
<code>
&lt;cfchart show3d="false" &gt;
	&lt;cfloop index="book" list="#valueList(data.book)#"&gt;
		&lt;cfquery name="weekdata" dbtype="query"&gt;
		select	*
		from	data
		where	book = &lt;cfqueryparam cfsqltype="cf_sql_varchar" value="#book#"&gt;
		order by week
		&lt;/cfquery&gt;
		&lt;cfchartseries type="line" query="weekdata" itemcolumn="week" valuecolumn="position" serieslabel="#book#"&gt;
	&lt;/cfloop&gt;
&lt;/cfchart&gt;
</code>
<p>The result is a bit hard to read in static JPG format, but has nice roll overs in Flash. When I used a legend, it got a bit screwy. I'll come back to that. But as you can see, the grid starts with lower numbers first:</p>

<p>Once again I turned to the handy dandy chart editor. After a bit of clicking I finally found what I wanted under YAxis (duh). Clicking on this setting gives you a lot of options for the YAxis, including a &quot;Is Reversed&quot; tick. The resulting XML gives you:</p>
<code>
&lt;frameChart is3D="false"&gt;
          &lt;yAxis isReversed="true"&gt;
          &lt;/yAxis&gt;
		&lt;legend isVisible="false" showColumnLegend="false"&gt;
               &lt;decoration style="None"/&gt;
          &lt;/legend&gt;
&lt;/frameChart&gt;
</code>
<p>Note - I did tweak a bit more, like turning off the column legend which was turned back on by the XML. This gives you the result you want - kinda:</p>

<p>As you can see, we still have a range of 1-5. I tried like heck to fix this. There is even a range option in the chart editor, but the data seems to override this. You can supply a gridlines of 5. That does give you the right number of lines, but check out the result:</p>

<p>Not what I'd call optimal, but I'll take a look at this a bit more later to see if I can figure this last step out. Here is the complete code of the latest version:</p>
<code>
<p>&lt;cfscript&gt;
function addIt(week,book,position) {
queryAddRow(data);
querySetCell(data, &quot;week&quot;, arguments.week);
querySetCell(data, &quot;book&quot;, arguments.book);
querySetCell(data, &quot;position&quot;, arguments.position);</p>
<p>}
data = queryNew(&quot;week,book,position&quot;,&quot;integer,varchar,integer&quot;);</p>
<p>addIt(1,&quot;Alpha&quot;,1);
addIt(2,&quot;Alpha&quot;,2);
addIt(3,&quot;Alpha&quot;,1);
addIt(4,&quot;Alpha&quot;,4);
addIt(5,&quot;Alpha&quot;,5);</p>
<p>addIt(1,&quot;Beta&quot;,3);
addIt(2,&quot;Beta&quot;,1);
addIt(3,&quot;Beta&quot;,2);
addIt(4,&quot;Beta&quot;,2);
addIt(5,&quot;Beta&quot;,1);</p>
<p>addIt(1,&quot;Gamma&quot;,5);
addIt(2,&quot;Gamma&quot;,4);
addIt(3,&quot;Gamma&quot;,3);
addIt(4,&quot;Gamma&quot;,1);
addIt(5,&quot;Gamma&quot;,2);
&lt;/cfscript&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;cfsavecontent variable=&quot;style&quot;&gt;
&lt;frameChart is3D=&quot;false&quot;&gt;
&lt;yAxis isReversed=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
&lt;/yAxis&gt;
&lt;legend isVisible=&quot;false&quot; showColumnLegend=&quot;false&quot;&gt;
&lt;decoration style=&quot;None&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/legend&gt;
&lt;/frameChart&gt;
&lt;/cfsavecontent&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;cfchart show3d=&quot;false&quot; style=&quot;#style#&quot; gridlines=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;cfloop index=&quot;book&quot; list=&quot;#valueList(data.book)#&quot;&gt;
&lt;cfquery name=&quot;weekdata&quot; dbtype=&quot;query&quot;&gt;
select	*
from	data
where	book = &lt;cfqueryparam cfsqltype=&quot;cf_sql_varchar&quot; value=&quot;#book#&quot;&gt;
order by week
&lt;/cfquery&gt;
&lt;cfchartseries type=&quot;line&quot; query=&quot;weekdata&quot; itemcolumn=&quot;week&quot; valuecolumn=&quot;position&quot; serieslabel=&quot;#book#&quot;&gt;
&lt;/cfloop&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;/cfchart&gt;
