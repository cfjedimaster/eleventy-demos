Hi, I am learning from you article and havea a requirement to create and email/print PDF file out of an online html report.
I am trying the code bellow, but it doesn't work. What am I doing wrong? Would you let me know, please, how to make it work?
</p>

<p>Let's take a look at his code:</p>
<code>
&lt;cfdocument format="PDF" name="c:\temp\myReport"&gt; 
&lt;html&gt; 
... my html report is here ... 
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/cfdocument&gt; 
<p>&lt;cfpdf action=&quot;write&quot; source=&quot;c:\temp\myReport&quot;
destination=&quot;c:\temp\myPDF.pdf&quot;&gt;
</code></p>
<p>I hate to say RTFM, but this is a perfect case where it would have helped. The docs for CFDOCUMENT state that the name attribute allows you to specify a variable to store the PDF created. It isn't a filename, but rather a variable name. If you run the code, the error makes mention of it: The string c:\temp\myReport is not a valid ColdFusion variable name.</p>
<p>The solution is simple - switch to filename.</p>
