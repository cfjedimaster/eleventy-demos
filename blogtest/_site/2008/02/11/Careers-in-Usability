She isn't a programmer, but is interested in doing work in usability. I've little experience with this myself, outside of some exposure I've gotten over the years working on web sites.</p>
<p>So the question for my readers is - what would be a recommended way for someone to get into the field? Does it even make sense as a 'at home' type job? Any ORA books on the topic? Any and all advice would be appreciated. (As the coffee lady would say - &quot;Talk amongst yourselves!&quot;)</p>
