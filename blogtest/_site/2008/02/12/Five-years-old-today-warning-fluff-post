Back then, BlogCFC wasn't released, as I said in that first entry:</p>

FYI, most of this blog is run via a CFC. I plan on sharing the code sometime tomorrow - after I get done adding a search method.

<p>I guess using a CFC was kind of a cool thing. ;) A lot has changed since that first post. We've had a few new versions of ColdFusion, quite a few open source applications released, and I've passed through more than one job since then as well. I hope the next five years are just as enjoyable for everyone else as they were for me.</p>
