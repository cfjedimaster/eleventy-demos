<p>Now that I've caught up on my sleep (I'm never doing two trips in a row at 6AM!) I wanted to send a quick shout out to the <a href="http://www.nycfug.com/home.cfm">NYCFUG</a> for their hospitality and warm welcome (despite the blizzard) Tuesday night. I had a great time presenting on CFFEED and all it's fun little &quot;issues&quot;. For pictures from the event, see Ben's <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/bennadel/NYCFUGFebruary122008">Picasa album</a>. (Be sure to note my cool Star Wars shirt.)</p>
<p>I slept close to 10 hours last night so I'm still behind on email. If you sent me anything urgent, it may be a day or two before I can respond.</p>
