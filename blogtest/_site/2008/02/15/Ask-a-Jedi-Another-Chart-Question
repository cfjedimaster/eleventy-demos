<p>Woohoo! I love these chart questions. I guess I'm a chart geek. Randy asks:</p>

Is there a way for the bottom labels on a cfchart to show vertically on the graph instead of horizontal.

<p>I bet folks know what I'm going to say. Once again, the built in chart editor comes in handy. This one was pretty simple - I just changed the XAxis/Style/Label/Orientation setting to Vertical. I grabbed the XML and edited it like so:</p>
<p>
<code>
&lt;frameChart&gt;
&lt;xAxis&gt;
&lt;labelStyle orientation="Vertical"/&gt;
&lt;/xAxis&gt;
&lt;/frameChart&gt;		
</code>
<p>
<p>Passing this to my chart resulted in the following:</p>
