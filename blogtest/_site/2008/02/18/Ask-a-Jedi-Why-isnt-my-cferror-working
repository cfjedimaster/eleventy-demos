Huge problem I have: custom Error Handling in CF 8 doesn't work whatever I do. I use a simple Application.cfm: 
<p>&lt;cferror type=&quot;exception&quot;
template=&quot;ErrorException.cfm&quot; mailto=&quot;info@mysite.com&quot;&gt;</p>
<p>ErrorException.cfm exists and is NOT empty</p>
<p>The template generating the error is index.cfm:<br />
&lt;cfoutput&gt;#i#</p>
<p>Is there any other setting I have to enable/disable in CF Admin for this to work? I still get the default CF error message, nothing custom.</p>
</p>

<p>What you have is a compiler error, or a syntax error. Consider the normal CF execution process. You request index.cfm. CF takes your ColdFusion and compiles it into Java. In your case, you have a syntax error. CF can't run your code at all - therefore - error handling can't handle it at all. The only fix for your template is to remove the syntax error. If you then ran your file and &quot;i&quot; was never defined, you would correctly see your error template run.</p>
<p>If I may be so bold (yes, I'll do), you should check out my guide on error handling:</p>
