<p>This morning I was interviewed on the <a href="http://www.thedigitalmediadude.com/">Digital Media Dude</a> about my experiences in converting to the Mac. You can hear my lovely, gravely voice <a href="http://www.thedigitalmediadude.com/2008/02/22/confession-2-raymond-camden-web-developer-turned-born-again-mac-user/">here</a> as I mumble semi-coherently about life as a Mac-head. Now pardon me while I recover by playin some WoW.</p>
