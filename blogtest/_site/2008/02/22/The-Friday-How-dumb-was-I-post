<p>So I'm going to blame this on my head cold, but yesterday I spent a good hour trying to figure out why my code was failing. The code did (essentially):</p>
<code>
&lt;cfset result = util.getRetVal(a,b)&gt;
</code>
<p>I cfdumped util. I clearly saw getRetVal. I even get anal. I created a new instance of the CFC (util was actually an Application scoped CFC placed in a view) and called it there and got the same error. I then deleted every other method but getRetVal and it still didn't work.</p>
<p>For a good sixty minutes I beat my head against the wall. If I were a laptop, my fan would have sounded like a jet engine. I then showed it to Todd Sharp. We hashed it back and forth a bit when he mentioned he had no trouble calling getRetValue.</p>
<p>See it? Let me say it again: getRetVal<b>ue</b>.</p>
<p>Ugh. Over an hour wasted because I used Val instead of Value. Nice.</p>
