<p>A few days ago I <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2008/2/20/Spry-update-on-the-way">mentioned</a> that a Spry update was forthcoming. The new version, tagged as a minor update to 1.6.1, has been <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/spry/">released</a>. Please note that while the web site implies that this is only an AIR-related update, that is certainly <b>not</b> the case. The way cool &quot;function display&quot; feature (not sure of the real name, that's what I'm calling it) has been added as well as the rating widget. I'll be blogging some examples of this, but will be doing so at <a href="http://www.insideria.com">InsideRIA</a>, so be sure to follow the posts there.</p>
