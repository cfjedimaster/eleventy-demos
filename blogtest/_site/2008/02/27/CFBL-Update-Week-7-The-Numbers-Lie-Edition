<p>Ok honestly, that &quot;edition&quot; really makes no sense. Anyway, here is the report from week 7. I had a <i>great</i> week - 5 pounds lost. Pretty surprising since I was sick for the last half of the week and didn't do as much exercise.</p>
<p>Week 7 weight total: 4,470
Week 7 weight average: 235.26
Week 7 lowest: 179
Week 7 highest: 385
