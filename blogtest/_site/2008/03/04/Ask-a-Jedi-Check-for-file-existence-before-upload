<p>
I have some code that allows a user to upload a file. 
Upon upload I build a file name and store it in a database.
The people it is uploaded to will take it massage it and return it to use via a folder that I monitor. Once a see a file I match it to the Database and download it.
<p>my problem is that the users will want to re-upload the same file for various reasons. I have the &quot;return&quot; process checking
for matching files and moving the original to a separate folder, however I would like to check in the upload process to see if the file I am about to upload already exists and if so give the use the opportunity to abort the upload and
rename the file</p>

So the answer to this is... kinda. You have a few things you can consider. First off - you can simply put all uploads in a temporary holding folder. If the file isn't a duplicate, move it out. If it is, simply present the user a form to make them give it a new name. The only thing you want to watch out for is users simply leaving your application. You would want to periodically clean the holding folder. 
<p>Another way to handle this is with AJAX. JavaScript doesn't let you do much with a file upload field. You can't change it for example. But you can read it. Consider the following code:</p>
<code>
&lt;cfajaxproxy cfc="filetest" jsclassname="filetest"&gt;
<p>&lt;script&gt;
var myFileTest = new filetest();</p>
<p>function testFile(f) {
var value = f.value;
if(value != '') {
if(myFileTest.exists(value)) alert('This file already exists.');		
}
}
&lt;/script&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;form action=&quot;&quot; method=&quot;post&quot; enctype=&quot;multipart/form-data&quot;&gt;
&lt;input type=&quot;file&quot; name=&quot;upload&quot; onChange=&quot;testFile(this)&quot;&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></p>
<p>I've bound an onChange event to my fileUpload field. I grab the value, and if there is something there, I do an Ajax call to a CFC named filetest. The value is only the filename, not the complete folder. In my CFC I do:</p>
<code>
&lt;cfcomponent output="false"&gt;
<p>&lt;cffunction name=&quot;exists&quot; access=&quot;remote&quot; returnType=&quot;boolean&quot; output=&quot;false&quot;&gt;
&lt;cfargument name=&quot;file&quot; type=&quot;string&quot; required=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
&lt;cfreturn fileExists(expandPath(&quot;./&quot; &amp; arguments.file))&gt;
&lt;/cffunction&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;/cfcomponent&gt;
</code></p>
<p>Now this code could be rife for abuse. You would want to make sure that it only checks a folder you don't mind the entire world knowing about. But you get the idea. As soon as a user selects a file, the code will see if a file with the same name exists. You could then create a form field to ask the user for a new name.</p>
