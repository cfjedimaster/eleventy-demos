<p>Had quite a drop in participation this week - but some folks tend to stop reporting and come back, so hopefully things will pick up for these last 3 reports. Anyway, here are the stats:</p>
<p>Week 8 weight total: 2,846<br>
Week 8 weight average: 218.92<br>
Week 8 lowest: 178<br>
Week 8 highest: 315<br>
People this week: 13<br>
Biggest Loser (Pounds): Joel Stobart (5 lbs)<br>
Biggest Loser (%): Joel Stobart ( 2.73 %)<br>
Total Weight Lost: 20<br></p>
<p>I didn't lose anything at all this week - but that was - once again - due to the weekend. I think I'm going to have to bite the bullet and exercise on Saturday as well. I am eating better, but I think the 2 days without exercise is killing me. Already I'm down 4 pounds today, and I'm sure I'll be the same on Friday, I just need to keep it off. 210 is soooo close now.</p>
