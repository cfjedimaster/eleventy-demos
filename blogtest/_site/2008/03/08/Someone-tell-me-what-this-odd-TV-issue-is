<p>So I'm watching cartoons with my kids this morning and the last cartoon only had secondary audio. By that I mean background music. No voices at all. My kids didn't complain, and I explained to them that something was wrong at the cable company probably.</p>
<p>But now something really weird is going on. A new cartoon is on - the voices are back - but there is a voice of a guy describing the action. It's almost like a service for blind people. It doesn't repeat voices - it just describes things you wouldn't know if you couldn't see the visuals.</p>
<p>Anyone know what this?</p>
