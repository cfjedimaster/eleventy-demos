<blockquote>
What's a better development environment?
<p>For those of us that use a local development environment, is there any advantage to using CF Dev Edition's built-in JRun
server, vs. installing IIS on Windows XP and using that?</p>
<p>I just looked at my task manager, and JRun is using a whopping 220 MB of memory, without having been accessed since I booted, completely idle. That's far more than anything else currently running on my system.</p>

When it comes to a development environment, I think most people feel that the best rule is that it should match, as much as possible, the production environment. I don't think it is expected that it would be an exact match. Production would probably be Windows Server 2003 and development would be Windows XP, but you get the idea.
<p>With that being said - you should not be using the built-in JRun web server for production. Therefore I'd recommend against it in development as well.</p>
<p>However - IIS is a bit of a pain. Unless you are willing to google and look up a hack, you can't run multiple virtual web servers with IIS under XP. Now if all you work on is one site, that's no big deal. If you are a contractor and work on multiple sites, you really want that multiple server setup. That's why I use Apache (well, I'm on a Mac now so I kind of have to, but even before I switched I used Apache). The only time the difference between Apache and IIS has bit me in the butt is with CGI variables.</p>
