<p>Tomorrow I'll be presenting for the <a href="http://coldfusion.meetup.com/17">Online ColdFusion Meetup Group</a> at 11AM CST. Meeting information may be found <a href="http://coldfusion.meetup.com/17/calendar/7517172/">here</a>. I'll be presenting on ColdFusion 8's image functionality. This is an online meeting so anyone can attend.</p>
<p>Next week I'll be up in the Bay Area presenting at <a href="http://www.bacfug.org">BACFUG</a>. I've decided to scrap the presentation on Spry and instead talk about Silverlight and PHP development. I hope that's cool.</p>
