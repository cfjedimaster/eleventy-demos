<h1>Post</h1>

<p>Unfortunately I never got around to zipping up my files from my presentation last week. I had a copy on my laptop (I'm traveling now) and while it's a bit old, in general it should be very close to what I demonstrated. I removed all the original images though to help keep the zip file size down, so you will need to replace the images used in the original code.</p>
<p>Sorry again for the delay!<p><a href='enclosures/D%3A%5Chosts%5Cwww%2Ecoldfusionjedi%2Ecom%5Cenclosures%2Fimages%20copy%2Ezip'>Download attached file.</a></p></p>
