<p>Thanks to Ed Tabara for pointing this out. If you type &quot;1&quot; in the search field at <a href="http://www.coldfusionbloggers.org">ColdFusion Bloggers</a>, you will get a JavaScript error:</p>
<blockquote>

The page at http://www.coldfusionbloggers.org says:Bind failed for autosuggest search_query, bind value is not a 1D array of strings [Enable debugging by adding 'cfdebug' to your URL parameters to see more information]
</p>

<p>If you introspect the result from my server, you see something like this:</p>
<p>[10.0,123.0,&quot;1ssblog&quot;,&quot;1smartsolution&quot;]</p>
<p>Notice that the first two results were numbers, not strings. I tried to 'fool' JSON a bit. I added &quot;&quot; to the number to see if that would do it and it didn't work. Interestingly enough, if you add &quot; &quot; to your data, serializeJSON will keep the padding on the strings, but removes it from the numbers. So even though my data was &quot;10(space)&quot;, serializeJSON ignored it.</p>
<p>So it looks like 2 possible bugs. The client side code should allow for any simple value in the array - numbers, strings, or dates. And it looks like maybe serializeJSON is a bit overzealous in converting values. I can understand converting 10 to 10.0, but &quot;10(space)&quot; should be left alone, especially if &quot;Ray(space)&quot; is left alone.</p>
