<p>That's it. Nothing meaningful here. Just a big, giant, virtual slap to my own face for avoiding these tools for so long. They are in use at my current contract and I can't believe  I avoided learning them for so long. It's like I've been using my hands to drink for all my life and just discovered the amazing invention known as &quot;cups&quot;. Not just useful - but kinda stupid to avoid using.</p>
