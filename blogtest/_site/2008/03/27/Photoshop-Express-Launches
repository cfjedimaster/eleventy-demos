<p>Photoshop Express, an online image manipulation service, has launched today. This was demoed at the last MAX and was pretty impressive looking. They also give you 2 gigs of image storage. I'm surprised though that it doesn't integrate with Share (is anything happening with Share?) though. Oddly - you don't use your normal Adobe login, but must create a new account. I signed up about an hour ago but haven't gotten my confirmation email yet.</p>
