<p>I just released version 2.012 of <a href="http://galleon.riaforge.org">Galleon</a>. This update adds <a href="http://markitup.jaysalvat.com/home/">markitup</a> support. This is a very cool editor that makes it easy to build support for different languages, including BBML which Galleon supports.</p>
<p>Now - I know I'm anti rich-text editor, but this one was so nice and slim, so elegant, that I couldn't say no to it. Plus, <a href="http://www.web-rat.com/">Todd Rafferty</a> actually did all the coding, so all I had to do was look it over. He also nicely turned it into a config setting so folks could turn the feature off if they wanted.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I don't have my personal <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/forums">forums</a> updated to 2.x yet, but I'll see if I can get <a href="http://www.geekthetube.com/forums">GTT</a>'s forums updated.</p>
