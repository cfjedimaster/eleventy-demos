<p>I don't know why I never did this - but today I tweaked the &quot;My Projects&quot; view at RIAForge to be more generic. You can now share your project list with others, and view projects by users as well. For example, here is Rob Gonda's <a href="http://ajaxcfc.riaforge.org/index.cfm?event=page.myprojects&id=22">list</a> and here is my <a href="http://www.riaforge.org/index.cfm?event=page.myprojects&id=15">list</a>. Each project now will have a link to all the projects for an author.</p>
