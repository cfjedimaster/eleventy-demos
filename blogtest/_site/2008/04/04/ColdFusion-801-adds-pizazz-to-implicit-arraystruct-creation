<p>One of my favorite features in ColdFusion 8 is the ability to create and populate structs and arrays in one line of code:</p>
<code>
&lt;cfset a = ["paris","britney","lindsey"]&gt;
&lt;cfset s = {name="Raymond",age="Almost 35",weight="204"}&gt;
</code>
<p>This is <i>so</i> darn useful I can't imagine life without it.</p>
<p>ColdFusion 8.0.1 makes this even better by letting you nest these implicit creations:</p>
<code>
&lt;cfset s = {name="Raymond",age="Almost 35",weight="204",kids=["Jacob","Lynn","Noah"]}&gt;
&lt;cfdump var="#s#"&gt;	
</code>
<p>Which results in:</p>

<p>Now obviously you don't want to go crazy with this. You still want to keep things readable!</p>
<p>(Sorry for all the blog entries. I can't sleep and I figured I'd share some of my favorite parts of 8.0.1.)</p>
