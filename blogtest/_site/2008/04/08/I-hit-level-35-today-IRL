<p>After grinding through various monsters and quests over the past 365 days, today I finally gained enough experience to hit level 35. Or in other words - it's my birthday! I don't quite feel 35 though. Something tells me I'll be getting a few Star Wars related presents today which means I can't be <i>too</i> old, right? My biggest present to myself though will be skipping the treadmill this morning and just taking it easy for a day.</p>
