<p>I'm a bit late in posting this, but Joe has done a <a href="http://www.firemoss.com/blog/index.cfm/2008/4/9/MG3-Video-Sneak-Peak--Event-Generation">video preview</a> of Model-Glue 3. The video shows off:</p>
<ul>
<li>Code generation for unknown events (which I have a problem with, and posted my concerns on his blog)
<li>SES urls out of the box
<li>Notice in the video, in his view, he uses Event, which I think is a great change. It was confusing going from Event to ViewState even though they were basically the same object
</ul>}
