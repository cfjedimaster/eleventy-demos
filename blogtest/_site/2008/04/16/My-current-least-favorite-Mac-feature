<p>Time for a quick rant. In general, I love that I've left the Windows world behind. I love OSX. But - like my own software, it isn't perfect. Today I want to complain about something that has bugged me since I first switched.</p>
<p>Why is it that every time I install software, the Mac does a volume check? By that I mean this screen:</p>

<p>The fact that it asks me what drive to install too doesn't bug me. What bugs me is that it <i>immediately</i> finds my main hard drive, but then I wait for 3-4 seconds while it searches for other volumes. I know 3-4 seconds isn't a long time, but it just annoys the heck out of me. I want to immediately hit &quot;Macintosh HD&quot; and hit next to continue on with the install.</p>
<p>Anyone know if this is a configurable setting?</p>
