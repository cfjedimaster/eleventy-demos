<h1>Post</h1>

<p>I've &quot;formally&quot; released the new version of my YouTube CFC to <a href="http://youtubecfc.riaforge.org">it's RIAForge home</a>. This new version doesn't have a one to one relation to the older API so I've included the old code in the zip as well. Right now it supports:</p>
<ul>
<li>Various 'top' video feeds (most popular, etc)
<li>Videos by category, keyword, or both
<li>Videos by user
<li>Comments for a video
<li>Playlists for a user
<li>Videos for a playlist
</ul>
<p>And of course the big one - video upload.</p>
<p>The major things left to do include posting new comments and updating video information. Hopefully I can get the <a href="http://apiblog.youtube.com/">YouTube API Blog</a> folks to notice.</p>
