<p>I have to admit that I'm kind of a - dare I say - diva - when it comes to forms. I prefer to type them out and do all the validation by hand. In the past I've written form 'helpers' to handle generating and validating forms (*), but I haven't done that for quite some time. I feel like I've written a few million forms in my life time, and I'm sure I'll write a few million more.</p>
<p>This week a coworker introduced me to <a href="http://www.wufoo.com/">WuFoo</a>. WuFoo is an online form service. As you can guess, it lets you build forms and host them on their server. It handles storing and processing all the results.</p>
<p>What is truly slick is how they handle all the editing. Everything is drag drop, so to add a form field you simply drag over the type of form field you need. You can then double click on the field to edit the label, set requirement status, etc.</p>
<p>It has a slick reporting UI as well. I can build a form with a radio button and design a form that uses a pie chart to display the results.</p>
<p>When would I use this? Probably never as I know I can whip out a quick form in a few seconds. But for folks who don't have access to Me (I'm not cheap ;) or may not even have a web site, this is sweet service.</p>
<p>Feel free to play with the <a href="http://cfjedimaster.wufoo.com/forms/my-first-form/">form</a> I created.</p>
