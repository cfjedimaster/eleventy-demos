<p>My last <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2008/5/2/cfObjective-Keynote-News-on-Centaur-CF9">blog entry</a> on the keynote at cfObjective had to be cut short, but I wanted to make sure folks got the news. Jason Delmore didn't get a chance to talk on it, but the slide was very clear. The &quot;ColdFusion Open Process Initiative&quot; will include both a public bug and enhancement request system. This is something people have been asking about for quite some time.</p>
