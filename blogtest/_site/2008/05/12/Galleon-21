<p>I just released <a href="http://galleon.riaforge.org">Galleon 2.1</a>. The major change in this release is Oracle support from James Holmes. I did <b>not</b> document this in the Install instructions as I'm hoping a few Oracle folks out there (poor souls I'm sure) can give it a quick try. I also fixed a deletion bug. Oracle folks - please do not use the unsupported folder. Oracle support is completely baked in.</p>
