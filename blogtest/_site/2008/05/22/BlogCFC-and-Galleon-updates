<p>I had decided to not work anymore on BlogCFC 5, but with 6 being delayed so long, I gave some love to the 5.X code base tonight. <a href="http://blogcfc.riaforge.org">BlogCFC</a> 5.9.003 was released tonight. Nothing major was changed, but I did switch to <a href="http://coldfish.riaforge.org">ColdFish</a>, the code syntax highlighter written by Jason Delmore. This replaces the ancient code I had in there before.</p>
<p>Also released was an update to <a href="http://galleon.riaforge.org">Galleon</a>. This release fixes an issue related to the past security changes as well as a case sensitivity issue. (Sorry, but you will never convince me case sensitive file systems make sense. Who in the heck wants a file named foo.txt and Foo.txt??)</p>
<p>I also want to point out an interesting article by Ike: <a href="http://ontap.riaforge.org/blog/index.cfm/2008/5/22/Galleon">Porting Galleon Forums</a>. He is porting Galleon to various frameworks and will be posting about the process.</p>
