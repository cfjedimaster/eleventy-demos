<p>A few days ago I was debugging an issue with <a href="http://canvas.riaforge.org">Canvas</a> when I ran across an interesting issue with CFFILE, action=upload. The user reported that the files he uploaded via the wiki were not visible. With some debugging, I found that files named foo.whatever ended up being upload to a folder with the same name as the filename, so instead of having the file end up here:</p>
<!--more-->
<code>
uploadsfolder/foo.whatever
</code>
<p>They ended up here:</p>
<code>
uploadsfolder/foo.whatever/foo.whatever
</code>
<p>After an hour or so of debugging, I finally noticed something. The code to handle the uploads was specifying a path <i>and</i> filename for the destination. The docs for cffile/action=upload say that destination has to be directory. But apparently this has worked for quite sometime, <b>except</b> in ColdFusion 7.0.1 where the behavior was broken. This <a href="http://kb.adobe.com/selfservice/viewContent.do?externalId=f97044e&sliceId=1">hotfix</a> was released just to correct this issue.</p>
<p>This is probably just one more little facet of CFML I've forgotten, although I will say the docs should be updated to make this more clear.</p>
