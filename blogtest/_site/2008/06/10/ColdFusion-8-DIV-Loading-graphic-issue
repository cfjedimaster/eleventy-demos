<p>Here is something interesting I just ran into. One of my open bugs at <a href="http://www.broadchoice.com">work</a> involve adding a &quot;Loading&quot; graphic to an ajax container. The code in question uses CFDIV and hits up a CFC to load the data.</p>
<p>I thought about it this for a second and thought to myself, &quot;Self - doesn't CF8 automatically do loading graphics?&quot;</p>
<p>I whipped up a quick test to confirm this:</p>
<code>
&lt;cfdiv bind="url:test3.cfm" /&gt;
</code>
<p>and test3.cfm just did:</p>
<code>
&lt;cfset sleep(5000)&gt;
test 3
</code>
<p>When I ran this I plainly saw a loading message and graphic. So why wasn't it working in our product? I noticed that the code used cfc:, not url:, so I quickly modified my test:</p>
<code>
cfc:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;cfdiv bind="cfc:test.getslow()" /&gt;
<p>&lt;p&gt;
url:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;cfdiv bind=&quot;url:test3.cfm&quot; /&gt;
</code></p>
<p>The CFC method getslow did the same thing test3.cfm did. When I ran this I saw:</p>

<p>As you can see, the CFC based one has no form of loading message while the URL one does. I could switch to a URL based CFC call, but this is rather odd. I can't see why one form of remote call would get a message and another would not.</p>
