<p>I know we are all (well, I am!) getting excited about <a href="http://www.cfunited">CFUNITED</a>, but I also want to point out another conference coming up in September, <a href="http://www.cfdevcon.com/">CFDevcon</a>. This will be held in Brighton, England, from September 25-26. I was invited to speak this year, but will not be able to make it. However, there is a darn good list of <a href="http://www.cfdevcon.com/speakers.cfm">speakers</a> lined up.</p>
<p>Is it just me - or is there quite a bit of ColdFusion-lovin' going on in the conference world? I keep threatening to help bring back CFSOUTH, but that's only because I want to travel to a conference that is a bit closer to my home town. ;)</p>
