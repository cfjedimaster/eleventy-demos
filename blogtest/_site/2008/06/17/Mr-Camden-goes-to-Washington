<h1>Post</h1>

<p>I'm happy to say that I arrived safe and sound - and with no delays - in beautiful Washington, D.C. I'm sitting around in my hotel room letting my lunch settle and drinking a gallon of coffee to help make up for my 3AM wake up. I'm <b>very</b> excited about CFUNITED started. To add to the excitement - the first person to knock on my hotel door gets a copy of WACK 2 or WACK 3. Of course, figuring out what hotel room I'm in will be the fun part.</p>
