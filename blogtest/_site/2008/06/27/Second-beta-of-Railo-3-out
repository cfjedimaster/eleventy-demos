<p>Just read this on the Railo 3 listserv. The second beta is out. A few new features were added, including the shorthand array/struct support CF8 has and cfdocument/cfpdf support. One really interesting update is the ability to specify where unscoped variables go in a UDF. Consider this example:</p>
<code>
&lt;cfscript&gt;
function doit(y) {
	x = 2;
	return x*y;
}
&lt;/cfscript&gt;
<p>&lt;cfoutput&gt;#doit(5)#&lt;/cfoutput&gt;
&lt;cfdump var=&quot;#variables#&quot;&gt;
</code></p>
<p>As you can see, I have an unscoped X variable. When I dump the Variables scope, I see doit and X. However, I can now jump into the Railo Admin...</p>

<p>when I change the setting to &quot;Always&quot; as you see in the screen shot, now the x variable is automatically placed in the var scope instead.</p>
<p>You can grab the latest build (for all OSes) <a href="http://www.railo-technologies.com/en/index.cfm?treeID=361">here</a>.</p>
