<p>I ran across an interesting issue with gmail this morning. I was logging into my Broadchoice hosted mail account. Those of you who use Gmail for your hosted mail know that the form looks something like so:</p>
<p>Username:<br />
input text field here<br />
@broadchoice.com<br />
Password:</p>
<p>Note line 3 above. Below the text field for your username is @broadchoice.com, or @yourhost.com. This is implying that you should enter your username only and not the full email address.</p>
<p>Being early in the morning (and still suffering with a sinus infection) I accidentally typed in my full email address. I got an error back stating that my username could not include any symbols or other characters.</p>
<p>Wouldn't it have been nice (and relatively simple) for gmail to say &quot;Your username included the hostname for the account, I'll just strip that out.&quot;</p>
<p>Do folks do this? Is this a good idea? I'd be willing to bet that folks do that (by accident) quite a bit.</p>
<p>The only example I know of within my code is for BlogCFC and the comment box. When you add a comment you have the option to enter a URL. I write &quot;http://&quot; in the field so you don't have to worry about entering it in. At the same time, I don't bother validating if the field still reads &quot;http://&quot;. It's nicer than forcing the user to delete the field if they have no intention of using it.</p>
