<p>I recently noticed a large of odd messages in my coldfusion-event.log. They all looked something like so:</p>
<p>06/26 14:47:27 error Cannot create cookie: domain = .riaforge.org</p>
<p>This error was <i>not</i> on the RIAForge box but my own personal server (this machine). I asked about this on a listserv and got a lot of good responses, but it seems like the final answer is this:</p>
<p><a href="http://jochem.vandieten.net/2008/07/03/reserved-names-for-cookies/">Reserved Names for Cookies</a></p>
<p>I'm sharing this in case others run into it as well. When I say &quot;large&quot;, I mean quite a bit. In fact it seemed to be the primary content of the entire log.</p>
<p>Please post comments on Jochem's blog though. I've already posted a followup question there myself.</p>
