<p>This is just a quick note to point out the example on the Railo Blog on their cluster scope:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.railo.ch/blog/index.cfm/2008/7/6/Cluster-Scope">Railo Blog: Cluster Scope</a></p>
<p>Read the blog entry for details, but basically it boils down to server A registering server B and vice versa. After which you can then use Cluster as a scope on either machine. Set cluster.x to 1 on machine A and machine B can read it. What's impressive is that you can also use the admin to determine if the updates have failed.</p>
