<p>So this is news to me. In preparation for talking about the Lemonade Stand results tomorrow, I worked a bit more on the reporting for my simulator. Since I love charts, I plopped a chart down at the end that shows each stand and how it performs over all 50 days. I knew I was going to want to share the complete chart on the blog post, so I switched from the default Flash format to PNG. When I moused over the chart though I noticed the tool tips still worked! Here is an example:</p>

<p>Turns out that for both PNG and JPG formats, the charting engine will actually output an image map and support the same tool tips you get with the Flash version.</p>
<p>Nice to know. I mean, in my case my plan is to save the PNG/JPG, so it won't help, but if you can't use Flash for other reasons, you can still have an interactive chart. (Note - I just tested the URL property and it works fine as well for PNG/JPG.)</p>
