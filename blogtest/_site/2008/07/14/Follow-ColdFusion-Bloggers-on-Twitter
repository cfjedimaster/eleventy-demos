<p>I'm using <a href="http://twitterclient.riaforge.org/">Twitter Client</a> by Elliott Sprehn. If you view <i>all</i> the twits on the account you will see some older entries which come from my testing. Also - I'd love to change the picture if someone can suggest something (as opposed to another picture of me).</p>
