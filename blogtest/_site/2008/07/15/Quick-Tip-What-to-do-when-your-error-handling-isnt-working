<p>Two quick things you should check when your error handling isn't working right.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Make sure your error handler doesn't have a bug itself. A good example of this is an error handler that sends a report to application.adminEmail. If your error occurs in application startup, before application.adminEmail is set, then it is no surprise that your error handler would fail as well. <b>Suggestion:</b> Make your error handler as simple as possible. Just a &quot;Something is wrong&quot; text message. If that helps, then the error is in your error handler.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ColdFusion's error handler won't handle syntax errors like so: &lt;cfsearch collection=&quot;cfdocs&quot; criteria=&quot;cfabort and name=&quot;res&quot;&gt;. Notice that the criteria attribute doesn't properly end? <b>Suggestion:</b> Look at the error message. It may look something like this: Invalid token &quot; found on line 2 at column 62. The invalid token is a hint. Also try just using your IDE. CFEclipse's synax checker isn't perfect, but many times it does flag a syntax error and I just don't notice it.</p>
</li>
</ol>
