<p>I just wanted to write a quick note to make sure folks know about the passing of one our communities best speakers, Glenda Vigoreaux. Charlie Arehart has written up the details so I'm going to link to him:</p>

<p>I've met and worked with Glenda and this is truly a loss to our community. She was very intelligent and had a wonderful personality that really came out in her training and presentations.</p>
<p>p.s. Sorry for the lack of posting lately. I've been in meeting for the last two days (I've got meetings scheduled all weekend). More details on why later.</p>
