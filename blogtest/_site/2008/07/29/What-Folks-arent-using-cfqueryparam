<p>It seems that while I was gone there was some noise about CF and SQL Injection. I find this a bit surprising as I thought <i>everyone</i> was using cfqueryparam now, aren't they? In all seriousness, here are some few links to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.codersrevolution.com/index.cfm/2008/7/24/Announcing-the-first-ever-International-Operation-cfSQLprotect">Announcing the first ever International Operation cf_SQLprotect</a>: I'm a few days late on this (let's see - Friday at this time I was downtown Austin), but Brad Wood decided that July 25th would be a good day to scan your code for sql vulnerabilities. While we should do this <b>constantly</b>, there is nothing wrong with doing it again, over your entire code base.
<li>Brad linked to <a href="http://qpscanner.riaforge.org/">QueryParam Scanner</a> by Peter Boughton.
<li>Brad also linked to Daryl Banttari's <a href="http://www.webapper.net/index.cfm/2008/7/22/ColdFusion-SQL-Injection">scanner</a>.
</ul>
<p>Now all we need is a one stop var scope checker/queryparam checker in one tool.</p>
