<p>If you are a fan of the AIR based client to Google Analytics (and let's face it, why wouldn't you be, it makes GA a heck of a lot easier to use than Google's own site), you will be happy to know that Nicolas has released an update that fixes the recent login issues. You can get the latest version <a href="http://www.aboutnico.be/index.php/2008/07/31/google-analytics-air-back-up/">here</a>.</p>
<p>And I'm ashamed to say it - but I forgot to blog it when Nicolas joined us at <a href="http://www.broadchoice.com">Broadchoice</a> a few weeks back. The New Jedi Order is forming...</p>
