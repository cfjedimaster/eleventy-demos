<p>I've been working with a user on this issue and since it involves CSS and IE (two things I try not to be familiar with), I figured I'd blog it to see if one of my readers can help.</p>
<p>Here is the gist of the problem. The user has a cfgrid, ajax-based (well, the new fancy HTML grid, in this demo it won't use HTTP to load it's data), that is editable. In IE something odd happens.</p>
<p>When you click and edit a cell, the cell goes blank. But if you click on another row, you can see your data. If you click back, and try to type, your data <i>is</i> there, so you don't lose anything. When you submit, the mods are there as well.</p>
<p>Here are some screen shots. First, the table before anything is done:</p>

<p>Now here it is, blank, right after I finished modifying it:</p>

<p>And here is a shot with me selecting another row. You can see now that the data is there:</p>

<p>My guess is that this has to be a simple CSS/IE conflict. Anyone else run into it? Anyone have a possible solution?</p>
