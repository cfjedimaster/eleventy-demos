<h1>Post</h1>

<p>Just a quick note to let folks know that I'll also be blogging over at the new <a href="http://www.broadchoice.com">Broadchoice</a> blog, <a href="http://blog.broadchoice.com">ArgumentCollection</a>. I'll be joined by Sean, Joe, Brian, and Nicolas. The idea is that our Broadchoice focused entries will be posted there. Already there are some good entries there (Check out Joe's entries on Groovy) so check it out!</p>
