<h1>Post</h1>

<p>I've updated my <a href="http://googlecal.riaforge.org/">GoogleCal</a> project. I finally have a (slightly) better understanding of Google's API (which I still say is way more complex than it needs to be!) and it lead to a much slimmer CFC and a simpler API. For folks who are using this now, you <b>must</b> read the docs first as the API to the CFC has been changed. I've also added support for deleting events. Editing events shouldn't be too hard so I'll try to get that in soon.</p>
