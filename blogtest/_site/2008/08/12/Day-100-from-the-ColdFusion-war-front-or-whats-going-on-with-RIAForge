<p>I've blogged quite a bit lately about the issues I've been having with RIAForge. A few days back I decided to take another tact and put <a href="http://www.fusion-reactor.com/fr">Fusion-Reactor</a> on the box. I've told folks before that FR is pretty darn impressive, but I was surprised at how quickly it exposed issues on the server, specifically at the database level.</p>
<p>My primary sin? Lack of indexes. I enabled the JDBC wrapper for the main database connection and immediately began to see queries that were taking a lot longer than I thought they should. I began adding indexes where appropriate and it's helped quite a bit, but I still have more work to do.</p>
<p>Another interesting thing FR fleshed out was a rather slow XML process. I had removed this some time ago, but I only 'removed' it by switching to JSON. The old event was still there, and picked up by search engines. How often do folks comb through their Model-Glue XML files to ensure they don't have abandoned events?</p>
<p>So where do we stand now? The server still has issues. Both yesterday and today I found Apache crashed and burned. Well, I should say not responding. It was running in the services panel but not responding to requests. A quick restart of Apache brought the site back up. I've done some modifications to the logging to try to flesh out more about what could be harming it.</p>
<p>I'm also still seeing the Subversion processes as being a pain point. I mentioned before I had worked on a new Subversion wrapper, but encountered a few issues when it went to production. I'm going to try to get that wrapped this month some time. I also have search engines running the Zip action. I need to remember to use those nofollow/noindex tags for links I don't want picked up. I also should consider caching the zipped files.</p>
<p>One quick note - if you plan to use CF8, FR, and MySQL, and employ the JDBC wrapper, be sure to read this <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/fusionreactor/browse_thread/thread/214430b00c23eb8c/86ded4670b759221?lnk=gst&q=mysql+jdbc+wrapper#86ded4670b759221">thread</a> from the FR support group.</p>
<p>Lastly, I want to thank Intergral for providing a license to let me keep running FR on the <a href="http://www.riaforge.org">RIAForge</a> box!</p>
