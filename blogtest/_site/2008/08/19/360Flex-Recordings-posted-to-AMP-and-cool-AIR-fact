<p>Ted pinged me earlier today to let me know that the first 5 sessions from 360|Flex are available via AMP (Adobe Media Player). You can find more information at his blog post:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.onflex.org/ted/2008/08/recording-360flex-free-full-sessions-on.php">Recording 360|Flex - Free Full Sessions on AMP</a></p>
<p>You can actually install AMP via the badge on the blog entry. Not only will this install AMP, it will also auto-add the 360|Flex subscription. I didn't know AIR installers could do that. I knew they could handle installing AIR if need be, and of course your application, but being able to tweak settings as well is rather nice.</p>
<p>Be sure to click the badge in the middle of his blog entry. When I clicked the badge on the right, it did not add the content, and no amount of searching would turn the content up.</p>
<p>I've got to say - I have not been a big fan of AMP. I find it clunky and slow, and it just hasn't worked well for me on my Mac. I will say though that content like this is enough to make me get over it though. Then again, the content could have just as easily been pushed to Connect probably.</p>
