<p>This is from NOAA's <a href="http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/refresh/graphics_at2+shtml/203214.shtml?hwind120?large#contents">hurricane strength prediction chart</a> for Gustav. I've got a feeling it will continue to pull to the right. I was pretty impressed by the data services at NOAA, especially the use of RSS feeds. I just wish there was a feed/API to get the long/lat of Gustav currently. In theory you could look for:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
THE CENTER OF TROPICAL STORM GUSTAV WAS
LOCATED NEAR LATITUDE 19.1 NORTH...LONGITUDE 74.4 WEST OR 90
MILES...150 KM...SOUTHEAST OF GUANTANAMO CUBA
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>in the most recent RSS item and parse it out there. I think I may whip up a quick howcloseisraytodeath() method tonight to see how accurately it can track the distance. Of course, I've got a nice Flip video recorder now so I have no excuse to avoid filming the fun this time.</p>
