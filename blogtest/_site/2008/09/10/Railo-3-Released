<p>I've blogged about Railo before, a free ColdFusion engine. Yesterday they released the final version of Railo 3. Details about what is new may be found <a href="http://www.railo-technologies.com/en/index.cfm?treeID=353">here</a> and you can download the server <a href="http://www.railo-technologies.com/en/index.cfm?treeID=224">here</a>. See their site for more information, and details on how the free edition differs from the paid versions.</p>
