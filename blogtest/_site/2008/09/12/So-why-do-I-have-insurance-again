<p>Allstate just came out to process my claims. The house damage (so far) was just around 750 bucks. The roof damage will probably be less than 500. The food loss (with medicine) was pretty high, probably around 1k. I wasn't sure how much I'd get, but I was hoping for something.</p>
<p>Turns out that was a pipe dream. According to the guy who came out (I'm calling my local rep Monday), LA passed a law saying that the deductible for hurricane damage is 5% of your house value, which means I'm not even close to being able to get a cent back. I guess I should be happy my loss wasn't so bad, but geeze, I'd like to know I get something for my coverage!</p>
<p>&lt;/rant&gt;</p>
