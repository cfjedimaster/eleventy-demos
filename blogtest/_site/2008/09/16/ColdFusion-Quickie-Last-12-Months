<p>
I'm really bad with programming so finding it very stressful at work. Could you please help me with something? I need to create a strings of months to do some stats and what I need is the previous 12 months. For example if current month is Sept then I need a loop to get all months from Sept last year to Aug this year. I've been scratching my head but couldnt work out a loop to do this. Please help me with this. I really appreciate your help. Thank you very much.

<p>This is really simple (hence the quickie title) once you use ColdFusion's <a href="http://www.cfquickdocs.com/cf8/?getDoc=DateAdd">dateAdd</a> function. As you can probably guess, it lets you take a date and then add an arbitrary amount of time to it. We can use this to add (or in our case, substract) from the current month. Here is a simple example:</p>
<more>
<code>
&lt;cfloop from="12" to="1" index="x" step="-1"&gt;
	&lt;cfset theMonth = dateAdd("m", -1 * x, now())&gt;
	&lt;cfoutput&gt;#dateFormat(theMonth,"mmmm yyyy")#&lt;br&gt;&lt;/cfoutput&gt;
&lt;/cfloop&gt;
</code>
<p>I looped from 12 to 1, and for each value, simply &quot;added&quot; it by using the negative value. The dateFormat was completely arbitrary. You can output the value anyway you want.</p>
<p>And a quick personal note to &quot;a reader&quot; (I didn't put her name in as it was rather unique), I feel your pain. If it makes you feel any better, I'm going through it <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2008/8/16/Pardon-me-while-I-have-a-brain-cramp-or-three">as well</a>, but it does get better with practice!</p>
