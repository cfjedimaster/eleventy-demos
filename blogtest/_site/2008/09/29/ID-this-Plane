<p>Ok, so a bit OT, but I saw something incredibly cool today. While waiting at a neighbor's house I heard an odd sounding plane approaching. When it finally came into view, I saw a white plane, commuter style, about the size of a Lear. It was a prop, but the engines were reversed. The nose had a wide white small wing on it. I've seen this plane before on the net, but had never seen it in real life. Unfortunately I have no idea what the name is. Anyone know? The design was pretty cool, but the engine sound really intrigued me. It sounded much deeper than a normal prop.</p>
