<p><a href="http://spoolmail.riaforge.org/">SpoolMail</a> was updated to 1.5 today. It includes a mod by Lucas Sherwood to display the ReplyTo property and a mod by Dharmesh Goel to allow for simple editing of emails and the ability to resend from the message. (There was already a button on the top to move a bunch of mails back to the queue so this just duplicates that functionality for a specific message.) I'm curious about what folks think about the Edit ability. Personally I never use SpoolMail on production, but do others use it there?</p>
<p>Next, Nathan pinged me to let me know that <a href="http://coldfire.riaforge.org">ColdFire</a> 1.2.95.95 was released. This is a bug fix update only.</p>
