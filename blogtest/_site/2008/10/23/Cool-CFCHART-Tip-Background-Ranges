<p>The following tip comes from reader Rick Drew. He both asked, and solved this, himself, which makes my job a heck of a lot easier! His question was - how do I create a background 'range' on a chart that can be used to compare against data. In other words, imagine a line chart ranging from 1 to 100. Now imagine that these were golf scores and that the desired score (golfers forgive me, I'm making this up) was 50-70. He wanted to plot a background on the graph for that range so it was really clear to see how the scores compared to the desired value.</p>

<p>Rick found his answer in the chart editor, and in custom XML, which is something I've blogged about numerous times before. Any time you have a question about charts and you can't find the solution in the ColdFusion docs, just pop open the editor and start digging.</p>
<p>
Rick found that the limits tag can be used to create a range. Here is a sample:
<p>
<code>
&lt;frameChart isInterpolated="false" is3d="false"&gt;
	&lt;yAxis&gt;
   &lt;limits index="0" min="120" max="140" color="#e6e7e8"/&gt;
	&lt;/yAxis&gt;
&lt;/frameChart&gt;
</code>
<p>
(Note this XML also turns off interpolation and 3d effects which isn't required for what we are doing.) The limits tag is placed with the yAxis tag. I picked my min and max random based on the data I have for my sample and the color is a gray that matches the rest of the chart. This produces a chart like the one below:

Neat trick! I've included a complete script below for folks to play with.
<p>
<code>
&lt;cfset q = queryNew("dept,year,sales","varchar,integer,integer")&gt;
&lt;!--- generate random sales data ---&gt;
&lt;cfloop index="y" from="1990" to="1998"&gt;
	&lt;cfscript&gt;
	queryAddRow(q);
	if(y neq 1996) {
	querySetCell(q, "dept", "Gamma");
	querySetCell(q, "year", y);
	querySetCell(q, "sales", randRange(80,220));
	} else {
	querySetCell(q, "dept", "Gamma");
	querySetCell(q, "year", y);
	}
	&lt;/cfscript&gt;
&lt;/cfloop&gt;
&lt;cfdump var="#q#"&gt;
<p>&lt;!--- style from webcharts ---&gt;
&lt;cfsavecontent variable=&quot;style&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;frameChart isInterpolated=&quot;false&quot; is3d=&quot;false&quot;&gt;
&lt;yAxis&gt;
&lt;limits index=&quot;0&quot; min=&quot;120&quot; max=&quot;140&quot; color=&quot;#e6e7e8&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/yAxis&gt;
&lt;/frameChart&gt;
&lt;/cfsavecontent&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;cfchart chartWidth=&quot;400&quot; chartHeight=&quot;400&quot; title=&quot;Sales&quot; style=&quot;#style#&quot;&gt;
&lt;cfchartseries type=&quot;line&quot; query=&quot;q&quot; itemColumn=&quot;year&quot; valueColumn=&quot;sales&quot; /&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;/cfchart&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;cfchart chartWidth=&quot;400&quot; chartHeight=&quot;400&quot; title=&quot;Sales&quot;&gt;
&lt;cfchartseries type=&quot;line&quot; query=&quot;q&quot; itemColumn=&quot;year&quot; valueColumn=&quot;sales&quot; /&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;/cfchart&gt;
