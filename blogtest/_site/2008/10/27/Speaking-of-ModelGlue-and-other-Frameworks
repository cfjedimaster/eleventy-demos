<p>Just a quick note to suggest folks get the latest <a href="http://www.cfconversations.com/">podcast from CFConversations</a>. I participated in a lively frameworks debate with Brian Meloche, Adam Haskell, Chris Peters, Mark Mandel, and Nick Kwiatkowski. It was a pretty fun conversation and I think it might of interest to my readers. You can find a direct link to the mp3 <a href="http://www.cfconversations.com/enclosures/CFConversations020%2Emp3">here</a> and be sure to check the earlier debate on <a href="http://www.cfconversations.com/index.cfm/2008/10/19/CFConversations-19-Roundtable-6-Controller-based-Frameworks-Part-1">controller frameworks</a>.</p>
