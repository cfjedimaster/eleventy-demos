<p>MTV launched a new music video service, <a href="http://www.mtvmusic.com/">MTV Music</a>. The UI is rather nice. Maybe it's the old man in me but I love the large, super obvious search box. They also allow for embedding...</p>

<p>What surprised me though was the lack of depth. I mean I was kind of pushing it with some non-popular choices (Control Machete, Chapterhouse, Shelby), but this is MTV! They should have something like 2 trillion videos in their vault. They had all the 'expected' alternative videos (Cure, Depeche Mode, etc), but anything a bit too far out there was absent. Shoot, they didn't even have Siouxsie, and any music site without the Banshees is sorely lacking. I can certainly find everything at YouTube.</p>
<p>Anyway, my excuse to bring this up was to point out that they have a nice API: <a href="http://developer.mtvnservices.com/">MTVN Content API</a>. Let's see who can get the first CFC wrapper done.</p>
<p>Hey - maybe if this Internet thing works for em, they could try it on TV as well. Imagine it - a whole TV station that did nothing but play videos. Nah, that wouldn't work.</p>
