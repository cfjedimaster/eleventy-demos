<p><a href="http://max.adobe.com/na/sessions/browser/#861">Object-Relational Mapping in ColdFusion 9</a></p>
<p>His session is at the same time as mine, so I bugged him for a sneak peak. It absolutely slick. The bees knees. Like peanut butter <b>and</b> jelly. Definitely check it out if you are attending MAX.</p>
