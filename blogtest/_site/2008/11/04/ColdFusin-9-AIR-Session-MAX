<p>Rakshith of Adobe sent me a note about the updated session description for his class at MAX: <a href="http://max.adobe.com/na/sessions/browser/#572">ColdFusion Powered AIR</a></p>
<p>While I think most of us have a good appreciation for how ColdFusion can serve the data/server side needs of an AIR application, I'm very curious to see what Adobe has planned on top of this. From Rakshith's <a href="http://www.rakshith.net/blog/?p=60">blog entry</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
What is it going to be?
</p>
<p>
One of the feature in Centaur will ease building offline applications in AIR.

<p>Sounds intriguing!</p>
