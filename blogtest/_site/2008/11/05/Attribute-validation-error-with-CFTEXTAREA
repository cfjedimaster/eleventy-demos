<p>Here is an interesting little issue a reader ran into this week. Can you tell me why the following code throws an error?</p>
<code>
&lt;cfform name="foo"&gt;
&lt;cftextarea name="comments" value="Congrats Obama!"&gt;
&lt;/cftextarea&gt;
&lt;/cfform&gt;
</code>

The error that is thrown is:
<blockquote>
<p>
Attribute validation error for the CFTEXTAREA tag.
<br/><br/>
The value of the VALUE attribute cannot be defined twice. ''
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seems rather odd, doesn't it? There is clearly only one value attribute above. But the reader forgot that <i>normally</i>, the value of a textarea is defined between the beginning and end tag, like so:</p>
<code>
&lt;cftextarea name="comments"&gt;
Congrats Obamas!
&lt;/cftextarea&gt;
</code>
<p>Because his code had a line break between the start and end tag, ColdFusion considered that white space to be a value, and threw an error. Personally I think ColdFusion could just do a quick trim() check if it has an value attribute, but the fix is easy enough. You can move the value between the tags as I have before. Or you can remove the line break:</p>
<code>
&lt;cftextarea name="comments" value="Congrats Obama!"&gt;&lt;/cftextarea&gt;
</code>
<p>And lastly, you can just use a shorthand notation for the closing tag:</p>
<code>
&lt;cftextarea name="comments" value="Congrats Obama!" /&gt;
</code>}
