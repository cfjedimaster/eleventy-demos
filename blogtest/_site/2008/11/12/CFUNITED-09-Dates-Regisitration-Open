<p>The title pretty much says it all, but the dates and <a href="http://register.cfunited.com/">registration form</a> for CFUNITED 09 is now open.</p>
<p>The dates are: August 12-15 (with a pre-conference class on the 11th).</p>
<p>The location is: Lansdowne Resort, Leesburg, VA. See the <a href="http://cfunited.com/go/travel">travel page</a> for more information.</p>
<p>Prices are $849 for the 4 day package and $699 for the 3 day package. There is also a Saturday package for $399.</p>
<p>It looks like the <a href="http://cfunited.com/">main site</a> hasn't bee updated quite yet, but as I just bugged Liz on IM, I'm sure it won't be more than a few minutes.</p>
