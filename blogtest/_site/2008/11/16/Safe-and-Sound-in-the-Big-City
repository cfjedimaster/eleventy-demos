<p>Woot. I got here - safe - and on time. Well, two minutes late, but believe me, I'm not going to complain about a few minutes. I love San Francisco, but I swear in all the years I've been here, this is the warmest I've felt it. So much for all the warm clothes and jacket.</p>
<p>I guess I shouldn't be surprised - but I saw two video game billboards down town (Left for Dead and GTA). Cool!</p>
<p>I'm sitting in CFUNDERGROUND now listening (ok, half listening, half blogging) to Joe give his presentation. I hope to see everyone (yes, everyone) soon!</p>
