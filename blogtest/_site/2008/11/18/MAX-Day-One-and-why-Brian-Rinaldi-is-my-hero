<h1>Post</h1>

<p>Good morning everyone. I wanted to post a Day One summary last night, but unfortunately I was diverted by Anchor Steam until about 1 in the morning.</p>
<p>Outside of the keynote, which I <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2008/11/17/MAX-Keynote-Liveblog">blogged</a> about yesterday, my entire day was spent at the ColdFusion Unconference. So far it's been great, and I hope people are enjoying it. It feels like an all day user group meeting and the topics and discussions have been great. The biggest hitch was that I misunderstood the food situation. Luckily I wasn't strung up for it, and Brian came to my rescue with a plate of food. (But let's be honest, most developers can probably miss a meal or two. ;)</p>
<p>I want to give a big thank you to the speakers from day 1: Charlie Arehart, Brian Rinaldi, Kevin Hoyt, Mark Kruger, Joshua Cyr, and Brian Meloche.</p>
<p>I'll be blogging from the second keynote later this morning. Supposedly we have some ColdFusion goodies coming out way!</p>
<p>p.s. I mentioned that <a href="http://www.mikerelm.com/">Mike Relm</a> opened the keynote yesterday. I was lucky enough to get a chance to meet him personally later on and yes - I gushed like a fan boy. I walked away with a signed CD and DVD. Woot!</p>
