<p>This has been mentioned already, but I wanted to make sure it got as much coverage as possible. I didn't realize this till MAX, but if you download the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/go/cfevangelismkit">ColdFusion Evangelism Kit</a> (thanks to <a href="http://www.webbschofield.com/">Kristen Scholfield</a>) you see mention not only of ColdFusion 9, but ColdFusion 10 (code named Sully and planned for 2010) and ColdFusion 11 (code named Link and planned for 2011) as well.</p>
<p>Not much to say here, but it is <b>really</b> nice to see such extended planning for the best web application platform available.</p>
