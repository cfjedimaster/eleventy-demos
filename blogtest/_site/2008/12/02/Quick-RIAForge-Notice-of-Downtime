<p>After a few days of good behavior, <a href="http://www.riaforge.org">RIAForge</a> decided to go all Lohan on me and crash three times in one day. I'm going to be updating the web server configuration to run the SVN stuff in a separate Windows service. I'm not 100% convinced it is the issue, but I'd like to separate it out and see if that isolates the issue. Expect RIAForge to be up/down over the next 30 minutes or so.</p>
