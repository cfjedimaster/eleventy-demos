<p>A friend, who prefers to remain anonymous, pinged me today to ask what my favorite cfqueryparam scanner was. I don't actually use one, but when I asked him why he wanted one, I was a bit surprised by his answer.</p>
<p>My friend does hosting, but it's not his primary business. He has decided that he is going to begin a policy of scanning all the files on his system for ColdFusion queries w/o cfqueryparam.  He will then send emails out to all developers who have failed to properly use cfqueryparam. If the code isn't updated in two weeks, the server will be disconnected.</p>
<p>What do people think about this? Too draconian? Should a host be scanning for 'trouble' code at all?</p>
