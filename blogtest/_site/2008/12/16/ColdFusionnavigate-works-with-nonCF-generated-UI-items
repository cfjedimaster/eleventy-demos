<p><a href="http://www.boyzoid.com">Scott</a> just pinged me with an interesting question - can you use ColdFusion.navigate with a &quot;normal&quot; div or does it only work with items generated by ColdFusion 8 (cfdiv, cfwindow, cfpod, etc)? We both tested and discovered that - yes - you certainly can use it with a &quot;vanilla&quot; div - but you must get ColdFusion to preload the proper JavaScript files. Consider this simple demo:</p>
<code>
&lt;cfajaximport  /&gt;
<p>&lt;script&gt;
function doit() {
ColdFusion.navigate('test3.cfm','booger')
}
&lt;/script&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;a href=&quot;javaScript:doit()&quot;&gt;load the booger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;booger&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></p>
<p>Starting from the bottom up - the div, booger, is our container. I have a test link above it that runs the doit function. doit() then simply uses ColdFusion.navigate. If you just use that portion of the file, though, you will get a client-side JavaScript error saying that ColdFusion doesn't exist. You need to tell ColdFusion to load the the Ajax libraries. This can be done with a simple, empty cfajaximport tag.</p>
<p>Not sure how useful this is, but if you don't have Spry or jQuery loaded and need a simple and fast way to load data via Ajax, this would work well.</p>
