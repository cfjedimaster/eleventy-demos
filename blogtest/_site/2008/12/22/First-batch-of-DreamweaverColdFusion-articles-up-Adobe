<p>So none of the articles will probably interest readers here, but the first batch of my article updates for Dreamweaver CS4 and ColdFusion are up at Adobe...</p>

<p>Here is a direct link: <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/dreamweaver/application_development.html#coldfusion">http://www.adobe.com/devnet/dreamweaver/application_development.html#coldfusion</a></p>
<p>Again, nothing too exciting here for most of my readers I would assume, but I hope they can help ColdFusion newbies using Dreamweaver get into the product quicker and easier (that's what - never mind).</p>
<p>I can say that I've enjoyed using Dreamweaver lately. I don't think it is as good as Eclipse... when Eclipse runs right, and I can certainly say I won't be bad mouthing it anymore, so thank you to Adobe for opening my eyes a bit.</p>
<p>Hey, that could be a cool new slogan:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Dreamweaver - It doesn't suck!
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And this is why I don't do marketing.</p>
