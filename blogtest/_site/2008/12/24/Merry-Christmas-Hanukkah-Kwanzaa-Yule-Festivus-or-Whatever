<p>Just a quick note to wish those of you celebrating the holidays (no matter what the holiday is), a great, fun, and of course, safe time. I wrapped up my shopping Monday night (well, technically I got one more gift via Amazon on Wednesday, sorry buddy, its going to be late) and now it's time to just relax and enjoy the time off.</p>
