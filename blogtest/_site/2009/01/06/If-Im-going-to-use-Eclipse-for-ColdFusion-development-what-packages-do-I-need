<p>This question just came into my mailbox and I see it enough on cf-talk and other listservs so I figured it warranted a quick blog post. If you are <i>just</i> concerned about doing ColdFusion development with Eclipse, then you want to grab:</p>
<p><a href="www.cfeclipse.org">CFEclipse</a> - This is the main package for doing CF development with Eclipse. It will give you syntax highlighting, CFC method views, tag completion, etc.</p>
<p><a href="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/coldfusion/8/eclipseextensions/CF801-Extensions-for-Eclipse.zip">Adobe CF Extensions</a> - This gives you RDS support as well as query building/exploring (you can view your tables and write simple queries as well as testing them). It also gives you the sexy log viewer. This tool lets you watch a log file and as messages are appended, they automatically show up in the viewer. You also get the debugger and snazzy wizards.</p>
<p><a href="http://livedocs.adobe.com/coldfusion/8/com.adobe.coldfusion_help_8_1.0.1.jar">Adobe CF Help for Eclipse</a> - The ColdFusion docs for Eclipse</p>
<p>There are certainly other packages a good developer will want, but these will get you going with ColdFusion.</p>
