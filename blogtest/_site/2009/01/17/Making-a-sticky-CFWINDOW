<p>Ok, I'm not <i>really</i> a huge fan of CFWINDOW, despite this being the <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2009/1/16/Launching-CFWINDOW-with-a-Dynamic-Location">second blog post</a> in a row about them. That being said, I thought I'd recreate a trick (see PS below) with CFWINDOW that maybe some folks will find useful. The trick involves keeping CFWINDOW in a position and making it stick there as you scroll. It is probably best if you see it live:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.coldfusionjedi.com/demos/stalker/wintest.cfm">http://www.coldfusionjedi.com/demos/stalker/wintest.cfm</a></p>
<p>Scroll down and note the CFWINDOW will adjust itself back to the original position. The code simply uses JavaScript to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Notice scrolls
<li>When they scroll, note the position of the scroll and start an interval
<li>Figure out how far 'off' the CFWINDOW is from where it should be and go 90% of the way there.
<li>If the distance is less than some threshold, just set it and stop the interval
</ul>
<p>A bit silly, but fun! The complete code is here:</p>
<code>
&lt;cfajaximport tags="cfwindow" /&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
<p>&lt;head&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
var origx = 50;
var origy = 50;
var origheight = 200;
var targety = &quot;&quot;;
var moving = false;</p>
<p>function init() {
ColdFusion.Window.create('mywin','Windows Rules','win.cfm',{x:origx,y:origy,width:200,height:origheight,draggable:false});
window.onscroll = handleScroll;
}</p>
<p>function handleScroll(e) {
var cury = window.scrollY;
var win = ColdFusion.Window.getWindowObject('mywin');
//var newy = origy+curY;
//console.log('set y to '+newy)
//win.moveTo(origx,newy);
targety = origy+cury;
if (!moving) {
moving = true;
heartbeat = window.setInterval('moveit()', 10);
}
}</p>
<p>function moveit() {</p>
<pre><code>var win = ColdFusion.Window.getWindowObject('mywin');
var pos = win.xy;
//find out how far I'm away from target
//console.log('my targety is '+targety+' and my current y is '+pos[1])
var distance = targety - pos[1];
	
if (distance == 0) {
	window.clearInterval(heartbeat);
	moving = false;
	return;
}

//we want to go X%, unless the X% is &amp;lt; threshhold of &amp;, then just go there
if(distance &amp;gt; 3 || distance &amp;lt; -3) var tomove = Math.round(0.09 * distance);
else var tomove = distance;
var newy = pos[1]+tomove;
//console.log('my newy is '+newy)
win.moveTo(origx,newy);
</code></pre>
<p>}
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;body&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Header&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;cfoutput&gt;#repeatString(&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;,200)#&lt;/cfoutput&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Footer&lt;/h2&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;cfset ajaxOnLoad(&quot;init&quot;)&gt;
</code></p>
<p>p.s. Ok, so this effect has been done before, and probably with better JavaScript, but I think, stress <i>think</i> I was the first one to do it. Way back in the old days, around 96 or so, the company I worked for did a lot of custom web development for Netscape. One day we were tasked to do a company timeline for them. The timeline was a very wide graph inside a frame. The timeline tracked 3 things I think, and they wanted a little control you could click to turn on/off the lines. The problem was that as you scrolled along the timeline, you lost the little control doohicky.</p>
<p>I created what I called the Stalker, a bit of JS code that simply did, well, what I described above. I was pretty surprised when it actually worked. Later on I wrote an IE compatible version and eventually wrapped it into a custom tag for the Allaire ColdFusion tag gallery. Unfortunately the company I worked for back then wasn't really into the OS thing so the tag was encrypted and it belonged to them. Anyway, not trying to brag (ok, maybe I am) but I thought it was an interesting story.</p>
<p>Ok, another quick side story to this side story. I did some Perl work at Netscape and would, from time to time, check their intranet. They had a stats page for netscape.com. If I remember right the #s were insane, something like millions and millions of hits per day - all from folks who didn't know how to change their homepage. The Perl project is a story for another day.</p>
