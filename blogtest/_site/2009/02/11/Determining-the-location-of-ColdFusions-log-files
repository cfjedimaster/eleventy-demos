<p>This was asked on cf-talk yesterday but figured it would be a good tip to share here. Is there a way - via code - to determine the location of ColdFusion log files? Yes, via the Admin API:</p>
<code>
&lt;cfscript&gt;
adminObj = createObject("component","cfide.adminapi.administrator");
adminObj.login("admin");
<p>debugger = createObject(&quot;component&quot;, &quot;cfide.adminapi.debugging&quot;);
logfolder = debugger.getLogProperty(&quot;logdirectory&quot;);
&lt;/cfscript&gt;
&lt;cfoutput&gt;#logfolder#&lt;/cfoutput&gt;
</code></p>
<p>The first two lines create an instance of the Administrator API CFC and logs in with my password. (And no, 'admin' isn't really my password. It's password.)</p>
<p>The next two lines use the debugging CFC to run getLogProperty(&quot;logdirectory&quot;), which as you can guess, gets the log directory value.</p>
