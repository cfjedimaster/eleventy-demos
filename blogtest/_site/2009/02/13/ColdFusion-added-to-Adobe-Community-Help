<p>I twittered on this earlier (for folks who want to follow me, I'm <a href="http://twitter.com/cfjedimaster">cfjedimaster</a> on Twitter) - Adobe has added ColdFusion to their Community Help system. Head over to the <a href="http://community.adobe.com/help/search.html?lbl=coldfusion_product_adobelr">form</a> and try a search for RSS. Notice how my blog comes up? You can now search at Adobe and get a mix of 'official' and community resources. More information may be found at the Adobe Community Help blog:</p>
