<p>A reader on <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2008/9/10/Ask-a-Jedi-Dynamically-updating-line-items-on-a-form#c66689663-19B9-E658-9D8C331055BBD5D8">another post</a> asked me about using jQuery to dynamically add form fields to an existing form. I whipped up a quick demo that I'd like to get folks opinions on. Here is what I came up with:</p>

<code>
&lt;cfif not structIsEmpty(form)&gt;
	&lt;cfdump var="#form#"&gt;
&lt;/cfif&gt;
<p>&lt;html&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;head&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;/jquery/jquery.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
var current = 1;</p>
<p>function addPerson() {
console.log('running addPerson')
//current keeps track of how many people we have.
current++;
var strToAdd = '&lt;p&gt;&lt;label for=&quot;firstname&quot;'+current+'&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/label&gt; &lt;em&gt;<em>&lt;/em&gt;&lt;input id=&quot;firstname'+current+'&quot; name=&quot;firstname'+current+'&quot; size=&quot;25&quot; /&gt; &lt;input id=&quot;lastname'+current+'&quot; name=&quot;lastname'+current+'&quot; size=&quot;25&quot; /&gt;'
strToAdd += '&lt;p&gt;&lt;label for=&quot;email'+current+'&quot;&gt;Email&lt;/label&gt;	&lt;em&gt;</em>&lt;/em&gt;&lt;input id=&quot;email'+current+'&quot; name=&quot;email'+current+'&quot; size=&quot;25&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;'
console.log(strToAdd)
$('#mainField').append(strToAdd)
}</p>
<p>$(document).ready(function(){
$('#addPerson').click(addPerson)
});
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;body&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;form id=&quot;someform&quot; method=&quot;post&quot;&gt;
&lt;fieldset id=&quot;mainField&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;label for=&quot;firstname1&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;em&gt;<em>&lt;/em&gt;&lt;input id=&quot;firstname1&quot; name=&quot;firstname1&quot; size=&quot;25&quot; /&gt; &lt;input id=&quot;lastname1&quot; name=&quot;lastname1&quot; size=&quot;25&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;label for=&quot;email1&quot;&gt;Email&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;em&gt;</em>&lt;/em&gt;&lt;input id=&quot;email1&quot; name=&quot;email1&quot; size=&quot;25&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/fieldset&gt;</p>
<pre><code>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;input type=&quot;button&quot; id=&quot;addPerson&quot; value=&quot;Add Another Person&quot;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Save&quot;&amp;gt;
</code></pre>
<p>&lt;/form&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></p>
<p>I want to talk about this from the bottom up, so please read 'up' with me. The form contains one block of detail for a person - a firstname, lastname, and email address. There are two buttons - one to add another person and one to submit. This is what I started off with as the base form. I wanted it so that when you clicked Add Another Person, it would essentially duplicate the 3 fields.</p>
<p>I began by telling jQuery to monitor the click event for the button (inobtrusive JS FTW):</p>
<code>
$(document).ready(function(){
	$('#addPerson').click(addPerson)
});
</code>
<p>addPerson then had to do two things. First, it needed to know how many people existed on the page already. I had created a JavaScript variable, 'current', with a hard coded value of 1. This doesn't need to be hard coded, but it certainly seemed to be the simplest way to handle it. Inside of addPerson, I immediately increase the value by one. I generate the HTML I want to use which was basically a cut and paste of the HTML below. The only difference is that I make the number part dynamic. I could have probably used a special character like $N and then used Regex to replace it. (On second though, that would have been a lot cleaner I think.) Then I just append the new string to the HTML.</p>

<p>So a few open questions/things to discuss:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>jQuery provides a clone() function for the DOM. In theory, I could have just cloned my fieldset. The problem with that (as far as I know) is that I'd end up with form fields that have the same name. That &quot;works&quot; in CF, but the values would be a list. So for example, form.firstname would be &quot;Ray,Jay&quot;. That works well until someone has a comma in their name. Not very likely, but still. I believe in PHP it actually gives you the values in an array, but in CF we have no control over that. Maybe I could have done a clone, gotten the new node, and did the regex on the HTML?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I didn't demonstrate the CF side to parse this because I've done so many times before, but in case folks are curious - you would simply introspect the Form struct to figure out how many people you have to process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Of course, the next step is to add validation. I'm willing to bet I can use the kick butt jQuery Validation plugin with dynamic forms. I'll check that next!</p>
</li>
</ol>
