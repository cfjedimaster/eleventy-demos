<p>Just a quick note to let folks know I'll be out of the office today (and not doing any <i>real</i> blogging) to celebrate Mardi Gras. I'm about to head down town with the kids to the first parade. For folks sending me technical questions via email - expect a slight delay this week in my response time. I'll post a picture of two to Twitter (www.twitter.com/cfjedimaster) as well.</p>
