<p>I don't really <i>read</i> RSS feeds with Firefox, I just view them in order to get information for adding feeds to my aggregator, but I've wondered if anyone else has ever noticed this?</p>
<p>p.s. Maybe I should just shut up and be happy that Firefox 3 isn't slow as molasses like Firefox 2 was under OSX!</p>
