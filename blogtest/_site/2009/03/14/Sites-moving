<h1>Post</h1>

<p>Just a quick note. I'm in the process of moving sites from this box. I've already moved a few (like my local <a href="http://www.acadiana-aug.org">user group</a>) of the smaller sites, but the bigger (more popular I should say) ones will begin soon. I just migrated <a href="http://www.coldfusionbloggers.org">ColdFusionBloggers</a> and I'll be doing CFLib and this blog a bit later in the next few days. If a site refuses to come up, just give it an hour. If you see anything weird post next Friday though, please let me know asap.</p>
<p>And let me just say. I fricken hate Vista/IIS7. XP looks golden compared to it. Ugh. :)</p>
