<h1>Post</h1>

<p>Ok, a big thanks goes out to <a href="http://www.boyzoid.com">Scott Stroz</a> for this one. I've been using Eclipse for a while now but never needed to do a multi-file search and replace until last week. Turns out it is rather simple, but I had never really noticed the feature before. I figure a quick blog post may help others, and since I know I'll probably forget in six months, it will help me as well.</p>

<p>First, select the root folder in Navigator:</p>

<p>Second, go to Search/File in the navigation menu.</p>

<p>Enter your text in &quot;Containing text&quot; (I entered UDF). Note the Scope. <b>This is critical.</b> It should have &quot;Selected resources&quot; picked. If it is disabled, it means you didn't click in the Navigator first. This bugs/confuses the heck out of me. If you do 2 multi-file search and replaces, it is easy to forget to click back here. It is like Eclipse 'forgets' you had chosen a folder before.</p>
<p>Now, instead of hitting Search, click the Replace... button. Obvious, I know, but I swear I had never noticed it before.</p>
<p>Eclipse will now automatically run the search. You will be given a list of results, and the chance to enter your replacement term.</p>

<p>Just type in the term and hit Replace or Replace All.</p>
<p>So far this has worked perfectly for me. I did screw up one time and forgot to change the value on the &quot;With&quot; field, but that was entirely user error, and not Eclipse's fault. Also don't forget what I said about clicking back in the Navigator before you do the search.</p>
