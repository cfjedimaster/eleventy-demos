<p>Earlier today Kristen Schofield <a href="http://www.webbschofield.com/index.cfm/2009/3/18/Free-ColdFusion-Curriculum-Now-Available-from-Adobe">posted</a> about a new curriculum available for learning ColdFusion. The curriculum consists of two PDFs (not sure if code is included, didn't see it) and the coverage appears to be quite intensive. I'm a bit puzzled by some of the choices in regard to what is considered advanced (lists are advanced?) but there is a <b>large</b> amount of material here - and all <b>100%</b> free. You can go directly to the materials here:</p>

<p>To be clear, this is <b>not</b> just for students. Anyone can download the PDF and start learning immediately. (One quick note for Mac users. Don't try to open the PDFs using Preview. You have to use Reader to view them.)</p>
