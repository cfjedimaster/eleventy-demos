How secure are the usernames and passwords of scheduled tasks in the ColdFusion admin console?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think the answer is - it depends. I did a quick test and added a username of 'user' and password of 'pass' to a scheduled task. I then clicked to edit it again and the password was in the form. It was a password field, but view source showed it. If someone got access to your ColdFusion admin, they could see the password.</p>
<p>You can also dig into your ColdFusion lib folder and find neo-cron.xml. This is an XML file that defines all the scheduled tasks. The username was there, in plain text:</p>
<code>
&lt;var name='username'&gt;&lt;string&gt;user&lt;/string&gt;&lt;/var&gt;
</code>
<p>But the password was encrypted:</p>
<code>
&lt;var name='password'&gt;&lt;string&gt;(P(BMZG]$VZ\ &lt;char code='0a'/&gt;&lt;/string&gt;&lt;/var&gt;
</code>
<p>Of course, if someone gets access to your lib XML files, they can just disable the ColdFusion administrator password and view the entry via the form.</p>
<p>All in all I'd say - pretty secure unless someone gets access to the machine itself. Locked down completely 100% super-duper government agent safe? Probably not. Reasonably secure though.</p>
