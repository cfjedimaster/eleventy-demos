<p>Yesterday I <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2009/3/26/Using-jQuery-to-validate-the-sum-of-form-fields">blogged</a> about how you can use jQuery to validate the sum of a set of form fields. I had some great feedback, including a comment by <a href="http://flexoop.com/">Gareth Arch</a>. He raised the point that - if you had 2 form fields that need to sum to 100, why not simply just let the user edit one field and automatically set the value of the other?</p>
<p>I liked this idea - but I didn't want to block editing of one particular field. Depending on how you feel you may want to edit either of the two fields. I based my modification on my <a href="http://www.coldfusionjedi.com/demos/cv/cv2.html">last demo</a> and added the following:</p>
<code>
function setTo100() {	
	var theVal = parseInt($(this).val())
	var otherVal = 100-theVal
	if(this.id == 'phappy') $("#puhappy").val(otherVal)
	else $("#phappy").val(otherVal)
}
<p>$(&quot;#phappy&quot;).change(setTo100)
$(&quot;#puhappy&quot;).change(setTo100)
</code></p>
<p>Simply - I monitor the change event for my two form fields. When run, I get the value of the field changed and figure out what the other should be. I then look at the ID of the field changed and simply update the other one.</p>
<p>Simple and easy. You can demo this <a href="http://www.coldfusionjedi.com/demos/cv/cv3.html">here</a>.</p>
