<p>Earlier this week I <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2009/3/30/Ask-a-Jedi-CFCHART-and-Scaling-to-Decimal-Points">blogged</a> about an issue with ColdFusion charting and scaling to decimal points. While working on the solution, I did a small tweak to the x-axis to the turn the labels vertical. Why? Look what happens when there isn't enough room for the x-axis labels:</p>

<p>Things get scrunchy and random labels are dropped. Changing them to a vertical orientation helps, but what if you don't want vertical labels?</p>
<p>I discovered another option - oddly placed (odd to me anyway) in the &quot;Group&quot; section of the x-axis area in the cart editor:</p>

<p>Skip labels does pretty much what is says - skips labels. Setting it to 1 means it will skip every other label. So using the same data we did from the <a href="http://www.coldfusionjedi.com/index.cfm/2009/3/30/Ask-a-Jedi-CFCHART-and-Scaling-to-Decimal-Points">previous</a> blog entry, I modified the style xml like so:</p>
<code>
&lt;xAxis&gt;
  &lt;labelFormat pattern="#,##0.###"/&gt;
  &lt;parseFormat pattern="#,##0.###"/&gt;
  &lt;groupStyle skipLabels="1"/&gt;
&lt;/xAxis&gt;
</code>
<p>This results in:</p>

<p>Which I think is a nice alternative. Here is the vertical version for comparison:</p>

<p>Anyway, I hope this helps someone.</p>
