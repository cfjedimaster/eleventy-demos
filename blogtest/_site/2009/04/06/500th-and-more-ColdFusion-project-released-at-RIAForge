<p>Tonight I approved the 500th and 501st project at RIAForge. Lucky number 500 was <a href="http://kopieit.riaforge.org/">kopie.it</a>, a wrapper involving print services uploaded by Jeremy DeYoung. Because I have no pride (plenty of people will attest to that) I bugged Adam Lehman to offer up something as a reward. Jeremy will now be getting a free copy of ColdFusion Standard. (Thank you Adam + Adobe!) Project 501 was a <a href="http://constantcontactapi.riaforge.org/">Constant Contact</a> wrapper created by Jonah Blossom.</p>
<p>How does ColdFusion stack up to other product categories on RIAForge? Here is a completely gratuitous chart, courtesy of Google. I think it demonstrates the composition well:</p>
