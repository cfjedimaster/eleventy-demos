Just a reminder that <a href="http://express.cfunited.com/go/atlanta/2009/">CFUnited Express Atlanta</a> will be April 15, next week, in Atlanta, Georgia. I'll be flying up that morning and doing my very first presentation on Transfer. What an excellent opportunity to come see me fall on my face (or do rather well, I say you guys take bets on what the outcome is). I'll probably bring along a WACK or two to give away. Hope to see you there!
