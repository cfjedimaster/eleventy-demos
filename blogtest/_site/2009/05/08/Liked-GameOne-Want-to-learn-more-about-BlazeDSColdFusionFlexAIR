<p>Just wanted to give a quick shout out to Aaron West and his <a href="http://www.trajiklyhip.com/blog/index.cfm/2009/5/8/Announcing-My-AIR-BlazeDS-and-ColdFusion-Talk-at-CFUnited-2009">blog entry</a> on a class he will be giving at <a href="http://www.cfunited.com">CFUNITED</a> this year:</p>
<p><a href="http://cfunited.com/2009/topics#topic-338">AIR Messaging: Integrating AIR, BlazeDS, and ColdFusion</a></p>
<p>I <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2009/4/26/Code-and-Design-of-Gameone">blogged</a> about this myself recently with the release of my first proof of concept game built using AIR/Flex/CF/BlazeDS. I've got to say this is <i>very</i> exciting stuff. If you are attending CFUNITED, be sure to check out his talk. (I know I will be, if I'm not speaking at the same time.)</p>
