<h1>Post</h1>

<p>First off, sorry for the short amount of blogging this week. I've got some personal matters tomorrow so I've been working hard all week to take most of tomorrow off, <i>and</i> I've got jury duty coming up on Monday which is putting me in a slight panic mode as well. As an independent contractor, jury duty is going to be pretty tough if I can't get out of it. I did do a few small updates this week to my open source projects. (And by &quot;I&quot; I mean reviewed and uploaded, which is the way good projects should work, right? :)</p>
<p><a href="http://blogcfc.riaforge.org">BlogCFC</a> and <a href="http://canvas.riaforge.org">Canvas</a> both had minor updates specifically to help with Oracle issues. Thanks go to Nick Hill since I'd rather shove nails through my eyes than test on Oracle.</p>
<p><a href="http://pdfutils.riaforge.org">pdfUtils</a> had a few updates related to getExtraInfo function. One update included supported for showing page orientation. Sexy stuff, eh? Thanks go to Reto Aeberli for submitting multiple fixes/updates in this area.</p>
