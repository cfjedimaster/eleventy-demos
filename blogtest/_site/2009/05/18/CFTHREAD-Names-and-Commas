<p>Just a quick note to warn folks. When using cfthread with a dynamic name, don't forget that commas are not allowed. Outside of that, you can use any name you want to for the thread, as long as it is non-empty. Here is a quick example:</p>
<code>
&lt;cfthread name="-^p^-"&gt;
thread
&lt;/cfthread&gt;
<p>&lt;cfdump var=&quot;#cfthread#&quot;&gt;
</code></p>
<p>While that's a stupid name for a thread, it works just fine. Changing it to:</p>
<code>
&lt;cfthread name="-^p^-,cow bell"&gt;
thread
&lt;/cfthread&gt;
<p>&lt;cfdump var=&quot;#cfthread#&quot;&gt;
</code></p>
<p>Gives you:  <b>Attribute validation error in the cfthread tag. The thread name -^P^-,COW BELL is invalid. Thread names cannot be empty and should not contain a comma.</b></p>
<p>In my case, the bug involved cfthread code being used in BlogCFC to handle pings. The blog title was used in naming the thread call and in this one example it had included a comma. (Kinda surprised this didn't come up before.)</p>
<p>So why does this restriction exist? When you use the JOIN action of cfthread, you are asked to provide a list of thread names. Because this list must always use a comma-delimited list of names, you can't, and shouldn't be able to, create a thread name that also includes a comma. I guess Adobe could add a DELIMITER attribute to the tag but that seems like overkill if you ask me.</p>
