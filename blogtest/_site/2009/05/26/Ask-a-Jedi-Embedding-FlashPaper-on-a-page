<p>Rob wrote me yesterday asking about cfdocument and FlashPaper. FlashPaper? Yes, <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flashpaper/">FlashPaper</a>. FlashPaper was an alternative to PDF created back before Adobe swallowed up Macromedia. I thought the product was dead, but apparently you can still purchase it. As you can guess, it is a &quot;document&quot; type product, much like PDF, but it uses Flash for rendering into of the PDF engine. ColdFusion has supported generating FlashPaper ever since cfdocument was released. Here is a quick example.</p>

<p>First, use the cfdocument tag with FlashPaper as a format.</p>
<code>
&lt;cfdocument format="flashpaper"&gt;
	&lt;img src="http://www.adobe.com/images/shared/product_logos/159x120/159x120_flashpaper.gif" align="left"&gt;
	&lt;cfloop index="x" from="1" to="10"&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;cfoutput&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Para #x#&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/cfoutput&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/cfloop&gt;
&lt;/cfdocument&gt;
</code>
<p>This outputs Flash on the page with an embedded toolbar on top:</p>

<p>One of the cool things about FlashPaper is that it can more easily be embedded in a page. As far as I know, PDF can't be. It either takes over the entire web page, or, at least on my machine, it just gets downloaded. However, if you try to use cfdocument/format=&quot;flashpaper&quot; with other HTML you will see that the FlashPaper takes over the entire page.</p>
<p>Here is one workaround. Don't forget that cfdocument can take it's generated binary data and store it to a variable. This is true for both PDF and FlashPaper.</p>
<code>
&lt;cfdocument format="flashpaper" name="f"&gt;
</code>
<p>Once you have this data, you can save it to the file system and include it as you normally would with object/embed tags:</p>
<code>
&lt;h2&gt;Test&lt;/h2&gt;
<p>&lt;cfdocument format=&quot;flashpaper&quot; name=&quot;f&quot;&gt;
&lt;cfloop index=&quot;x&quot; from=&quot;1&quot; to=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;cfoutput&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Para #x#&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/cfoutput&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/cfloop&gt;
&lt;/cfdocument&gt;
&lt;cffile action=&quot;write&quot; file=&quot;#expandPath('./somefilename.swf')#&quot; output=&quot;#f#&quot;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;object width=&quot;550&quot; height=&quot;500&quot;&gt;
&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;somefilename.swf&quot;&gt;
&lt;embed src=&quot;somefilename.swf&quot; width=&quot;550&quot; height=&quot;400&quot;&gt;
&lt;/embed&gt;
&lt;/object&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;
Footer
&lt;/p&gt;
</code></p>
<p>Obviously you would probably use SWFObject, or another JavaScript library, to generate the HTML. You would also probably need to use a dynamic filename for the SWF. Here is the result:</p>

<p>After I sent Rob this version, I did a quick Google check and found the Terry Ryan had actually built a nice little CFC to make this even easier: <a href="http://www.numtopia.com/terry/programming/code_flashpaper_embedder.cfm">Flashpaper Embedder</a></p>
