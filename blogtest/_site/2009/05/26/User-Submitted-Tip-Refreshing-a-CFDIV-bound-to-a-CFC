<p>I swear this is something I may have covered before, but I'm not finding it in my archives. Either way, it's a good tip and I wanted to share it. Markus Wollny was working with a CFDIV tag that was bound to a CFC:</p>
<code>
&lt;cfdiv id="ivactid" bind="cfc:article.getCuriVactid()"&gt;&lt;/cfdiv&gt;
</code>
<p>The problem he ran into was refreshing the data in the grid. Normally a bound CFDIV (or other UI item) would 'listen' in to a particular form field and notice when it changed. In his case, there was no form field included in the bind.</p>
<p>To get around this, he simply used ColdFusion.navigate on the DIV and switched to a URL version of his CFC:</p>
<code>
ColdFusion.navigate('article.cfc?method=getCuriVactid','ivactid')
</code>
<p>In order for this to work the CFC has to return a string as a result, and unless the cffunction tag declares it explicitly, you will need to use a returnFormat of plain:</p>
<code>
ColdFusion.navigate('article.cfc?method=getCuriVactid&returnFormat=plain','ivactid')
</code>
<p>Thanks for sharing this, Markus.</p>
