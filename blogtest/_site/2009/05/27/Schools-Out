<p>Ok, so this is <i>way</i> off topic, but I wanted to share for all the old timers, like myself, out there. Today is my eldest child's last day of school (the younger two had their last day on Friday). While talking to my son I remembered an episode of the Muppets with Alice Cooper singing School's Out. I wasn't surprised at all to find it on YouTube...</p>

<p>Keep watching this at least until the point were Alice rips off his cap and gown and parades around in a red devil suit with a tail. Is it just me, or is kids programming today just a little bit boring? Of course, my kids didn't care for the video at all. Jaded at such a young age. -sigh-</p>
