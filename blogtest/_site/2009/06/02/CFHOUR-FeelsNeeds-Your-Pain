<h1>Post</h1>

<p>The CFHOUR podcast is <a href="http://blog.dkferguson.com/index.cfm/2009/6/1/CFHOUR-QA-Show--Learning-pain-points">looking for submissions</a> for it's next podcast. The topic of the podcast is pain points for new developers. We all know that ColdFusion is easy, but at the same time, there are certain things (<i>&lt;cough&gt;OO&lt;/cough&gt;</i>) that trip up developers as they use ColdFusion more and more. There are some excellent ideas on the <a href="http://blog.dkferguson.com/index.cfm/2009/6/1/CFHOUR-QA-Show--Learning-pain-points">blog post</a> already but please add your suggestions and be sure to turn in to the broadcast (which is next week I believe).</p>
