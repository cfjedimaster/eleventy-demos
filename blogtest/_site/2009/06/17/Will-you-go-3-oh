<p>Last year I <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2008/7/11/So-far-iPhone-20-is-DOA">blogged</a> about my experience upgrading my iPhone to 2.0. Little did I know that within a few hours I'd have a few hundred comments. It ended up being the most commented blog entry on my blog (972, almost 1k!) and my 6th most visited entry over all.</p>
<p>So given that the upgrade was a bit... rough last time - who is going to hold off doing the upgrade this time? I know I'm not going to wait. Working at home, even if my phone bricks, it isn't the end of the world.</p>
