<h1>Post</h1>

<p>A few months ago I posted a quick blog entry on <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2009/2/25/Metadata-properties-for-CFFEED--Atom">metadata properties</a> for creating Atom feeds in ColdFusion. This is not well documented in the ColdFusion docs, so I had to spend time reading the spec to get what I needed to pass to ColdFusion.</p>
<p>I exchanged a few emails with Chris and wanted to share some of what we found.</p>

<p>The first issue he had was with links for his Atom feed. He tried using a columnMap value of atomLink:</p>
<code>
&lt;cfset columnmap = structNew() /&gt;
&lt;cfset columnmap.title = "title" /&gt;
&lt;cfset columnmap.atomlink = "pub_url" /&gt;
&lt;cfset columnmap.publisheddate = "date_published_utc" /&gt;
&lt;cfset columnmap.content = "description" /&gt;
</code>
<p>This failed with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
There is a problem in the column mappings specified in the columnMap structure. The cffeed query does not contain any column by the name of ATOMLINK.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a <b>bad</b> error. His query certainly did contain the column. However, AtomLink isn't valid for Atom feeds. If you read the docs for <a href="http://livedocs.adobe.com/coldfusion/8/htmldocs/Tags_f_01.html#4002452">CFFEED</a>, you will see there is a large table that describes what columns map to both RSS and Atom feeds. From here I found that the column he wants is linkhref.</p>
<code>
&lt;cfset columnmap = structNew() /&gt;
&lt;cfset columnmap.title = "title" /&gt;
&lt;cfset columnmap.linkhref = "link"/&gt;
&lt;cfset columnmap.publisheddate = "posted" /&gt;
</code>
<p>The next problem was weirder. He used the content property to point to his query:</p>
<code>
&lt;cfset columnmap.content = "body" /&gt;
</code>
<p>This worked, but anytime the body column had a comma in it, the data would only render to the comma. So if content was: &quot;Camden, Raymond&quot;, then you would see &quot;Camden&quot; in the XML. Checking the Atom reference for <a href="http://www.atomenabled.org//developers/syndication/atom-format-spec.php#element.content">content</a>, all I saw mentioned was that the content type could be text, html, or xhtml. I added a new column to my query called content type, and supplied it first with the value text. This didn't work. I then tried html and xhtml and those didn't work as well. The only thing the Atom spec mentioned (unless I read too quick) was that HTML needed to be escaped, but even simple strings refused to work.</p>
<p>Chris found another solution though. If you use the summary column than it works just fine. From what I read of the spec, summary is probably a better fit for RSS feeds anyway.</p>
<p>I hope this helps. Frankly I almost feel like Atom feeds are too much trouble. They are more powerful then RSS2 in that they can be more descriptive, but shoot, it seems like a real hassle to actually use them.</p>
