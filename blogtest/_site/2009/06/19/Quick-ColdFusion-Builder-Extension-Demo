<p>I thought Brian Rinaldi did a great job <a href="http://www.remotesynthesis.com/post.cfm/preview-of-the-framework-skeletons-bolt-plugin">previewing his Bolt plugin</a> a few days ago so I thought I'd do the same. Below is a video demonstrating the <a href="http://riaforgedownloader.riaforge.org/">RIAForge Downloader</a> ColdFusion Builder extension. It's a bit rushed, but I think the capabilities of CFB are <i>really</i> exciting, and the video shows you just one example of that. Enjoy. (Click the graphic to go the movie.)</p>
