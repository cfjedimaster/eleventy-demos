<p>Just ran across an interesting bug in some code I'm reviewing. I've done this myself a few times so I certainly don't blame the original developer. Read this real quick and tell me what the output is:</p>
<!--more-->
<code>
&lt;cffunction name="returnNothing" output="false" returnType="string" hint="Ask Paris Hilton about WW2."&gt;
	&lt;cfreturn ""&gt;
&lt;/cffunction&gt;
<p>&lt;cfif len(returnNothing)&gt;
Yes, this ran, and it never should!
&lt;cfelse&gt;
Perfect - I got nothing back. As I expected.
&lt;/cfif&gt;
</code></p>
<p>If you said &quot;Perfect...&quot;, then you are incorrect. Notice the cfif. We called the UDF, and it should have returned a blank string, right? Well, we didn't actually <i>call</i> the UDF. See the missing ()?</p>
<p>So why did len() return true? You can see this for yourself. Running:</p>
<code>
&lt;cfoutput&gt;#returnNothing#&lt;/cfoutput&gt;
</code>
<p>outputs:</p>
<p>cftest22ecfm1623321220$funcRETURNNOTHING@76e45ffe</p>
<p>Which I believe is simply a toString version of the UDF. (Actually I compared it to #toString(returnNothing)# and I got the same thing.)</p>
<p>So - raise your hand if you've made this mistake as well!</p>
