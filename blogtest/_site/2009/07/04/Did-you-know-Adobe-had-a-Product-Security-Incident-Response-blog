<p>I didn't! Thanks to Hemant for pointing this out to me. You can find this blog here: <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/psirt/">http://blogs.adobe.com/psirt/</a>. I've pinged Adobe to find out a bit more about how and why content shows up here. You won't see anything about the MIME issue, but as that is a coder thing not a product thing (imho), it may not make sense here. Either way - one more blog to monitor I suppose. It's not ColdFusion specific, but I'm adding it to <a href="http://www.coldfusionbloggers.org">ColdFusionBloggers.org</a> now.</p>
