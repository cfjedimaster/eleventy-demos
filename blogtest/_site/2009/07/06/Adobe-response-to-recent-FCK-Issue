<p>I just re-tweeted this, and those who keep up to date on <a href="http://www.coldfusionbloggers.org">ColdFusionBloggers</a> will see it as well, but just to help spread the news, please read Terry's blog post:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.terrenceryan.com/blog/index.cfm/2009/7/6/Questions-about-the-FCKEditor-Vulnerability-in-ColdFusion">Questions about the FCKEditor Vulnerability in ColdFusion</a></p>
<p>I think folks may not be entirely happy with his post - but please post your comments directly to him.</p>
<p>FYI, I am working on - but don't want to promise anything just yet - so more support/discussion about this and other ColdFusion/security issues as well. I'll blog more when I can.</p>
