<p>With the release of ColdFusion 9, Adobe also produced some ColdFusion 9 specific videos. By Adobe I mean Ben and I. ;) You can find these videos at Labs: <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/coldfusion9/videos/">http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/coldfusion9/videos/</a></p>
<p>This was my first time working in front of a green screen, and it was pretty cool actually.</p>

<p><i>Everything</i> you see behind me there is 100% virtual. I know green screen tech isn't new, but it's still kinda cool to see it in action!</p>
<p>I've attached a zip to this blog entry that contains all the code I used when working with the videos. Some of the VFS files won't work as they require a database, but I think it will give you enough of an idea as to what is going on.<p><a href='enclosures/E%3A%5Chosts%5Cwww%2Ecoldfusionjedi%2Ecom%5Cenclosures%2Fforblogpost%2Ezip'>Download attached file.</a></p></p>
