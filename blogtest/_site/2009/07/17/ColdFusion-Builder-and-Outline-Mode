<p>I've been using ColdFusion Builder full time for probably close to six weeks now. In that time I've really come to depend on one feature in particular, the Outline Mode. I'm not sure why I ignored it at first. I guess I just kinda thought that an outline of my code wouldn't be really helpful. But then I started working on a project where the developers didn't follow the same CFC writing patterns as I did. (My 'pattern' is - init method first, then everything else in Alpha Order.) The Outline panel became a killer feature for me. Here is a quick video that hopefully demonstrates how useful this can be.</p>
