<h1>Post</h1>

<p>Been a while since I posted a challenge, and today I had a good idea for a new one. Given a source image, divide the picture into 100 squares, and then paste these squares into a <i>new</i> picture in random order. This will create a mixed up version of the source image. You can assume a decent sized image (minimum of 200x200 pixels). Post your solution, and if you can, URLs to some sample output. As one hint, don't forget ColdFusion has the ability to paste images into canvases.</p>
