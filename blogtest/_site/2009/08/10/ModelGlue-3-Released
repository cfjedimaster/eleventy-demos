<p><img src="http://model-glue.com/images/mgTabletColdFusion.gif" align="left"> Model-Glue 3 has been released. And um, yeah, that's it. I've been using version 3 for a while now, and if you've avoided taking the time to learn a framework, now is the perfect time to pick one up. Model-Glue is an incredible framework, and the 3rd version is the best yet. The <a href="http://docs.model-glue.com/">documentation</a> has been given some serious love as well.</p>
<p>Download the latest bits from here: <a href="http://model-glue.com/coldfusion.cfm">http://model-glue.com/coldfusion.cfm</a></p>
<p>My favorite 3.0 feature? It's a toss up between the improved bean injection, typed events, and the Helper scope.</p>
