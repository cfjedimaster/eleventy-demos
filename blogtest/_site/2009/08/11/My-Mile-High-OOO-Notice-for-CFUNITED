<p>I'm blogging from a plane. Seriously. Ok, so it's not new - Wifi has been on a few planes now for a few months at least, but it's my first time. I met a fellow CFUNITED attendee and he shared a free pass, so not only if it Wifi in the Sky, but free wifi at that.</p>
<p>Anyway, please consider this my official Out of Office notice for the next few days as I attend CFUNITED. I'll be picking up a new session (to go with my 3 others) on Application.cfc development. That will be Wednesday at 1:30 PM. Michael Dinowitz couldn't make it so he asked if I could help him out. As I'm a glutton for punishment I quickly agreed. It may be a bit rough, but that just makes it more fun, right?</p>
<p>Anyway - I hope to see my fellow ColdFusion geeks in the next few hours and I can't wait for tomorrow! Please <a href="http://www.twitter.com/cfjedimaster">follow</a> me on Twitter as I'll probably be using that a lot more than the blog this week.</p>
