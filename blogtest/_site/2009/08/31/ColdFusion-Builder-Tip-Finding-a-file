<p>I'm working with a new client that has a rather large and complex code base. Since I'm still kinda new to the project I don't know where everything exists. I needed to find a particular file name within the project and discovered that ColdFusion Builder (Eclipse really!) provides a simple way to do it.</p>

<p>First, go to the Search menu like you would when searching for text within a project. Remove anything from &quot;Containing text&quot; and under FIle name patterns, just type in the actual file name. Lastly, be sure your scope is set to Selected resources.</p>
<p>Here is a simple example of searching for blog.cfc within my BlogCFC5 project:</p>

<p>The result will pop up in the Search panel:</p>

<p>As I said - this is more an Eclipse thing than a ColdFusion Builder feature, but it never occurred to me to use the search feature to find a particular file. Pretty obvious now I guess but it's going to be a life saver with me on this project.</p>
