<p>Just a quick note here. My buddy Todd Sharp's web site, <a href="http://www.slidesix.com">SlideSix</a>, was nominated for the Best of RIA 2009 poll being run by InsideRIA(*). The good news is that SlideSix has survived the first round of voting and is now in the semi-finals. <b>Please help show your support for SlideSix and ColdFusion in the RIA space by voting today!</b> You can vote here: <a href="http://www.insideria.com/2009/08/new-poll-the-best-of-ria-2009-1.html">http://www.insideria.com/2009/08/new-poll-the-best-of-ria-2009-1.html</a></p>
<p>Secondly, SlideSix also added widgets this weekend. You can find the details on <a href="http://cfsilence.com/blog/client/index.cfm/2009/8/31/SlideSix-Gets-A-New-Home-Page-Again-And-Widgets">Todd's blog post</a>. I've added a list of my presentations to my <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/page.cfm/About-Me">About Me</a> page. I never have to update it again - instead the widget will just update automagically for me. And as Cartman would say....</p>
