<p>I was in a development meeting earlier today and the following typo came up on screen:</p>
<code>
x = "That's no moon. It's a space station.";
writeOutput (x);
</code>
<p>Notice the space? What was odd though was that ColdFusion Builder did <b>not</b> flag it as an error. On a whim I tried it and it actually worked. I even added about 20 spaces between the end of writeOutput and the left parenthesis and it ran with no complaints.</p>
<p>Weird - and useless - but kind of interesting how ColdFusion Builder helped me discover something I didn't know you could do.</p>
