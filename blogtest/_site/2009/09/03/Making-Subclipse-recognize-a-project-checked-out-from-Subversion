<p>When I typically work with Subclipse, I begin my project doing a checkout. Today I added Subclipse to install of ColdFusion Builder where one of the projects was already pointing to a working directory. I expected, perhaps foolishly, that Subclipse would recognize the .svn folder and just - um - do it's thing. No joy. I happened to guess upon a working solution though and thought I'd share with others. <b>Warning</b> - I have yet to actually commit or update - but I did confirm that I could compare against the latest in the repository.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Right click on your project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select Team.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select Shared Project.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This is the part I was most unsure of. I didn't want to share - the project was already shared. But Subclipse recognized that the project was already shared and noted that. I clicked the Finish button and then stood back.</p>
<p>Eclipse began to chew. And chew. Progress windows opened up and closed by themselves. After about 30 seconds or so the demonic possession seemed complete - but I still didn't have little funky graphics next to my files signifying their state. On a whim I tried a Refresh and that seemed to do the trick.</p>
<p>Hope this helps others.</p>
