<p>Wow, this is pretty cool. While researching ColdBox this morning I ran across a <b>very</b> cool thing - apparently the WebCharts folks created an Eclipse plugin to aid in your chart editing. More details may be found <a href="http://www.gpoint.com/website/WebCharts50/products/eclipse.jsp">here</a>. This allows you to edit charts directly in Eclipse as opposed to running the BAT/sh file at the command line.</p>
<p>Installation proved a bit tricky for me. On my Snow Leopard Mac, the plugin never worked. Period. On my Windows 7 laptop, it worked in ColdFusion Builder. On my Mac laptop that isn't running Snow Leopard, it didn't work with ColdFusion Builder but did work with my vanilla Eclipse install.</p>
<p>Once you get it working then you can create a new Chart project by using the New/Other menu. There should be a new WebCharts3D option:</p>

<p>You can create the project anywhere - I just saved it in my web root. I picked the first web chart and then it loaded the preview directly in Eclipse. I had to enable the General/Properties window to allow me to edit the chart, but once I did, I was able to edit the chart to meet my stringent design requirements:</p>

<p><b>Properties pane:</b><br>

<p>Pretty cool I think - and hopefully the lack of support on my Mac ColdFusion Builder will be corrected in a later build.</p>
