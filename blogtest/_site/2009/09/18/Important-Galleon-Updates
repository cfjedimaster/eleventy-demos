<h1>Post</h1>

<p>I've twittered this a few times, but I want to ensure I reach everyone. If you are a <a href="http://galleon.riaforge.org">Galleon</a> user, please <b>update now</b>. I'm going to go into details why next week, but be sure to update right now. As always, I provide details about the files modified in the readme.txt file, so be sure to read it closely. Again, I'll provide details in a few days.</p>
