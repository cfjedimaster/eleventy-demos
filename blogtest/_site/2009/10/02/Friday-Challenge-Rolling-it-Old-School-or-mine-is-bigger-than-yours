As you know, encapsulating code and reuse is a &quot;Good Thing (tm)&quot;. ColdFusion has long had good options for this - from the simple cfinclude, to custom tags and UDFs, to CFCs. Of course, just because you use a CFC doesn't mean your code is organized nicely. Case in point - BlogCFC. The core component for my blog comes in at a whopping <b>3087</b> lines. That doesn't automatically mean that its bad, but.... well, you get the idea.</p>
<p>So here is the challenge. Using <a href="http://pastebin.com/">Pastebin</a> (not the comments!) share the source of the largest file you have ever created. You <b>must</b> share the code. If you can't, too bad. The person with the largest number of lines will win. (With &quot;win&quot; being a bit relative. ;)
