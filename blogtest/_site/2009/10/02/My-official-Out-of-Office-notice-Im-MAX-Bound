<p>OK, so technically I'm not leaving for MAX till 7AM tomorrow morning, but please consider this my &quot;I'm outa here, see ya later&quot; notice. As always, the rule is that you will not find any bugs in my open source software while I'm gone (old school or not). On a serious note, any emails sent to me over the next week may take a while to respond to, so give me a bit of time to catch up in the next few weeks. I'll also remind folks about my Twitter account (<a href="http://twitter.com/cfjedimaster">cfjedimaster</a>) as I'll probably be writing a lot more tweets than blog entries. Los Angeles, here I come!</p>

<p>p.s. Freaky, a few seconds before I hit Save on this blog entry, Google sent me a SMS to remind me of MAX. ;)</p>
