<p>Now <i>this</i> this is surprising. During my first presentation on ColdFusion 9 and ORM, I was asked about security permissions on DSNs and how they impact ORM. So for example, if you go into the Advanced Settings of a DSN and only allow certain operations (Select, Update, etc), will that impact ORM? I told the attendee that I honestly wasn't sure, but that I'd assume it would.</p>
<p>Turns out I was completely wrong. I edited one of my examples so that only SELECT operations were allowed. But this had no impact on the ORM operations I was allowed to do. I could still update, delete, and insert.</p>
<p>As I said - surprising - but I'm guessing that the DSN security operations must be something that ORM just doesn't go through.</p>
