<p>As has been Twittered around this morning, the MAX sessions are now coming online. Even if you didn't actually buy a ticket for MAX, you can watch <b>all</b> the sessions (just sessions, no labs) online for free at <a href="http://tv.adobe.com/">Adobe TV</a>.</p>
<p>You can find my ORM session (not quite sure if they have both the Monday and Tuesday one - I think Monday went a bit better) here: <a href="http://tv.adobe.com/watch/max-2009-develop/introduction-to-coldfusion-orm/">http://tv.adobe.com/watch/max-2009-develop/introduction-to-coldfusion-orm/</a></p>
<p>You can download the code and slides themselves from the version I uploaded to <a href="http://slidesix.com/view/Introduction-to-ORM-in-ColdFusion-9">SlideSix</a>. I'd normally just embed that version below, but I'm having issues getting SlideSix to remember the recorded URL for my presentation.</p>
<p>If anyone has any questions about the code, please let me know. I'm going to do a blog entry that looks over the deeper examples from the presentation that I didn't have time to cover. Also - and I'd like some feedback on this - I was considering updating my long Transfer series. I think it could be cool to a 'entry to entry' update with ColdFusion 9.</p>
