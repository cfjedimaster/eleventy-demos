<p>Adobe recently released their updated Cookbooks site, including the new <a href="http://cookbooks.adobe.com/coldfusion">ColdFusion Cookbook</a>. To help get the cookbook filled with content even quicker, Ed Sullivan has <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/adc/2009/10/coldfusion_cookbook_contest_-.html">announced</a> that if you are one of the first 100 people to make a submission, you will be entered into a raffle to win a <b>free copy</b> of ColdFusion 9!</p>
<p>p.s. In case folks are curious about the old ColdFusion Cookbook content, data is still being copied over by hand. I know that my entries aren't migrated yet but will soon be. (Or I'll start throwing down a hissy fit - I've been trained by my 8 year old daughter on the proper way to do that.)</p>
