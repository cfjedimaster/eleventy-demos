<p>Registration has opened up for the <a href="http://bflex.info/">BFusion/BFlex</a> conference this weekend. This is a two day conference covering ColdFusion and Flex. It's being held in Bloomington, Indiana and can be attended for the low price of 10 dollars. AIR and Flash Catalyst will also be discussed. If you are in the area (or can make the drive, come on, it's 10 dollars!) than I'd definitely recommend attending!</p>
