<blockquote>
Having an interesting dilemma that I cannot seem to come up with a
working solution to. I have a text box that we need people to enter a time
into. I dont want it to be a mask but rather onBlur the string "completes"
with the proper format. For example, the user enters 3:29.2 for their time,
onBlur the result needs to be 00:03:29.20. Or the user enters 4.6, onblur 
should result in 00:00:04.60. Just curious if you could point me in the 
right direction or come up with a demo, I think this would be very useful to
many folks as a blog entry.

<p>So let me state right off - I really don't like formatting in JavaScript. If I'm doing any kind of Ajax development and need the data to look nice, I will almost always do the formatting in ColdFusion first. ColdFusion has spoiled me, what can I say? So please keep that in mind when reviewing my solution. There are probably a hundred different ways to do this (better) but hopefully this will be helpful anyway.</p>

<p>For my solution, I decided to do something a bit different. Instead of building a form and using the onblur as Patrick wanted, I thought I'd build something like a test script. The idea would be that I could provide an array of inputs and when the page loaded, it would run through them all and output the results. Here is what I came up with initially.</p>
<code>
&lt;h2&gt;Tests&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="testDiv"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
<p>&lt;script&gt;
var myarea = document.getElementById(&quot;testDiv&quot;)
var tests = [&quot;2.2&quot;,&quot;3:29.2&quot;]</p>
<p>for(var i=0;i&lt;tests.length;i++) {
myarea.innerHTML += &quot;&lt;br/&gt;&quot; + tests[i] + &quot; = &quot; + formatTime(tests[i])	
}</p>
<p>function formatTime(t) {
return t
}
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></p>
<p>I create a simple div on top. The JavaScript section begins by creating a pointer to it. The tests array represent all my inputs. Next I loop over the inputs and add to the div the initial value and the result of the format. As you can see, the format does nothing now. I ran this and got the following output:</p>

<p>Nice and simple. But the point is - I can easily then add more inputs and test the output to ensure my function works correctly. So now for the actual formatting - and again - consider this code rough - I know it could be improved:</p>
<code>
function formatTime(t) {
	//Desired result is hh:mm:ss.MM
	//Check for ., if not dot, assume it is just the seconds or more portion
	var ms = "00"
	if(t.indexOf(".") != -1) ms = t.split(".")[1]
<pre><code>var time = t.split(&quot;.&quot;)[0]
//so ms should be ok as is, but time may not be
var items = time.split(&quot;:&quot;)

//loop over length of size - 3
var toAdd = 3-items.length
for(var i=1; i &amp;lt;= toAdd; i++) {
	items.unshift(&quot;00&quot;)
}

//now fix each item - if size of the item is 1, prepend with 0
for(var i=0; i &amp;lt; items.length; i++) {
	if(items[i].length == 1) items[i] = &quot;0&quot; + items[i]
}

var timeStr = items.join(&quot;:&quot;)
return timeStr + &quot;.&quot; + ms
</code></pre>
<p>}
</code></p>
<p>I begin by grabbing the millisecond portion of the input - if it exists. The split function is a nice way to treat a JavaScript string like a ColdFusion list. The right side portion of the input is the hours, minutes, and seconds. Since a user may enter only seconds, or maybe only minutes and seconds, I may need to &quot;pad&quot; my data. So I split that portion on the colon character and if the size is less than three, I enter some blank values into the array. By the way, don't make the mistake I did:</p>
<code>
for(var i=1; i &lt;= (3-items.length); i++) {
	items.unshift("00")
}
</code>
<p>Can you guess why that failed?</p>
<p>Anyway, the next step was to convert any single character value, like &quot;3&quot;, into a fuller &quot;03&quot; string. Finally I can convert the array back into a string using join. Here is the complete test script with some additional inputs. As you can imagine, this version was not the first version I sent him. As he sent back bugs, I simply entered his inputs and updated the function:</p>
<code>
&lt;h2&gt;Tests&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="testDiv"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
<p>&lt;script&gt;
var myarea = document.getElementById(&quot;testDiv&quot;)
var tests = [&quot;2.2&quot;,&quot;3:29.2&quot;,&quot;4.6&quot;,&quot;3&quot;,&quot;03:22:10.4&quot;]</p>
<p>for(var i=0;i&lt;tests.length;i++) {
myarea.innerHTML += &quot;&lt;br/&gt;&quot; + tests[i] + &quot; = &quot; + formatTime(tests[i])	
}</p>
<p>function formatTime(t) {
//Desired result is hh:mm:ss.MM
//Check for ., if not dot, assume it is just the seconds or more portion
var ms = &quot;00&quot;
if(t.indexOf(&quot;.&quot;) != -1) ms = t.split(&quot;.&quot;)[1]</p>
<pre><code>var time = t.split(&quot;.&quot;)[0]
//so ms should be ok as is, but time may not be
var items = time.split(&quot;:&quot;)

//loop over length of size - 3
var toAdd = 3-items.length
for(var i=1; i &amp;lt;= toAdd; i++) {
	items.unshift(&quot;00&quot;)
}

//now fix each item - if size of the item is 1, prepend with 0
for(var i=0; i &amp;lt; items.length; i++) {
	if(items[i].length == 1) items[i] = &quot;0&quot; + items[i]
}

var timeStr = items.join(&quot;:&quot;)
return timeStr + &quot;.&quot; + ms
</code></pre>
<p>}
&lt;/script&gt;

<p>And the output:</p>
