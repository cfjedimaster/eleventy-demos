<p>I'm currently fighting (ok, not fighting - debugging - it just feels like a fight) an issue with a ColdFusion 9 site that makes heavy use of ORM. I thought it might help to take a look at the Hibernate config files generated, so I added this to my ormSettings structure in Application.cfc:</p>
<code>
&lt;cfset this.ormsettings = {
	dbcreate="update",
	logsql="true",
	eventhandling="true",
	savemapping="true"
}&gt;
</code>
<p>I reloaded my application and confirmed that in every folder containing my entity CFCs there was now a file named cfcname.hbmxml, where cfcname matched the name of the CFC.</p>
<p>Ok, so far so good. Back in ColdFusion Builder I refreshed my project so I could see the files. But since the extension wasn't recognized, CFB didn't know how to handle it. I had previously opened up HBMXML files with TextMate, so CFB recognized that and sent all requests for such files to TextMate. I wanted to see them within CFB instead so this is what I did. (And to be clear, this should work for any Eclipse product, not just CFB.)</p>
<p>I opened up my Preferences and went to General/Editors/File Associations.</p>

<p>Click add and specify *.hbmxml for the file type.</p>

<p>Lastly - click Add under Associated editors. Select CF Builder XML Editor.</p>

<p>Hit Ok to dismiss the preferences panel and you are done.</p>
