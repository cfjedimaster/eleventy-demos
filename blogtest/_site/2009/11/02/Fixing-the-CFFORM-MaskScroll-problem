<p>Dave asks:</p>
<blockquote>
I have a question regarding <cfinput> masks.
<br/><br/>
I'm using <cfform> which includes a few phone number entry fields. I'm applying a mask of "999-999-9999" (since it's all US phone numbers).  The resulting HTML includes a CF generated script that focuses the cursor on any fields that contain a mask in order to apply it to the initial value.
<br/><br/>
Is there a way to disable this but retain the mask?  My client is saying that the page "jumps" to the phone number fields instead of loading at the top of the page.

I wasn't quite sure what Dave meant, but I saw it quickly enough when I whipped up this demo:
<code>
&lt;h1&gt;Ray&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;cfoutput&gt;#repeatString("&lt;br/&gt;",120)#&lt;/cfoutput&gt;
<p>&lt;cfform name=&quot;form&quot;&gt;
Telephone: &lt;cfinput type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;tel&quot; mask=&quot;999-999-9999&quot;&gt;
&lt;/cfform&gt;
</code></p>
<p>So this is a bit contrived, but it definitely shows the issue. On load, you will be scrolled down to the telephone. When I viewed source I could see the focus() calls added by CFFORM. From what I saw, if I were to have multiple fields with masks, I would probably end up at the lowest possible form field.</p>
<p>My fix was simple - and it seemed to work ok. I simply ran code on page load to scroll back to the top:</p>
<code>
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
function init() {
	window.scrollTo(0,0)
}
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
<p>&lt;body onload=&quot;init()&quot;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Ray&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;cfoutput&gt;#repeatString(&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;,120)#&lt;/cfoutput&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;cfform name=&quot;form&quot;&gt;
Telephone: &lt;cfinput type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;tel&quot; mask=&quot;999-999-9999&quot;&gt;
&lt;/cfform&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></p>
<p>I thought this would result in a 'jump' effect, but it seemed to just load and stay on top for me (FireFox 3.5).</p>
