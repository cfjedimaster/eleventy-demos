<p>I just released <a href="http://blogcfc.riaforge.org">BlogCFC 5.9.5</a> to RIAForge. The readme describes all the changes, but the major focus in this release on improving the editor (lots of jQuery love!). I took a quick video demonstrating some of the new features. I know I need to get a better way of embedding videos on here, but for now the image below will take you to the SWF file directly.</p>

<p>Sorry for the all the &quot;uhs&quot; and junk. For some reason I tend to clench up when doing Jing videos. I blame the software. It can't be my fault!</p>
