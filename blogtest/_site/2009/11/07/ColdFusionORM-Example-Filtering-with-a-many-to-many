<p>Let me be clear - I'm not sure this is the <b>best</b> way to do this - but it worked and as it took me a while to Google up the answer and test it, I thought I'd share.</p>
<p>Ok - so imagine an entity that has a many-to-many relationship. A good example is a blog entry with many categories. Any one blog entry may have multiple categories assigned to it. How would you write a query to return all blog entries in a specific category? Here is how I did it (and I apologize for not linking to the post - I forget exactly what I saw this):</p>
<code>
&lt;cfset r = ormExecuteQuery("from blogentry as be left join be.categories as cat where cat.id=4")&gt;
</code>
<p>Obviously the 4 there is hard coded and would be replaced with a bound parameter.</p>
