<p>Two big announcements from two of the largest ColdFusion conferences. CFUNITED has opened its <a href="http://callforspeakers.cfconf.org/">call for speakers</a> for the 2010 year. cfObjective has also opened up their call for speakers. I was a bit surprised to find it <b>not</b> mentioned on the web site. You have to hit up <a href="http://corfield.org/blog/index.cfm/do/blog.entry/entry/cfObjective_2010__Call_For_Speakers">Sean Corfield's blog post</a> to get the form.</p>
