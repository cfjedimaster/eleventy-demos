<p>Hey folks - here are the slides and code from my Exploring ColdFusion as a Service presentation at RIAUnleashed. Please note that these slides and code deserve some explanation. I plan on doing a series of blog posts on CFaaS over the next few days to help others learn about this new ColdFusion 9 feature.</p>
