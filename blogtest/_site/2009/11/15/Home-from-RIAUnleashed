<p>I got home from Boston last night after attending <a href="http://www.riaunleashed.com">RIAUnleashed</a>. I want to thank Brian Rinaldi for asking me to speak there. He ran a <b>tremendous</b> conference. One day - densely packed - and a great combination of server side and client side sessions. I'd highly recommend folks attend next year. I know that not everyone can afford the money and time for the &quot;big&quot; conferences, so you should definitely consider RIAUnleashed. If any of the attendees read this blog, I'd love to hear your feelings as well.</p>
