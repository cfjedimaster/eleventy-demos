<p>Woot! Adobe's <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/air2/">AIR 2.0</a> has now been released to Labs. (Along with the <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/flashplayer10/">Flash Player 10.1</a> pre-release.) I'd recommend this excellent blog article by Christian Cantrell for more information: <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/cantrell/archives/2009/11/air_2_public_beta_resources.html">AIR 2 Public Beta Resources</a>.</p>
<p>I'd love to know - who out there is using AIR? Either for their business or for fun.</p>
