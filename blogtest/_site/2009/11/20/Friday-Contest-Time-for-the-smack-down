<p>Ok, let me start off by saying that I do <b>not</b> condone knocking other languages. I do it - in jest - mainly because I've had to deal with so much in return. I figure if we ColdFusion developers can take it, we can, from time to time, &quot;vent&quot; a bit and deal it back. As it stands, we get our code down in half the time anyway so we have the opportunity to goof off. A few weeks back I held a &quot;You are CF Dude&quot; contest. Jim Leether won that with this beauty:</p>

<p>Today its time to reverse it, go Bizzaro, or however you want to say it. Today's contest is &quot;You are Not CF Dude&quot;. As an example...</p>

<p>Submit your best picture (work safe please) and the winner will get another Amazon gift certificate. All languages are open - in fact - if you want to tease ColdFusion a bit, that's fine by me. Just have fun with it.</p>
<p>And again - folks - it is in good fun. I don't hate PHP or any other language. If this contest makes your mad, I suggest backing away from the computer and taking a few deep breathes. It's Friday - have fun!</p>
