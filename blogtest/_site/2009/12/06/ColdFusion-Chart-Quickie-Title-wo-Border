How do I hide the box/border surrounding the title in a cfchart?  Can that be done with attributes or does it need to pull from an xml style file?  The showBorder="yes"/"no"...doesn't seem to have any affect?
</blockquote>
<p>Correct - showBorder is for the chart as a whole. And like (almost) always - the chart editor comes to the rescue. Click the Title value in the chart editor opens up a sub editor with a butt load of options for the title:</p>

<p>Notice the style attribute on the right? That handles the border around the title. You can set it to a variety of different styles or just select &quot;None&quot; to get rid of it. The generated XML is:</p>
<code>
&lt;title&gt;
&lt;decoration style="None"/&gt;Poop
&lt;/title&gt;
</code>
<p>You can also play with the other styles and tweak the color too if you want.</p>
