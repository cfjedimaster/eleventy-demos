<p>There have been a few blog posts recently about issues with JSON and ColdFusion. Specifically issues concerning data being &quot;transformed&quot; into other data types. While there are a variety of ways to solve this issue, I thought I'd share one particular example, and one particular solution, I shared with a reader earlier today.</p>
<p>
<p>The reader was dealing with JSON returned from Facebook. This JSON packet contained a key called actor_id. When the data was translated from JSON some corruption occurred. You can see an example of this here. Notice how the third actor's ID was changed to scientific notation:</p>

<p>
<p>I took a look at the JSON string and noticed that the actor IDs all took this form:</p>
<p>
<code>
"actor_id":XXXXXXXX
</code>
<p>
<p>I decided to simply wrap the value portion in quotes using regex:</p>
<p>
<code>
&lt;cfset json = rereplace(json, '"actor_id":(.*?)([,}])', '"actor_id":"\1"\2', "all")&gt;
</code>
<p>
<p>Notice that the end of my regex matches either a comma or a } to handle it being in a middle position of the object at the end. (I also had to do this for a UID value that was being corrupted.) The result clearly shows that this helped:</p>

<p>
<p>I really, <b>really</b> like JSON, but I'm thinking that those of us who make use of it will need to be vigilant for issues like this. Considering that only <i>some</i> of the actor IDs values were transformed, it's easily something that could be missed earlier in development.</p>
