<p>In the past few weeks, I've gotten around 10 or so emails from people having issues downloading projects at <a href="http://www.riaforge.org">RIAForge</a>. Because RIAForge allows folks to point to external download locations, I typically just check to see if that is the issue. However - I've never been able to replicate any of the problems the users are having. They typically report that they get about half way through the download and it then simply stops.</p>
<p>When it was only a few users, I was willing to blame a bad network on their side - but now it is apparent that <i>something</i> is up. I just wanted to give folks a heads up that I'm looking into it. If any of my readers have seen a problem like this before and have some advice, I'd love to hear it.</p>
<p>RIAForge uses Apache 2.2, and for the most part, it just always works. (Although last night it stopped running for some reason. I haven't seen it to do that ever.) When project admins edit their projects and enable or disable SVN, we do perform a graceful restart, but as far as I know, that does not impact downloads.</p>
