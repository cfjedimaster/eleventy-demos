<p><a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/air2/">AIR 2.0</a> should be an amazing release. I highly recommend catching up on <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/cantrell/">Christian Cantrell's blog</a> as he has quite a few entries on the new release.</p>
<p><a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/flashplayer10/">Flash 10.1</a> is also now at beta 2. I've not followed the news much on this but from what I can see this will be an important update for mobile devices.</p>
<p>I hate to sound like a broken record, but, I'll say it again. For my readers who only know ColdFusion, now is the time to expand your skills and pick up AIR. Even if you don't want to learn Flex (which I recommend as well), you can simply build upon your existing HTML and JavaScript knowledge by adding the power of AIR.</p>
