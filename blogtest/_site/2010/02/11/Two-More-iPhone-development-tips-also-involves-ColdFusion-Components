<p>Earlier in the week I helped a reader with a iPhone issue he was having. From this came two things I'd like to share with folks. Number one - don't use Flash (sorry, couldn't resist!).</p>

<p>First - don't forget that Safari on the iPhone has a development mode. This is <b>critical</b> for getting any type of feedback for JavaScript errors. How do you enable this? Go to your Settings, Safari page. At the <i>very</i> bottom is a Developer menu. Click it and you will see...</p>

<p>Obviously you want to ensure the Debug Console is turned on. Once done, if you return to the browser and rerun your page with the error, you will see a new notice:</p>

<p>Clicking that option will give you some details about the error:</p>

<p>It's no Firebug, but it's better than nothing.</p>
<p>So what's the second tip? The error the user had involved a simple jQuery call to a CFC that returned JSON. It worked perfectly everywhere <i>but</i> the iPhone. Why? The iPhone didn't like the fact that the result didn't have the proper mime type. I asked him to add this line before his cfreturn: &lt;cfcontent type=&quot;application/json&quot; reset=&quot;true&quot;&gt;. Unfortunately this kinda breaks the reusability of the component. To be a bit more abstract, he could add a quick check for URL.returnFormat first and only use the content type when necessary.</p>
