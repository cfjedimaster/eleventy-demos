<p>Not sure why this wasn't given more of an announcement, but the first <a href="http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/825/cpsid_82536.html">cumulative hot fix</a> for ColdFusion 9 was released yesterday. Hit the link up for details on what was fixed. The best item I think is the JSON casting issue. I talked about that bug in a <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2009/10/19/ColdFusion-9-JSON-Bug">blog entry</a> back in October.</p>
<p><b>Edited:</b> A tip for Mac users. I noticed when I double clicked on the zip that my Mac extracted the jar and automatically extracted the contents. Since the CF Admin wants the jar, I wasn't sure what to do. On a whim I went to the command line and found that I could use &quot;unzip&quot;. I simply unzipped the file there and it just extracted the jar.</p>
