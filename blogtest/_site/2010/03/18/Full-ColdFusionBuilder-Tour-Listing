<p>Looks like Adobe finally got a good list up of the cities for the ColdFusion Builder tour:</p>
<p><a href="http://groups.adobe.com/pages/d960e49ab5">CF Builder User Group Events</a></p>
<p>There is a grand total of 81 different cities which is pretty darn intensive if you ask me. Anyone planning on attending?</p>
