<p>I've been doing a lot with ColdFusion 9 and ORM lately and I've run into an interesting little problem. Look at the code block below and see if you can find the error(s):</p>

<p/>
<code>
component persistent="true" table="ARTISTS" {
    property name="id" fieldtype="id";
    property name="firstname" dbtype="string";
    property name="lastname" dbtype="string";
    property name="address" sqltype="string";
    property name="city" sqltype="string";
    property name="state" sqltpye="string";
}
</code>
<p/>
<p>There are three things wrong with this code, but CFBuilder will not flag any of them. Nor will ColdFusion complain when you use the entity. So what's wrong?</p>
<p/>
<p>cfproperty (along with a few other tags) are &quot;magic&quot; within ColdFusion. By magic I mean that they allow you to pass any and all arguments. I could have easily used ray=&quot;fat&quot; to the cfproperty tags and it would compile just as nicely. Normally this isn't such a big deal, but ORM adds something like <b>50(!!)</b> new arguments that have special meaning to cfproperty. With so many new arguments it is easy to make a mistake.</p>
<p/>
<p>The first thing I did wrong above was to use dbtype. ORM lets you specify either a generic database type (ormtype), or a specific type. When I began writing the code above I thought the specific argument was dbtype. But in reality, it is sqltype. My code wouldn't throw an error, and since I was using the default anyway it wouldn't be a huge big deal, but as you can guess, such a mistake could end up with unexpected results.</p>
<p/>
<p>The second issue is more subtle. Notice the typo? I said sqltpye instead of sqltype. Again - this is <b>not</b> something that would throw an error in ColdFusion or be flagged in CFBuilder. So what I did was to create a new extension called ORM Scanner. ORM Scanner will scan all your ORM entities and compare the arguments to your cfproperty tags against the ginormous (that's a technical term) of &quot;accepted&quot; ORM attributes. Given the CFC above, here is the result.</p>

<p>Is this useful? I've attached the extension below. I'll be posting it to RIAForge a bit later today.<p><a href='enclosures/C%3A%5Chosts%5C2009%2Ecoldfusionjedi%2Ecom%5Cenclosures%2FORM%20Scanner%2Ezip'>Download attached file.</a></p></p>
