<p>Two quick updates I want to share with my readers. <a href="http://galleon.riaforge.org">Galleon</a> now includes a private messaging feature. This allows users to send messages to each other. It's pretty simple now, but I'm open to suggestions on how to make it nicer. The second change was a pretty dramatic performance change for large Galleon installs. I hadn't realized how slow Galleon got when the number of messages and threads grew to a large size. This was only evident in the Admin but it was pretty darn bad when it occurred.</p>
<p>The changes to <a href="http://lighthousepro.riaforge.org">LighthousePro</a> were pretty minor. Clicking on the 'view issue' link in emails was not working correctly. Also, if you hit the bug tracker with an expired session, the application wouldn't send you to the proper URL after authentication.</p>
<p>Enjoy. These releases were brought to you by the number 6 and the letter Y.</p>
