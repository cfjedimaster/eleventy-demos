<h1>Post</h1>

<p>So, many, many, <i>many</i> years ago I built a little web app called the <a href="http://www.deathclock.com">Death Clock</a>. I wrote it in Perl (which is what I began my web dev career in) and dropped it on my free university web space and promptly got kicked off in a week when it &quot;spiked&quot; at about 1000 hits per day. (This was back when web counters were big. I can't describe the excitement I got from reloading my page and seeing the little graphical counter - also a Perl script - incrementing by 5-10 hits.) I rewrote the code in pure JavaScript and then - a few years later - rewrote the site in ColdFusion. I sold that web site close to 6 or 7 years ago, but the code behind it is simple - and fun - so I thought I'd share a quick example today.</p>

First off - some background. The idea behind the Death Clock was simple. Based on your birthday, and your gender, you can make a rough <b>guess</b> (and trust me, a <i>lot</i> of people simply didn't get that it was for fun) at when you would die. That by itself isn't that interesting. But I used a bit of code to convert into seconds and then count down from there. Here is a quick example of what I mean. 
<p>
<code>
&lt;cfset bday = createDate(1973,4,8)&gt;
&lt;cfset lifeSpan = 72&gt;
<p>&lt;cfset deathDay = dateAdd(&quot;yyyy&quot;,lifeSpan,bday)&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;cfoutput&gt;
Your day of death is #dateFormat(deathDay, &quot;full&quot;)#.
&lt;p/&gt;
&lt;/cfoutput&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;cfset timeLeft = dateDiff(&quot;s&quot;,now(),deathDay)&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;cfoutput&gt;
You have #numberFormat(timeLeft)# seconds left to live.
&lt;/cfoutput&gt;
</code></p>
<p>
<p>So given a birthday of - today (yep, that's me :) and a lifespan of 72 years (for men, and that's probably not accurate now), we can calculate a &quot;death day&quot; by simply using date add. For me that is Saturday, April 8, 2045, which means I'll be able to get a full week of work in at least before I kick the bucket.</p>
<p>
<p>The next part simply calculates the difference in time - by seconds - between now and then. What's interesting is that back when I first wrote the Death Clock in ColdFusion, the dateDiff function had a small integer maximum. I kept getting the wrong results until I realized it was actually &quot;flipping&quot; over. I switched to getting days and then just multiplied out.</p>
<p>
<p>Of course, I couldn't just leave it at that without adding a bit of jQuery. In this example I've put up two examples, and added some jQuery to grab the values and decrement them. The addCommas function is courtesy of this <a href="http://www.mredkj.com/javascript/numberFormat.html">blog entry</a>.</p>
<p>
<code>
<p>&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1/jquery.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
$(document).ready(function() {
var foundDoms = $(&quot;.numberCounter&quot;)
if(foundDoms.length &gt; 0) setInterval(&quot;updateNumbers()&quot;, 1000)
})</p>
<p>function updateNumbers() {
$(&quot;.numberCounter&quot;).each(function() {
var currentVal = $(this).text()
//remove commas from the #
currentVal = currentVal.replace(/,/g,&quot;&quot;)
if(currentVal &gt; 0) currentVal--
currentVal = addCommas(currentVal)
$(this).text(currentVal)		
})
}</p>
<p>function addCommas(nStr) {
nStr += '';
x = nStr.split('.');
x1 = x[0];
x2 = x.length &gt; 1 ? '.' + x[1] : '';
var rgx = /(\d+)(\d{3})/;
while (rgx.test(x1)) {
x1 = x1.replace(rgx, '$1' + ',' + '$2');
}
return x1 + x2;
}
&lt;/script&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;cfset bday = createDate(1973,4,8)&gt;
&lt;cfset lifeSpan = 72&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;cfset deathDay = dateAdd(&quot;yyyy&quot;,lifeSpan,bday)&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;cfoutput&gt;
Your day of death is #dateFormat(deathDay, &quot;full&quot;)#.
&lt;p/&gt;
&lt;/cfoutput&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;cfset timeLeft = dateDiff(&quot;s&quot;,now(),deathDay)&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;cfoutput&gt;
You have &lt;span class=&quot;numberCounter&quot;&gt;#numberFormat(timeLeft)#&lt;/span&gt; seconds left to live.
&lt;/cfoutput&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;hr/&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;cfset bday = createDate(2010,4,8)&gt;
&lt;cfset lifeSpan = 72&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;cfset deathDay = dateAdd(&quot;yyyy&quot;,lifeSpan,bday)&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;cfoutput&gt;
Your day of death is #dateFormat(deathDay, &quot;full&quot;)#.
&lt;p/&gt;
&lt;/cfoutput&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;cfset timeLeft = dateDiff(&quot;s&quot;,now(),deathDay)&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;cfoutput&gt;
You have &lt;span class=&quot;numberCounter&quot;&gt;#numberFormat(timeLeft)#&lt;/span&gt; seconds left to live.
&lt;/cfoutput&gt;

<p>Completely pointless, I know, but if you want to try it yourself, visit here:</p>

<p>Tweak the URL to enter your own date (and I spent 2 seconds adding validation so I'm sure it can break pretty easily) and sit back. Time is fleeting. ;)</p>
