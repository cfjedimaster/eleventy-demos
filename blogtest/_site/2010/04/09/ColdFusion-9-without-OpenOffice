<p>Daniel emailed me yesterday with the following question:</p>
<blockquote>
I was wondering besides the DOC to PDF conversion, what else is OpenOffice used for in CF9? At my office (gov't site), openoffice may not be approved by our gov't agency to use, and I wanted to figure out what we may lose out on if we don't have it installed?
</blockquote>
<p>So I figured he was dead on about the DOC to PDF support, but I also assumed PPT support for CFPRESENTATION (remember that tag? anyone?) would also be lost. I pinged Adam Lehman though and he said that the <b>only</b> feature you lose is DOC to PDF conversion.</p>
<p>Hopefully this will be of use to folks deciding if they need OpenOffice on their ColdFusion servers.</p>
