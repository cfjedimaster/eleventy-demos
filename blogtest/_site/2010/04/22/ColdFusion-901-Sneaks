<p>Terry Ryan just announced a few tidbits for the upcoming ColdFusion 9.0.1. Don't ask me for details, I'm just sharing the news:</p>
<ul>
<li>ORM support for multiple datasources.
<li>for(x in arr) support - i.e., the ability to do for/in with arrays.
<li>dbinfo() supported in cfscript, along with "others" not yet announced.
<li>And obviously - lots of bug fixes.
</ul>
<p>Looks pretty good!</p>
