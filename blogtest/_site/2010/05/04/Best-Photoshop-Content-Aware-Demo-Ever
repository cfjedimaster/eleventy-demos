<p>Take one broken image:</p>
<img src="https://static.raymondcamden.com/images/test2.jpg" title="You should know why this image is broken." />
<p>And then fix it in Photoshop CS5:</p>

<p>Problem solved. May the Fourth be with you.</p>
<p>p.s. Ok, just to make it clear, I'm a complete and utter Photoshop noob. This could have been done <i>much</i> cleaner. But considering the fact that I did this in 5 minutes as a newbie - I think it says a lot. :)</p>
