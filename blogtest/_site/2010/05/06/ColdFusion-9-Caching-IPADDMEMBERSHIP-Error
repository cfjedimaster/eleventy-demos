<p>I ran into a truly weird error today. I was building a very simple test script to load up my cache system with a lot of crap. This was the script I used:</p>
<p>
<code>
&lt;cfloop index="x" from="1" to="3000"&gt;
       &lt;cfset id = "cache_#x#"&gt;
       &lt;cfset cached = cacheGet(id)&gt;
       &lt;cfif isNull(cached)&gt;
               &lt;cfset value = createUUID() & createUUID() & createUUID() &
repeatString("foo", 250)&gt;
               &lt;cfset cachePut(id, value)&gt;
       &lt;/cfif&gt;
&lt;/cfloop&gt;
</code>
<p>
<p>Nothing crazy there, right? Well upon running this code I immediately got:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>
<b>IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP failed (out of hardware filters?)</b><br/>

<p>I googled - and ran across a few things, but nothing made sense until <a href="http://www.briankotek.com/blog/">Brian Kotek</a> pointed out the following URL:</p>
<p>
<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2534551/error-on-multicastsocket-joingroup">Error on MulticastSocket.joinGroup()</a></p>
<p>
<p>This led to the following Microsoft Tech Note:</p>
<p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/239924">How to disable the Media Sensing feature for TCP/IP in Windows</a></p>
<p>
<p>And that did the trick. This &quot;Media Sense&quot; feature (which by the way impacted my Windows machine but not a coworker) was the culprit. As soon as I did the regedit (wow, it's been a long time since I did one of those) and rebooted, everything worked perfectly.</p>
