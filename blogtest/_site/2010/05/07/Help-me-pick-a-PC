<p>I'm upgrading my desktop soon (a MacPro from close to 3 years ago) and I'm going to switch to PC. I won't go into why - and I'll be the first to admit I might go right back (or switch to Ubuntu), but I'd like to get some opinions on the two systems below. The HP has more bling and is cheaper. But I was a Dell customer for a <i>long</i> time and their support kicks butt. I can remember every hardware issue I had being corrected - in person - within 48 hours or so. So I'm tempted to do Dell even though the system is a bit pricier and doesn't have the BluRay or 2TB drive. Anyway, I'm sure everyone will have one opinion only and will make this easy for me.</p>
<p>First the Dell...</p>

<p>And then the HP...</p>

<p>The price for the HP is 2498.</p>
