<p>Just helping to spread the word. Dan Vega created a Google Group specifically for ColdFusion Builder Extension development. You can find it here: <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/cfb-extensions-dev">http://groups.google.com/group/cfb-extensions-dev</a> Currently it is set so that non-members can't read - I'm going to bug Dan about that.</p>
