<p>Looks like I'm the last one to blog (my fault for actually trying to sleep last night ;) that the first update to ColdFusion Builder has been released. This <a href="http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/846/cpsid_84607.html">note</a> describes how and what is it fixed. Probably the number one thing corrected is the &quot;long horizontal line&quot; issue. If you had any code that was <i>real</i> long and you tried to type at the end, CFB would &quot;flip&quot; back and forth. It drove me batty and I'm happy to see it corrected. Another nice fix involves an issue I ran into all the time with JavaScript and Code Assist. Anyway, if you are a CFBuilder user, update now!</p>
