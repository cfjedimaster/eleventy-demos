<p>Terry Ryan just gave his keynote at Scotch on the Rocks (and folks, I should say, my net access has been limited, so please forgive me if I'm slow to blog/tweet/respond). He showed some pretty cool demos - but at the end also gave us two new bits of information about upcoming (Second Half 2010) release of ColdFusion 9.0.1.</p>
<p>The first new feature is Amazon S3 support. I didn't have time to copy down the code he showed on the slide, but I'll say it looks as as simple as can be, which is awesome since S3 is a great way to handle media files. <a href="http://groups.adobe.com">Adobe Groups</a> makes use of S3 via a CFC, but I'll soon update it to to work with the native support.</p>
<p>The other feature was the ability to write HQL in cfquery tags. This can be real useful complex dynamic queries. Again, I can't really share any code, but just imagine HQL within a cfquery tag and you get the idea.</p>
