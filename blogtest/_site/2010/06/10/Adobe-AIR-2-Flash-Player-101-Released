<p>The title says it all. Adobe AIR 2 (2.0.2) and Flash Player 10.1 have been released. Adobe AIR 2 adds some kick butt new features, all of which have been discussed before, so I'm just going to share the links for now.</p>
<p>Adobe AIR 2 download: <a href="http://get.adobe.com/air/">http://get.adobe.com/air/</a><br/>
Flash Player 10.1 download: <a href="http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/">http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/</a></p>
<p>It looks like the home page for AIR is still calling 2 the release candidate - so things may be in process of being updated.</p>
