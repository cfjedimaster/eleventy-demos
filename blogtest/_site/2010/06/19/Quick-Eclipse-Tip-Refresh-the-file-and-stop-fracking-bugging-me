<p>Ok, I love the Eclipse platform, but it has a few... eccentricities that annoy the heck out of me. One of them involves how uppity Eclipse gets if a file is modified by another process. Instead of simply refreshing the file, Eclipse will give you a snooty message and demand you refresh the file. I complained about this on Twitter (is there any other reason to use Twitter) and <a href="http://stevegood.org/">Steve Good</a> let me know that you can set Eclipse to automatically refresh. Turns out he was exactly right:</p>

<p>Woot. A few notes. First - in my testing, this did not pick up new folders. It did pick up new files in the folders. Secondly - if you have a file open and it's modified, you will not lose the file. In other words, you still get the normal &quot;This file was modified - do you want to load&quot; message. That's a good thing of course. What you <i>won't</i> get is a complaint if you open the file after it was modified by something else.</p>
<p>
<p>Anyway - hope this helps other and thanks Steve!</p>
