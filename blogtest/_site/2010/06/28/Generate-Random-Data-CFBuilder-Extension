<p>I just released (at RIAForge naturally: <a href="http://randomdatagenerator.riaforge.org/">http://randomdatagenerator.riaforge.org/</a>) a new ColdFusion Builder Extension: Generate Random Data. The idea behind the extension is simple. Many times I have need of a ColdFusion query, but don't have the actual data itself. I may be building a service component, or perhaps writing a simple test for a blog entry. I typically do something like so:</p>
<p/>

<code>
&lt;cfset q = queryNew("id,name")&gt;
&lt;cfloop index="x" from="1" to="10"&gt;
  &lt;cfset queryAddRow(q)&gt;
  &lt;cfset querySetCell(q, "id", x)&gt;
  &lt;cfset querySetCell(q, "name", "Random X")&gt;
&lt;/cfloop&gt;
</code>
<p>
<p>And while this &quot;works&quot;, I had a hunch ColdFusion Builder would allow me to do it even quicker. With that idea in mind, I quickly whipped up the following extension. Click the image below to watch a quick video:</p>

<p>
<p>The extension makes use of both jQuery and the jQuery Validation library. Right now it's pretty simple. You can generate queries with random names, random numbers, random values from a list, and random booleans. If folks have ideas on how to extend this, just file an enhancement request at the RIAForge project.</p>
<p>
<p>So.... useful?</p>
