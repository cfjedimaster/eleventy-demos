<p>Let's be honest. The most important aspect of a conference isn't
location, speakers, sessions, or dare I say it, food, but rather the
t-shirt you go home with. This year <a href="http://www.cfunited.com">CFUNITED</a> is looking to the
community for help in designing the 2010 conference tee shirt. All you
need to do is come up with a snazzy, funny, coy, etc bit of CFML code
to put on the front of the shirt. As an example, a few years back a
company produced a set of beer glasses with some &lt;cf_beer&gt; code
printed on it. Your code should be similar. Remember it has to fit on
the front of a shirt so keep it short and sweet.</p>
<p>There will be a first, second, and third place winner. The first place
winner will get 50% off their ticket to CFUNITED and their code
printed on the official conference tee shirt. The second and third
place winner will both get $200 off the ticket price.</p>
<p>To enter, simply post your entry as a comment below. I'll be picking
winners Friday at the end of business.</p>
<p>As a reminder, CFUNITED is coming soon. You have 28 days left to
register. Myself, and many other community members, will be speaking
on a variety of topics. <a href="http://register.cfunited.com/">Register now!</a></p>
