<p>I'm working on my presentation for CFUN which involves jQuery and HTML based AIR applications. (Oh, and ColdFusion too. :) I was working on a sample application that made use of SQLite to create a simple Note application. (If this sounds familiar, it is based on the Flex application I did for my <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2010/6/11/Recording-and-Slides-from-SQLite-presentation">cfObjective SQLite presentation</a>.) Here is the code I tried to insert a new note record into my database.</p>
<p>
<code>
var sqlstatement = new air.SQLStatement()
sqlstatement.sqlConnection = connection
var sql = 
	"insert into notes(title, body,created)"+
	"values(:title,:body,:created)";
<p>sqlstatement.text = sql
sqlstatement.parameters[&quot;:title&quot;] = title;
sqlstatement.parameters[&quot;:body&quot;] = body;
sqlstatement.parameters[&quot;:created&quot;] = new Date();</p>
<p>sqlstatement.addEventListener(air.SQLEvent.RESULT,contentChange);
sqlstatement.execute();
</code></p>
<p>
<p>There isn't anything too crazy here. I have three columns. The first two are just strings. The third is a date. When I run this, something odd happens. When I displayed the results in a table, I got [object Object] for my created values. I thought at first that AIR was being slick and recognizing a valid JavaScript date object. I tried running .getMonths() on it and got an error that it wasn't a support method. What the heck? So I switched to Lita, an application (also AIR based!) that let's you run ad hoc queries against SQLite databases. Surprisingly, even there, the values were [object Object]!</p>
<p>
<p>For the heck of it, I then tried using toString() on the JavaScript date object. Here's where things got weird. I got an immediate SQL error saying that my value wasn't a date. So SQLite/AIR recognized Date() as a valid date value, but stored it (from what I could see) incorrectly. Yet when I tried a string representation, it failed. I ended up figuring out the format SQLite wanted. It's pretty pick. If your month or date has one digit you have to prepend it with 0. I wrote this little function to do it for me:</p>
<p>
<code>
<p>//given a date, return it so I can insert it
function dbDateTimeFormat(dt) {
//i had fancy trenarys here - went for simple
var month = dt.getMonth()+1;
if(month &lt; 10) month = &quot;0&quot; + month;
var day = dt.getDate();
if(day &lt; 10) day = &quot;0&quot; + day;
var dStr = dt.getFullYear() + &quot;-&quot; + month + &quot;-&quot; + day;
var hour = dt.getHours();
if(hour &lt; 10) hour = &quot;0&quot; + hour;
var minute = dt.getMinutes();
if(minute &lt; 10) minute = &quot;0&quot; + minute;
var second = dt.getSeconds();
if(second &lt; 10) second = &quot;0&quot; + second;
dStr += ' ' + hour + ':' + minute + ':' + second
air.trace(dStr);
return dStr;
}
</code></p>
<p>
<p>Obviously this would be a lot slimmer if I used some ternary functions for my month/day parsing, but when I write code, I try to start off as simple as possible.</p>
<p>
<p>So... someone please tell me I'm wrong. I've got to believe that there is a simple way to do this. Anyone?</p>
