We've got some big things planned and I think it's going to be great. We are pretty close to announcing our session and speaker list. I think our line is incredible and it includes easily the best presenters in our community. If you have not yet decided if you want to attend MAX this year, I'm hoping the following will convince you. You can use this code: <b>CFUG500</b> to get a discounted MAX ticket of $1095. That's 200 bucks off the price now, and 400 off on August 16th when the price rolls up.</p>
