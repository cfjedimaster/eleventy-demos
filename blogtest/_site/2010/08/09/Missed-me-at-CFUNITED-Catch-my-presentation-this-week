<p>On Thursday of this week, I'll be giving my CFUNITED presentation, <b>AIR Development with jQuery and ColdFusion</b> to the ColdFusion Online Meetup. The time is 12PM EST and it will be recorded. The presentation discusses HTML development for the Adobe AIR platform with sometime spent on how jQuery and ColdFusion helps in the process. (But to be clear, this presentation is 95% client side AIR/JavaScript.) For details, and to RSVP (remember, if 100+ RSVP and show up, I do the presentation in &quot;Barbershop Quarter&quot; style), visit the Online Meetup: <a href="http://www.meetup.com/coldfusionmeetup/calendar/14365311/">http://www.meetup.com/coldfusionmeetup/calendar/14365311/</a></p>
