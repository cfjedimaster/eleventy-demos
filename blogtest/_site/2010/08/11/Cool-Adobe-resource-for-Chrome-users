<p>Nathan Stanford II sent me a link to a cool resource he released for Chrome: <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/dehobnjngonejggmglbbfmdokhdaifeb">Adobe Community Helper</a>. If you use Chrome, installing the extension will add a new icon to top of your browser:</p>

<p>You can then click this icon and enter a search term:</p>

<p>Once you hit enter, it will then perform a search on the Adobe Community Help. So for example, here is where I was sent to after a search for coldfusion: <a href="http://community.adobe.com/help/search.html?q=coldfusion&hl=en_US&self=0&area=0&lbl=0">http://community.adobe.com/help/search.html?q=coldfusion&amp;hl=en_US&amp;self=0&amp;area=0&amp;lbl=0</a></p>
