<h1>Post</h1>

<p>Just a quick note to point out Russ Johnson's blog post on a fund raising drive he is doing for MS: <a href="http://angry-fly.com/post.cfm/win-a-copy-of-cfbuilder">Win a copy of CFBuilder</a>. The basic gist is - you make a small donation to sponsor his bike ride and you are entered into a chance to win a copy of CFBuilder (graciously provided by Adobe). This is a great cause and I hope more than a few of my readers out there participate (I just donated a bit myself).</p>
