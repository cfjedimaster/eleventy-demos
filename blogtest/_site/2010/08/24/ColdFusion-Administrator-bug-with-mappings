<p>Watch out for this one - I almost didn't notice it. Today I went to add a new mapping. It just so happened that the mapping I added was one that already existed. The administrator correctly noticed this and gave me an error:</p>

<p>No big deal, right? I'll just rename mine to /org2 and hit submit.</p>

<p>Ouch. It actually replaced my org mapping. Not the end of the world, but if you had a lot of mappings it could easily be missed. Note - I recommend - almost always - that you use Application specific mappings. In my case though it is a code base I can't modify just yet.</p>
<p>I have filed a bug report for this, but unfortunately the <a href="http://cfbugs.adobe.com/cfbugreport/flexbugui/cfbugtracker/main.html">public bug base</a> still hides 901 bugs.</p>
