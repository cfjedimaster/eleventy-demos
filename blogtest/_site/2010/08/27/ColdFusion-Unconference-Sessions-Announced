<p>So this was actually announced quite a bit earlier on Twitter, but as I've been bug hunting all day I didn't get a chance to blog about it till now. You can now find the official list of sessions and speakers for the ColdFusion Unconference here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/page.cfm/ColdFusion-Unconference">ColdFusion Unconference</a></p>
<p>I've actually purchased a nicer domain name but haven't yet hooked it up. Ignoring that though - check out the list of speakers and sessions. This is a fracking <b>rock star</b> set of content if I may be so bold. (Yes, I will be.)</p>
<p>I will also remind people that you can attend MAX for the low cost of 200 dollars. Yes, 200 bucks. That gives you that &quot;Exhibits-only&quot; pass which allows you access to all 4 Unconferences. (Yes, there are 3 other ones as well. But all the cool kids will be at the ColdFusion one.) I think it's worthwhile to go for the full MAX experience but if you are on a limited budget, this is definitely a great option.</p>
<p>I've only one thing left to say:</p>

<p>Big thanks to all the speakers who agreed to participate as well as Ezra Parker and Charlie Griefer for once again being co-managers of this event.</p>
