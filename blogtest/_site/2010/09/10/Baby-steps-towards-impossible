<p>Ok, so I don't often get philosophical here - I'm not that kind of guy - but I heard something pretty important a few days ago at the last Google keynote that I wanted to share with my readers. It had a huge impact on me when I heard it and I hope I can do a good job of conveying what I felt then.</p>
<p>The speaker (and I apologize for not remembering his name), was talking about how when they initially dreamed up the idea of Google Instant, the engineers all said it was impossible. Now - as a developer - I know I've run into a few <i>really</i> impossible requests from clients in the past. I'm sure I'm not alone in this. But really got me was what happened next.</p>
<p>Even though the engineers were certain it was not possible, they chewed on it. Then one of them figured out a way to get about 5% of the way to what Google Instant needed. Sure the final goal was still impossible, but here was a way to do a small part of it.</p>
<p>And this is where things got interesting. Another engineer found another 5% improvement. And then another one. And so on. Eventually they made it to the &quot;Impossible&quot; goal.</p>
<p>I know the idea of breaking down a huge goal into smaller, more easily reachable tasks is certainly not new - but I loved hearing how despite the assurance that it wasn't going to be possible - they went for it anyway.</p>
<p>It's something I'm going to keep in mind and I hope you will as well.</p>
