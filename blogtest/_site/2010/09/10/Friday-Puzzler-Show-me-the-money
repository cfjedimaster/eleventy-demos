Their problem was: Given 1000 dollars and 1% interest every day - now long until you double your money. Since ColdFusion makes everything simpler, I'm going to make this a bit more complex. Your challenge is to write a generic UDF that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Takes in an initial balance
<li>Takes in a percentage interest value
<li>Takes in a desired total
</ul>
<p>Given the parameters above, your UDF will return how many days it takes to go from the initial balance to the total. If you want - just write the UDF. If you're bored - write a program that will chart out the balance growth every day.</p>
<p>Want some incentive? The best entry will get a 20 dollar gift certificate. &quot;Best&quot; will be 100% subjective and probably unfair.</p>
