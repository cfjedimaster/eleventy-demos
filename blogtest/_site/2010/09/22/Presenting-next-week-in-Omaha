<p>Next week I'll be presenting to the <a href="http://necfug.com/">Nebraska ColdFusion User Group</a>. I'll be there for their Tuesday, September 28th meeting. I'll be giving a preview of my MAX session. This is a high level session discussing things that developers <i>should</i> be doing - but too few of us actually are. Anyway, if you are in Omaha and have nothing else better to do, come say hi!</p>
