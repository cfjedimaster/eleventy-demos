A minor update, but if fixes some small annoying issues, including cleaning up the email and helping preserve your message entry if your session times out while writing a post.</p>
<p/>
<p>For anyone not aware - Galleon is an open source, free ColdFusion-based forum solution. It provides all your normal forum-type features as well as plenty of extra cowbell on top.</p>
