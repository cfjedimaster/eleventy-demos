<p>A big thank you to Jason Dean and Andy Matthews for creating a Google group just for HTML/Adobe AIR Developers: <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/air-html-js">AIR with HTML and JavaScript</a>. In only one day there have been some great posts already so I definitely recommend signing up.</p>
