<p>I was having a discussion with a reader this week when the topic of high profile, high traffic ColdFusion sites came up. I discussed this with others and gathered up their recommendations into the following list of sites that - most likely - even your non-techy friends would recognize. This isn't meant to be any type of exhaustive list or the &quot;best&quot; ColdFusion sites - but just the ones most likely to be recognized by the general public.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.bankofamerica.com">Bank of America</a>
<li><a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com">Mayo Clinic</a>
<li><a href="http://www.senate.gov">U.S. Senate</a>
<li><a href="http://www.usmint.gov">U.S. Mint</a>
<li><a href="http://www.usbank.com">U.S. Bank</a>
<li><a href="http://jkrowling.com">J.K. Rowling Official Site</a>
<li><a href="http://www.adobe.com">Adobe (just tell your non-tech friends - the Flash/PDF people)</a>
</ul>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>
