I know the site isn't the best to find stuff at times, but there are a wealth of resources there. Today I was reminded of the <a href="http://forums.adobe.com/community/coldfusion">ColdFusion Forums</a> hosted there. The forums are pretty broad (with <b>11</b> subtopics) and get a bit of traffic.</p>
<p>I knew about these forums for a while but I tended to forget about them. Brian Kotek reminded me today that they <b>support email notifications</b> if you go into one of the sub topics. Simply click the &quot;Receive email notifications&quot; link (after logging in of course) and you can both get emails and reply to them via your email client.</p>
