<p>Earlier today I was looking at some HTML that was generated by ColdFusion. The HTML was simply a list of months and years where content existed in the database. Because the database was a bit old, the list was quite long. I wondered if I could use jQuery to create an automatic shortening of the list as well as creating a way to expand the list based on some user interface. Here is what I came up with.</p>
<!--more-->
<p/>
<p>First, let's create a long list from ColdFusion:</p>
<p/>
<code>
&lt;ul id="list"&gt;
&lt;cfloop index="x" from="1" to="25"&gt;
	&lt;cfoutput&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Item #x#&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/cfoutput&gt;
&lt;/cfloop&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code>
<p/>
<p>And the result display is - as you expect - quite large:</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<p>Ok, so next I loaded up jQuery and added a document.ready block:</p>
<p/>
<code>
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1/jquery.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
$(document).ready(function() {
<p>});
</code></p>
<p/>
<p>I began by selecting my UL:</p>
<p/>
<code>
//get the item
var item = $("#list");
</code>
<p/>
<p>Next I got the kids and checked to see if there were more than 10:</p>
<p/>
<code>
//get the children
var kids = item.children();
<p>if(kids.length &gt; 10) {
</code></p>
<p/>
<p>At this point we need to do 3 things. First, hide kids 11 through - whatever. Secondly add a link to let the user see the rest of the list. Finally - listen for a click on that link so we can actually show the items. Here is the first block:</p>
<p/>
<code>
for(var i=10; i&lt;kids.length; i++) {
	$(kids[i]).hide();
}
</code>
<p/>
<p>I could do that on one line, but I don't really see much benefit in that. I could also write this other ways. jQuery has a nice each() function that will iterate over stuff. But since I only want to go from 11-N, this seemed better to me.</p>
<p/>
<code>
item.append("&lt;a href='' class='showMoreLink'&gt;Show More&lt;/a&gt;");
</code>
<p/>
<p>This - obviously - adds the link. Note the use of append. This will actually put the text in the same 'tab' as the rest of the list. I could have used after() but I kinda like how 'Show More' lined up.</p>
<p/>
<code>
$(".showMoreLink", item).click(function(e) {
	item.children().show()
	$(this).hide();
	e.preventDefault();
});
</code>
<p/>
<p>And that is the final block. Note the use of item within the jQuery selector. This means that if I repeated this code multiple times then the event listener will only respond to the one of this particular list. I end up showing all the children which is a bit wasteful, but that syntax was too easy to pass up. I then hide the link. That means the list can be opened, but not closed. That seemed ok to me as I can't imagine wanting to toggle it back and forth - but I may come back to that. Finally I prevent the default click action. So how does it work? Here is the display:</p>
<p/>
<img src="https://static.raymondcamden.com/images/cfjedi/screen11.png" />
<p/>
<p>And it works! You can click the big ole Demo button below to see. It also works fine with other types of parent/child relationships:</p>
<p/>
<code>
&lt;div id="list2"&gt;
&lt;cfloop index="x" from="1" to="25"&gt;
	&lt;cfoutput&gt;
		&lt;div&gt;Item #x#&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/cfoutput&gt;
&lt;/cfloop&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code>
<p/>
<p>But it did not work well with tables at all. Again, I'll come back to it. So - this works - but is pretty simplistic. In the next blog entry I'll convert this to a plugin so I can simply do: $(&quot;#list&quot;).autoShorten() while allowing for optional values for the number of items to show and what to use for the link text.</p>

<code>
<p>&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1/jquery.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
$(document).ready(function() {</p>
<pre><code>//get the item
var item = $(&quot;#list&quot;);

//get the children
var kids = item.children();
console.log(kids.length);
if(kids.length &amp;gt; 10) {

	for(var i=10; i&amp;lt;kids.length; i++) {
		$(kids[i]).hide();
	}
	
	item.append(&quot;&amp;lt;a href='' class='showMoreLink'&amp;gt;Show More&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&quot;);
	
	$(&quot;.showMoreLink&quot;, item).click(function(e) {
		item.children().show()
		$(this).hide();
		e.preventDefault();
	});
	
}	
</code></pre>
<p>})
&lt;/script&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;ul id=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
&lt;cfloop index=&quot;x&quot; from=&quot;1&quot; to=&quot;25&quot;&gt;
&lt;cfoutput&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Item #x#&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/cfoutput&gt;
&lt;/cfloop&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></p>
