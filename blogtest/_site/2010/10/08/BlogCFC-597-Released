<h1>Post</h1>

<p>So I normally post my BlogCFC related stuff to it's own <a href="http://news.blogcfc.com">blog</a>, but I'm just too darn excited about this release to keep it there. I'll be posting this entry there as well so folks who subscribe to both - please forgive me. This is a huge release of the blogware and has some awesome new features that I'm extremely proud of. Of course - there were all submitted by the community of BlogCFC Users so thanks go to them. So what's new?</p>
<p>First off, Dave Ferguson contributed a mobile version of BlogCFC. You can see it now it you hit my blog with a mobile device. It makes use of the <a href="http://jqtouch.com">jqTouch</a> framework and I think it works pretty darn nice.</p>
<p>Next, Jason Delmore updated the look of the admin. While the functionality isn't changed (except for some usability tweaks Jason added on the settings page), it just looks a heck of a lot nicer and gives the blog a newer feel I think.</p>
<p>Speaking of Jason, he also updated the email templates BlogCFC sends out to subscribers. It uses HTML now and includes the gravatar pictures. I currently use <a href="http://gist.com">Gist</a> for GMail and it's amazing how much a picture (shoot, even a generic picture) adds to an email.</p>
<p>Lastly - Rob Brooks-Bilson took a stab at updating some of the &quot;Monster&quot; CFC that is at the core of BlogCFC. He helped clean it up and added a new pod as well.</p>
<p>You can can <a href="http://blogcfc.riaforge.org/index.cfm?event=page.projectscreenshots">screen shots</a> of this now over at RIAForge and can download the bits now. Enjoy!</p>
<p>(Oh, and I've got plans for 5.9.8 already!)</p>
