<p>Last night I was honored to give a presentation to the Capital Area CFUG. My presentation was a preview of my MAX topic, &quot;Best Practices of the Modern CF Developer.&quot; During the presentation the topic of Trusted Cache came up and I was truly surprised to hear that next to no one was using this in production.</p>
<p>While certainly not a silver bullet for performance issues, turning on the Trusted Cache (see screen shot below) can sometimes dramatically increase the performance of your site in <b>the one second it takes for you to check a box</b>. That's a huge win for little to no work on your part.</p>

<p>Seriously - go to your production site, hit that box, and tell me if you don't see your site running significantly faster afterwards. There is no XML involved. No Server restart. Just a checkbox.</p>
<p>Now - there is one small drawback. After you've done this, ColdFusion will no longer look at your CFML pages for changes. In order to tell ColdFusion to check a file again, you either have to a) hit the button below:</p>

<p>or b) make use of <a href="http://cacheclearer.riaforge.org/">CacheClearer</a>, a ColdFusion Admin extension that let's you specifically request a file or folder to be cleared.</p>
<p>So... why <i>aren't</i> more of you using this?</p>
