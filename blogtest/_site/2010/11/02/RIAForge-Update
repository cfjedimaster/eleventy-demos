<p>Just a quick note for <a href="http://www.riaforge.org">RIAForge</a> users. When searching, projects that have not been updated in over 180 days will be &quot;dimmed&quot;. This is not meant to prevent users from clicking on them (you definitely still can), but rather to highlight projects that are more active. If your curious, I simply added an &quot;old&quot; class to them when printing out the results loaded via AJAX and used this CSS for opacity:</p>
<code>
.old {
	opacity:0.3;filter:alpha(opacity=30);
}
</code>}
