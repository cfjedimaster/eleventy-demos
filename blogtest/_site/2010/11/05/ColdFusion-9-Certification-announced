<p>Ok, so I know I said I'd <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2008/7/2/My-last-post-on-Adobe-Certification">never talk</a> about certification again - but - with some distance between now and the &quot;history&quot; I've had with certification, I figure I can give it another shot. Also, I figure folks may want to know. So if you are interested in getting certified for ColdFusion 9, you can now do so. The ADC Blog has the details here: <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/adc/2010/11/coldfusion-9-certification-exam-now-available.html">ColdFusion 9 certification exam now available</a></p>
<p>You can also take a look at the <a href="http://bit.ly/aVHMA1">prep guide</a> (PDF) which includes a few sample questions.</p>
