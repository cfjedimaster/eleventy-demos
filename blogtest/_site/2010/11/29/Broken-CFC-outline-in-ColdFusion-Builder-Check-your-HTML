<p>From time to time I'll encounter a CFC that is 'broken' in the outline. By broken I mean the method listing goes up to a certain point and just plain stops. I don't encounter this very often, but when I do, it's normally a case of needing to find some method <i>after</i> the mysterious stopping point. I brought this up with Adobe, and used a specific file as an example, and today Ramchandra (Adobe engineer) shared with me what the issue was - invalid HTML.</p>

<p>Let's look at an example of this. The following CFC closely resembles the one that originally had a broken outline.</p>
<p/>
<code>
&lt;cfcomponent&gt;
<pre><code>&amp;lt;cffunction name=&quot;badboy&quot;&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;cfset var str = &quot;&quot;&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;cfsavecontent variable=&quot;str&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/cfsavecontent&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;cfreturn str&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/cffunction&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;cffunction name=&quot;goodboy&quot;&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;cfreturn &quot;&amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;&quot;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/cffunction&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;cffunction name=&quot;placeholder1&quot;&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;cfreturn 1&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/cffunction&amp;gt;
</code></pre>
<p>&lt;/cfcomponent&gt;
</code></p>
<p/>
<p>Notice the very first method, badboy, returns a TR tag. This is perfectly valid CFML. You could imagine a real use for this - perhaps in a method called startTableRow. And yea - this would be <b>way over enginered</b> - but I've bet we've all seen code like that before. Check out what the outline does with it though:</p>

<p>As you can see, it stops at badboy and doesn't render anything past that. If we comment out badboy we get:</p>

<p>Now - in the code above - there is really no bug. In my original CFC shared with Adobe there definitely was. (This is in <a href="http://galleon.riaforge.org">Galleon</a> and will be fixed today.) I've made the argument that the code above should <i>not</i> break the outline. That being said though - if you have outline issues - check for something like this.</p>
<p/>
<p>On a related note, I've noticed that CFBuilder will not correctly flag invalid HTML. Create a new HTML file in CFBuilder, write a B tag and don't close it, and you get no error or warning. Do the same in Aptana. I've asked about why this happens and if I find out I'll post back.</p>
