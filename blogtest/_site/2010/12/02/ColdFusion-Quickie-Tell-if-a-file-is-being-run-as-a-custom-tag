<p>This just came in via Twitter so I thought I'd share the tip here. @orangeexception asked how you could tell if a file was being run as a custom tag. One quick and dirty way to do this is to just check for the existence of the ThisScope scope:</p>
<p>
<code>
&lt;cfif structKeyExists(variables, "ThisTag")&gt;
custom tag
&lt;cfelse&gt;
not a custom tag
&lt;/cfif&gt;
</code>
<p/>
<p>I've never bothered to do this with a custom tag, but I can see how it could help enforce folks using your tags in the right way.</p>
