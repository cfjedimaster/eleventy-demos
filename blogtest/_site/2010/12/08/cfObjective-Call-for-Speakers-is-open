<p>This isn't exactly new, but the call for speakers for cfObjective 2011 is now open - just hit up the cool little site here: <a href="http://engage.cfobjective.com/index.cfm/main/">http://engage.cfobjective.com/index.cfm/main/</a>. Note that you can continue to submit topics as well. cfObjective will be May 12-14 in lovely, never-freezing cold, Minneapolis, MN.</p>
