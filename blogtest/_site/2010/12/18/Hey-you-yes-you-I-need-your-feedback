<h1>Post</h1>

<p>Hey readers - it's the end of the year (well, kinda), and I'm looking for feedback on my blog. This is not feedback on me. I know I'm perfect. (Ok, maybe <i>slightly</i> less than perfect.) What I'm looking for is for folks to provide me some ideas on how ColdFusionJedi.com can be more beneficial to you. My goal with this site is to help others along with helping myself. Many times the things I explore here are my own way of coming to grip with some particularly complex concept. Writing about it, simplifying and explaining it on my blog, helps me firm up the ideas in my own head and I hope it helps others as well.</p>
<p>The content of this blog has evolved over the past 7 years. That's a good thing. But I also want to ensure I'm meeting the needs of my readers as much as possible.</p>
<p>I decided to use Google Docs for a simple survey. Why not <a href="http://soundings.riaforge.org">Soundings</a>? No reason. I'm a firm believer in eating your own dog food, but I've been wanting to try a survey on Google Docs for some time now and I figured this was a good opportunity to do so.</p>
<p>I know you guys have opinions. You do a great job of expressing them here. So please take a few minutes and answer the survey questions here:</p>

<p>Thank you! And yes - the Christmas theme on the survey is completely unnecessary.</p>
