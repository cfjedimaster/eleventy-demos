<h1>Post</h1>

<p>So I've tweeted about this a few times this weekend but just as an FYI, <a href="http://www.riaforge.org">RIAForge</a> has moved to a new server. Basic web pages are running fine. SVN is not working yet. Here is what I'm seeing - and if anyone has an idea, let me know.</p>
<p>
Before the move, a request of svn.riaforge.org/YYY (where YYY was a project using SVN), would return the files in Subversion. This is because read access was always allowed on SVN repos at RIAForge. Now it's returning permission denied. 
<p>
Any clues as to what I should check first? Here is an example config:
<p>
<code>
&lt;Location /blogcfc&gt;
	DAV svn
	SVNPath c:\apath\blogcfc
<pre><code># initialize basic http authentication
AuthType Basic
AuthName &quot;Subversion repository&quot;
AuthUserFile c:\apatch\blogcfc\conf\htpasswd

# require authentication
&amp;lt;LimitExcept GET PROPFIND OPTIONS REPORT&amp;gt;
	Require valid-user
&amp;lt;/LimitExcept&amp;gt;	
</code></pre>
<p>&lt;/Location&gt;
</code></p>
<p>
I've confirmed the paths are right (I did obscure it above). I'm sure there is more info I can share - but I'm not sure what.}
