<p>So I run the latest and greatest dev version of Chrome (currently 10.0.634.0) so I expect a few... irregularities from time to time. But this one threw me for a loop. I was testing some code on my local server (see <a href="http://www.stephenwithington.com/blog/index.cfm/2011/1/13/Beware-of-Implicit-Structs-Bug-in-ColdFusion-901">this blog post</a> if you are curious about the bug) and ColdFusion was throwing errors left and right. I expected this. But after about 5 reloads all of a sudden I got:</p>

<p>Read that carefully. Chrome decided to prevent me from &quot;making the situation worse&quot; and prevented me from hitting the site. If I waited a few seconds then I was &quot;allowed&quot; to run the page again. Now luckily the message is very clear on how to get around this. But I wanted to throw this out to my audience in case they run into it, or in case they run into clients reporting it.</p>
<p>Personally I think this is a huge mistake. I get what they are trying to do here but I can see this backfiring in a big way. You would think it would be smart enough to at least skip the check for localhost.</p>
