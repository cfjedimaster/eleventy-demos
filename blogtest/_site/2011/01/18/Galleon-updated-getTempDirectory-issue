<p>A <a href="http://galleon.riaforge.org">Galleon</a> user reported an odd issue when he moved his forums to a new host. All of a sudden attachment uploads stopped working. I did some debugging with him and it turned out that ColdFusion's getTempDirectory function was returning a blank value! Turns out this <i>has</i> happened to a few others, and Ben Nadel documents his run in with it <a href="http://www.bennadel.com/blog/1096-ColdFusion-GetTempDirectory-Stops-Working.htm">here</a>. I updated Galleon to default to using getTempDirectory for uploads but to allow for a specific folder in the settings file. I'll also be updating other apps in the future with a similar workaround.</p>
