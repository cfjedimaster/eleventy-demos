<p>This just went live over on <a href="http://www.cfpanel.com">ColdFusion Panel</a> - the next panel discussion has been announced: <a href="http://cfpanel.com/index.cfm/2011/1/18/Episode-6--Why-Server-Side-Developers-Should-Consider-jQuery">Why Server Side Developers Should Consider jQuery</a> . The panel will consist of Rey Bango and Doug Neiner, both heavily related to the jQuery world, along with myself and Ben Nadel, both ColdFusion developers who have embraced jQuery quite heavily. It will be held on February 8th at 12PM EST. Hope to see you there!</p>
