<p>Today I pushed a new feature to <a href="http://www.riaforge.org">RIAForge</a>. Project owners have a new property called &quot;Last Update&quot;. This allows them to specify what has changed with their projects. Now when you view the RIAForge home page or a project page, you can get a description of what  the latest changes to the project contain. Those of you subscribed to the daily email (which I forgot to setup when moving servers - sorry!) will also get this information.</p>
