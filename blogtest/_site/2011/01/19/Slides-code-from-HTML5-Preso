<h1>Post</h1>

<p>Ok, so I know most of my readers are probably saying to themselves, <i>&quot;What HTML5 preso?&quot;</i>. Last night I presented to my local <a href="http://www.acadiana-aug.org/">Adobe User Group</a> on HTML5. This was a brand new topic for me and one I hope I did a decent enough job on. I mean, it's not like HTML5 is confusing or anything. Any way, for the folks at the meeting last night I promised I'd post the slides and code. For everyone else, if there is interest in me giving this online, leave me a comment. I'll either suggest it to Charlie for the online meetup or just throw open a Connect room this week. To be honest, I'd rather <i>not</i> do it on Charlie's Online Meetup because I'm worried it is a bit too rough still. Then again I tend to be pretty hypercritical about my presenting so I may just need to shut the frak up and get over it. ;)<p><a href='enclosures/C%3A%5Chosts%5C2009%2Ecoldfusionjedi%2Ecom%5Cenclosures%2Fintrotohtml5%2Ezip'>Download attached file.</a></p></p>
