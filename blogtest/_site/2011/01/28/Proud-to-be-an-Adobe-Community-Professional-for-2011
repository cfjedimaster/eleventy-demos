<h1>Post</h1>

<p>I tweeted this last night but since there are still a few people out there not on Twitter (and actually getting work done) I thought I'd share my good news. I found out last night I was re-selected for the Adobe Community Professional program for 2011. You can find the full list of the group members <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/community/2011/01/adobe-community-professionals-2011.html">here</a>. Adobe has also expanded their community programs by adding an entirely <i>new</i> group of folks called <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/community/2011/01/adobe-community-champions-2011.html">Adobe Community Champions</a>. I see many familiar names there! You can find out more about the new group <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/community/2011/01/adobe-community-champions-program-launch.html">here</a> as well as how it differs from the Community Professional program. Congrats to <b>everyone</b> recognized. I'm quite proud of my &quot;unofficial&quot; evangelism role for Adobe. I've made it no secret I'm a fan boy - although I do try my best to be fair and impartial. I'd hope my readers would call me out if I ever slip up in that regard.</p>
