<p>Did you know there was a Google group dedicated to writing extensions with ColdFusion Builder? You can find it <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/cfb-extensions-dev">here</a>. Earlier today Dave Ferguson asked an interesting question. He had an extension with a great number of actions. However, all these actions really just needed to run one particular ColdFusion file. Let's take a look at what he tried first and what a good possible fix could be.</p>

<p>
<p>His first attempt/thought was something like this:</p>
<p>
<code>
&lt;handler id="test1" type="CFM" filename="test.cfm?x=1" /&gt;
&lt;handler id="test2" type="CFM" filename="test.cfm?x=2" /&gt;
&lt;handler id="test3" type="CFM" filename="test.cfm?x=3" /&gt;
</code>
<p>
<p>Basically - 3 different commands all running one CFM file but passing a URL variable to indicate which type of action should be run. Unfortunately this doesn't work at all. When I tried this the extension said no response was returned.</p>
<p>
<p>So what would I recommend? Make use of onMissingTemplate. Consider this example - first - the XML I used in the ide_config.xml file:</p>
<p>
<code>
&lt;handler id="test1" type="CFM" filename="test2.cfm" /&gt;
&lt;handler id="test2" type="CFM" filename="test3.cfm" /&gt;
&lt;handler id="test3" type="CFM" filename="test4.cfm" /&gt;
</code>
<p>
<p>None of these files exist. In my Application.cfc I then used:</p>
<p>
<code>
public boolean function onMissingTemplate(string targetpage) {
	request.requested = arguments.targetpage;
	include "test.cfm";
	return true;
}
</code>
<p>
<p>All my code here does is take the requested template and store it into the Request scope. Using &quot;requested&quot; as a key in the Request scope may be a bit confusing, but, whatever. I then include the primary CFM that will handle all the requests. Your code could then do whatever it needs to based on the request variable.</p>
