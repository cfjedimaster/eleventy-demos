<p>This morning I received an email from Nadia asking the following:</p>
<blockquote>
I do check your website and also the Robots.com website for CF tips and info especially about security.
I am A Ph.D. Student and am required to write a paper and try to submit it to the ACM Journal. I have had some experience with ColdFusion Security Fixes, at my previous job at JSC-NASA. I am thinking to write my paper about Preventive measure in CF against security threats in regards to SQL Injection, XSS and maybe CSRF Attacks and recommended steps to mitigate these vulnerabilities.
<p>I have two questions: I was wondering if you have links somewhere to these topics, like recent blogs or something. My other question would be would there be a more recently related CF Security problems and fixes that I can write about?</p>

<p>This is a topic that comes up pretty often. There <i>is</i> an official Adobe ColdFusion Security page: <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/coldfusion/security.html">http://www.adobe.com/devnet/coldfusion/security.html</a>. It's pretty bare but has the <b>damn</b> good lockdown guide by Pete Freitag. This PDF is more server related then code related, but I'd consider it required reading for any ColdFusion installation.</p>
<p>You mentioned robots.com. I assume you mean 12robots.com which is Jason Dean's blog. You can find his security category here: <a href="http://www.12robots.com/index.cfm/Security">http://www.12robots.com/index.cfm/Security</a></p>
<p>Pete Freitag (author of the lockdown guide above) also has a security category for his blog: <a href="http://www.petefreitag.com/tag/security">http://www.petefreitag.com/tag/security</a></p>
<p>Finally, I'd also mention UGTV - here is a search page for security: <a href="http://www.carehart.org/ugtv/list.cfm?search=security">http://www.carehart.org/ugtv/list.cfm?search=security</a></p>
<p>Hopefully this is enough to get you started. Readers - please feel free to add more links.</p>
