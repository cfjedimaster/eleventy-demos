<h1>Post</h1>

<p>I'm very proud (and somewhat intimidated) to announce that I'll be speaking at the <a href="http://events.jquery.org/2011/sf-bay-area/">jQuery Conference</a> in the Bay Area next month (April 16-17). I'll be giving a presentation on jQuery Mobile. This is my first non-ColdFusion related conference so I'm somewhat nervous, but I cannot describe how honored I feel to have this opportunity. I highly recommend checking out the <a href="http://events.jquery.org/2011/sf-bay-area/schedule/">schedule</a> and attending if you can. Wish me luck!</p>
