<p>This Thursday, April 7th, at 11CST (Cool Standard Time), I'll be giving a presentation to the Online ColdFusion Meetup on HTML5:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.meetup.com/coldfusionmeetup/events/17147229/">&quot;A Gentle Introduction to HTML5&quot;, with Raymond Camden</a></p>
<p>This presentation is a code heavy exploration of various HTML5 features. I'll talk about new tags and JavaScript APIs primarily since my CSS skills are still stuck in the 90s. I'll catch up to CSS3 about the time CSS9 is out. This meeting will be recorded and I'll provide full source code afterwards in case you miss it.</p>
<p>This presentation is online so you just need a computer and a semi-quiet place to attend. Actually scratch that - you can use Connect on a mobile device now!</p>
