<p>I'm very proud to announce that I'll be part of a team of folks speaking at the <a href="http://www.cfobjective.com/">cfObjective</a> keynote this year. I'll be presenting along with Jason Dean, Mark Mandel, Bob Silverberg, and Scott Stroz. (Although I worry about Scott. He is pretty shy.) You definitely do not want to miss this!</p>
<p>Also - don't forget to consider giving a <a href="http://engage.cfobjective.com/">Lightning Talk</a>, or as I call them, the Pokemon-Pekachu session. These are very short driven talks that require a lot of planning to pull off just right. It's a bit scary - even as an experienced presenter - but they can be a lot of fun as well. I've proposed one on adoption and I hope it's gets chosen.</p>
