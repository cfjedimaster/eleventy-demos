<p>Here is a little feature I don't see folks use too often, and it wasn't actually working right for Solr in ColdFusion 9.0 (but corrected in 9.0.1), but did you know that it was possible to perform a search within the results of a previous search using ColdFusion's Solr integration? (Technically this is also possible with Verity, but it's best we ignore this as it doesn't have much a life expectancy anymore in ColdFusion.)</p>

<p>In simplest terms, providing previousCriteria to the cfsearch tag will perform a &quot;search within a search&quot;, so if searching for food, for example, returned 100 results out a possible 1000, doing a second search for beer and using previousCriteria=&quot;food&quot; will return a number smaller.</p>
<p/>
<p>Here is an incredibly simple example:</p>
<p/>
<code>
&lt;cfsearch collection="cfdocs" criteria="cfsearch" name="results"&gt;
&lt;cfoutput&gt;Search for coldfusion: Returned #results.recordCount#
results.&lt;p/&gt;&lt;/cfoutput&gt;
<p>&lt;cfsearch collection=&quot;cfdocs&quot; criteria=&quot;solr&quot;
previouscriteria=&quot;cfsearch&quot; name=&quot;results&quot;&gt;
&lt;cfoutput&gt;Search for cffeed within coldfusion: Returned
#results.recordCount# results.&lt;p/&gt;&lt;/cfoutput&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;cfsearch collection=&quot;cfdocs&quot; criteria=&quot;solr&quot; name=&quot;results&quot;&gt;
&lt;cfoutput&gt;Search for cffeed by itself: Returned #results.recordCount#
results.&lt;p/&gt;&lt;/cfoutput&gt;
</code></p>
<p/>
<p>In this example my initial search is for cfsearch itself (I'm searching the ColdFusion docs so hopefully that makes sense). I then search for solr and provide cfsearch as the previousCriteria. As a final test, I search for solr by itself. My results were:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>
Search for coldfusion: Returned 39 results.<br/>
Search for cffeed within coldfusion: Returned 7 results.<br/>
Search for cffeed by itself: Returned 24 results.
</blockquote>

<p>Nice little feature, and interesting to use, but it seems like something you don't encounter in the wild too much. I wonder if it confuses users too much? Either way - hope this little tidbit helps.</p>
