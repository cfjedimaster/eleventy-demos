<p>This probably falls into the obvious category, but if you are using ORM and have code that sets the datasource in the ormsettings, it will <b>not</b> apply to basic cfquery calls.</p>
<p>
<code>
//Application.cfc
this.ormEnabled=true;
this.ormSettings.datasource="monkeypower";
<p>//foo.cfc
var q = new com.adobe.coldfusion.query();
q.setSQL(&quot;select mediatype from media where media like :search&quot;);
var results = q.execute().getResult();</p>
<p>//ERROR!
</code></p>
<p>
<p>But - if you set this.datasource, it applies to both your cfquery calls as well as your ORM calls.</p>
<p>
<code>
//Application.cfc
this.datasource="monkeypower";
this.ormEnabled=true;
<p>//foo.cfc
var q = new com.adobe.coldfusion.query();
q.setSQL(&quot;select mediatype from media where media like :search&quot;);
var results = q.execute().getResult();</p>
<p>//HAPPY MONKEYS!!
</code></p>
<p>
<p>I suppose you could use different values for each, but I'd bet most people are using one DSN and probably still use a few &quot;basic&quot; queries even when making use of ORM.</p>
