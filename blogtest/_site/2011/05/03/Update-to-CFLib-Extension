<p>Many moons ago I wrote a simple (and ugly) ColdFusion Builder extension that allows you to download and install UDFs from <a href="http://www.cflib.org">CFLib</a>. I rewrote it last night into a view for ColdFusion Builder 2. Here's a quick example:</p>

<p>Selecting a category will then fetch all the UDFs...</p>

<p>And finally selecting a UDF allows you to cut and paste it:</p>

<p>Awesome design work, right? I thank <a href="http://macwebdiva.wordpress.com/">Dee Sadler</a> for giving me some good CSS links. Although don't blame her for the color scheme. That's all me, baby. Note that you can load CFLib as a View from the &quot;Views&quot; menu in CFB2 <i>or</i> right click on a file to launch it. Because you can run the app in a view I decided against supporting &quot;add to file&quot;. You can do that in extensions obviously (have been since version 1), but as a view I don't think it makes sense. While I removed one feature I did at least add search in.</p>
<p>Anyway - you can download it now at the RIAForge URL: <a href="http://cflibextension.riaforge.org/">http://cflibextension.riaforge.org/</a></p>
