<p>Looking for the docs for the new ColdFusion Builder 2? Yeah - me too. I've always found that a bit difficult to find on Adobe.com. From the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion-builder.html">main product page</a> click <a href="http://www.adobe.com/support/coldfusion/">Customer Support</a> to land on the main ColdFusion and ColdFusion Builder support page. In the right hand nav, click to expand Developer Documentation:</p>

<p>And there ya go. The install and using guide in both HTML and PDF. If you don't feel like clicking, here are links to the HTML Guide:</p>
<p><a href="http://help.adobe.com/en_US/ColdFusionBuilder/2.0/Installing/index.html">Installing ColdFusion Builder 2</a></p>
<p><a href="http://help.adobe.com/en_US/ColdFusionBuilder/2.0/Using/index.html">Using ColdFusion Builder 2</a></p>
<p>Of course, you can always just visit the <a href="http://coldfusionportal.org">ColdFusion Portal</a> where I've just updated the links.</p>
