Hi Ray,
<p>I'm a longtime reader (Deathclock.com anyone?), but today I'm finally asking a question of my own.</p>
<p>I'm trying to transition from CFStudio to CFBuilder2 - my workflow is remote and primarily FTP based. In Studio - and most other editors I've used - the file explorer  is split into two windows. One window for directory navigation and the other window to show the files contained in the directories.</p>
<p>So for a directory named /foo I might see several files in the file window:</p>
<p>bar.cfm
test.cfm
index.cfm</p>
<p>This is my question: how can I see the file attributes in CFBuilder2? Studio (and Dreamweaver I believe) shows the file size, type and date modified and makes it easy to sort by each.</p>

The view you mentioned is probably the #1 thing that I missed when I transitioned from HomeSite++ to CFEclipse (and then CFBuilder) a few years ago. Like most things in Eclipse the answer is a bit complicated and fuzzy. First off - the closest thing you would have to that old view is the RDS File View. I don't use this view very often myself. (I make a heck of a lot of use of the RDS Dataview though.) Once you've defined an RDS server you can browse the file system on top and the files below:

<p>Unfortunately you can't actually sort the columns. They are clickable for sure, but not sortable. If someone files a bug report for that I'd gladly vote for it!</p>
<p>If you just want to quickly get file information (size, last modified) and you <i>don't</i> make use of the RDS view, don't forget you can right click on a file in a Navigator project and select Properties:</p>

<p>You can also do this with the &quot;File&quot; view:</p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>
