Last year's conference was incredible and I'm really looking forward to this year. I'll be giving a session on building ColdFusion Builder extensions, so if you've never looked at that process before, please show up. I'll also be giving a small part of the keynote and a lightning talk as well.</p>
<p>I'm bringing three books with me, including the excellent &quot;Object-Oritented Programming in ColdFusion&quot; book by Matt Gifford. I never did get around to reviewing it (it rocks - buy it now - review done) but as I ended up with two copies I thought I'd share one. I'll bring my copy to the welcome reception tonight and will hand it off to the first person who can tell me what is best in life. (And yes, that's a movie reference and no, it's not Star Wars related.)</p>
