<p>Credit for this find goes to Adobe. I was recently working with an extension that created views and ran into a frustrating issue. Even though I was using toolbars, the toolbars would not show up. I dropped that extension for a while and later tried working on another extension. Once again I ran into an issue - this time with the icon attribute. (This creates a little icon to the left of your view title.)</p>
<p>Adobe discovered that there is a bug by where the views you create will cache their rendering chrome. By that I mean the toolbars and icon, not the stuff <i>in</i> the view. The bug bites you when you create a view that does not use these options and then modify it later.</p>
<p>To fix it, simply change the ID value of your view window. There is a bug logged for this already (you can view/vote for it <a href="https://bugbase.adobe.com/index.cfm?event=bug&id=2872436">here</a>) but luckily this is easy enough to get around.</p>
