<p>You can now download INeedIt from the Google Market. Either by searching for &quot;INeedIt&quot; on your mobile device, or just going to the <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=air.INeedIt&feature=search_result">web site</a> and installing from there. (If you've set up the Market to 'know' about your device.)</p>
<p>For folks curious about my earlier complaining about market access, it turned out my market account was using an account that I had simply forgotten about. Google customer service confirmed that once I set up a new Google Market account on my primary domain they would be able to transfer the apps over and reimburse me the 25 dollar cost.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, to sign up for Google Market access I need a credit card on file and the bug I reported <b>over a month ago</b> still prevents me from adding a credit card to my Google Apps hosted domain. <em>sigh</em></p>
<p>Anyway - download the app and try it out. And remember, you can grab the source here: <a href="https://github.com/cfjedimaster/ineedit">https://github.com/cfjedimaster/ineedit</a></p>
