<p>I'm very proud (and a bit relieved - I'll admit that) to announce I'm speaking at MAX 2011. My topic is: <a href="https://max.adobe.com/schedule/by-session/whats-next-in-coldfusion-/S2260">What's Next in ColdFusion</a>. From the description:</p>
<blockquote>
Take a sneak peek at new features available in the next release of Adobe ColdFusion. Some big changes in both ColdFusion architecture and abilities are coming up, involving HTML5, performance, mobile development, security, and all-around enhancements. Be among the first to see these new features showcased!
</blockquote>
<p>As an FYI, I've gotten some great submissions for the ColdFusion Unconference. I think we're going to have a great line up. Unfortunately Charlie had to drop off the &quot;Operating Committee&quot; (or whatever we call ourselves), but Scott Stroz has stepped up to the plate.</p>
