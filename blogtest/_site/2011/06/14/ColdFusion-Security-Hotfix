<p>I'm stealing this blog entry right from what <a href="http://forta.com/blog/index.cfm/2011/6/14/ColdFusion-Security-Hotfix-Posted">Forta</a> just announced, but it's for a good cause - spreading the word! A new security hot fix for ColdFusion 8 and 9 is now released. Details may be found here: <a href="http://www.adobe.com/support/security/bulletins/apsb11-14.html">Security update: Hotfix available for ColdFusion</a></p>
