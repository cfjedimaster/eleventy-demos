<p>At lunch I released a small update to <a href="http://www.cflib.org">CFLib</a> - author pages. Now when you view any UDF you can click on the author's name to see all their UDFs. Here's <a href="http://www.cflib.org/author/C4DA75DD6F95756886AD5218EBCE9A66">my list</a> and here's the list for <a href="http://www.cflib.org/author/F48C6C3C06C70FB42B371346FBAA6C82">James Moberg</a>. James is the one who recommended this feature so credit him for the idea.</p>
<p>I realized today that - I believe - CFLib is my oldest running ColdFusion site. (The Death Clock is older but I don't own that anymore.) I checked the Wayback Machine and found this snapshot from <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010722013830/http://www.cflib.org/">July 22, 2001</a>.</p>

<p>Even that isn't the real first version. ColdFusion 5 was released April 30, 2001, and I swear I remember launching CFLib while it was in beta, but at minimum, it has been around now for over 10 years. Be sure to check the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20011024020332/http://www.cflib.org/about.cfm">about</a> link from the Wayback Machine archive. I was the Principal Compliance Engineer for Spectra and worked for Macromedia at the time.</p>
