<p>I've been working on a quick start for <a href="http://www.jquerymobile.com">jQuery Mobile</a> for some time now. The draft has been done but waiting for some final edits. Unfortunately, the jQuery Mobile team decided they could still make improvements (what's wrong with those jerks!) so my quick start needs both some formatting updates and some changes to reflect recent changes. With that being said, I thought it might be useful to share the current version (minus most formatting) as it may be helpful to folks. Only a few things will change between now and final release, and I do think it is a good, and simple, introduction to the technology. But that's me - you guys let me know.</p>

<p>The real release will have a zip of files, but you should be able to cut and paste. I recommend using Dreamweaver CS 5.5 for your editing as it has built in jQuery Mobile support.</p>
<p>On a related note, community member John Farrar has released an online jQuery course: <a href="https://learnable.com/courses/jquery-fundamentals-1132">jQuery Fundamentals</a> This includes 7 lessons and nearly 40 different videos for a low price of $29.95. That's less than a typical night out at the movies!</p>
