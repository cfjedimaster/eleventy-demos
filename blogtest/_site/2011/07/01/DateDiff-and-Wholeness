<p>This surprised a reader of mine recently and while it falls into the &quot;Obvious&quot; category, I bet it's something folks forget - or may not remember when debugging a problem with their application. Without running the code below, can you tell me what the result is?</p>

<p/>
<code>
&lt;cfset today2 = "2011-06-21 16:09:06"&gt;
&lt;cfset testdiff = datediff("d", today2, "06/22/2011") &gt;
<p>&lt;cfoutput&gt;
The result of the diff is : #testdiff#
&lt;/cfoutput&gt;
</code></p>
<p/>
<p>If you answered 1, congratulations, you're wrong. Your answer makes sense. The first date is July 21st and the second date is July 22nd. But notice the <i>time</i> value in the first block. That's 4:09 PM. The second date doesn't have a time so it defaults to midnight (or one ms after midnight - I always get confused by that - is midnight the end of the previous day or the start of the new one?)</p>
<p/>
<p>The right answer is 0 and the reason why is made clear from the docs (emphasis mine):</p>
<p/>
<blockquote>
The DateDiff function determines the number of <strong>complete</strong> datepart units between the two dates;
</blockquote>
<p/>
<p>In the example above, a <b>complete</b> day had not passed between the two values, therefore 0 was returned. So what do you do if you want a &quot;practical&quot; or &quot;What humans expect&quot; answer? Drop the times. Here's one way - and there are probably about 10 other ways as well:</p>
<p/>
<code>
&lt;cfset d1 = "2011-06-21 18:09:06"&gt;
&lt;cfset d2 = "2011-06-22 16:20:00"&gt;
<p>&lt;cfset d1 = createDate(year(d1), month(d1), day(d1))&gt;
&lt;cfset d2 = createDate(year(d2), month(d2), day(d2))&gt;
&lt;cfset testdiff = datediff(&quot;d&quot;, d1, d2) &gt;</p>
<p>&lt;cfoutput&gt;
The result of the diff is : #testdiff#
&lt;/cfoutput&gt;
</code></p>
