<p>I don't normally mention CFMeetup's I'm not presenting at, but I wanted to give a special shout out for their upcoming <a href="http://www.meetup.com/coldfusionmeetup/events/24845341/">200th meeting</a>. The <a href="http://www.meetup.com/coldfusionmeetup/">Online ColdFusion Meetup</a> is easily one of the best treasures in the ColdFusion community. Charlie Arehart has done an excellent job leading this effort over the past four(!) years and deserves to commended. I can't make this meeting (will be on vacation and someone shoot me if I show up on Connect), but I hope folks can tune in to help congratulate Charlie and listen to what he has to say about the past, present, and future of the group.</p>
