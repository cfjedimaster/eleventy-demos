<p>I just published the final scheduled for this years ColdFusion Unconference at MAX:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/page.cfm/coldfusion-unconference">ColdFusion Unconference</a></p>
<p>Thank you Google Docs for making it easy. Obviously this may change a bit between now and MAX, but this should be pretty solid. We've got a few more things that may happen as well (prizes for example ;) so stay tuned.</p>
<p>Do not forget the Lanyrd page set up by Matt Gifford: <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2011/coldfusion-unconference-adobe-max/">http://lanyrd.com/2011/coldfusion-unconference-adobe-max/</a>. Matt will be updating the data there soon. Also note that MAX attendees will be able to see our sessions in the official schedule soon as well.</p>
<p>My thanks to all the speakers and co-managers Ezra Parker and Scott Stroz.</p>
