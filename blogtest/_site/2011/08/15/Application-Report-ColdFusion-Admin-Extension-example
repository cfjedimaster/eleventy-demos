<p>I was having a discussion on a private list when David McGuigan came up with a very interesting idea. What he proposed is <i>very</i> cool and much more than what I'm going to demo here, but I thought a simple proof of concept might be of interest. The core of his idea involved a ColdFusion Administrator tool that would give a live report of running applications. This tool would provide a wealth of data and features, but I thought I'd quickly write up a proof of concept for something a bit simpler. In this example I'll demonstrate how to make use of the Admin API, and specifically the Server Monitor API, to create such a report.</p>
<p/>

I wrote my proof of concept within the CF Admin folder which allows me to run all API commands without needing to login. So for example:
<p/>
<code>
&lt;cfset sm = createObject("component", "CFIDE.adminapi.servermonitoring")&gt;
<p>&lt;!---
Figure out what we have enabled.
---&gt;
&lt;cfset settings = sm.getMonitorSettings()&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;!---
Get all the active apps as keys, the func below also returns the ram use if we've enabled it.
---&gt;
&lt;cfset appScopeMemory = sm.getAllApplicationScopesMemoryUsed()&gt;
</code></p>
<p>
<p>The variable appScopeMemory returned a structure of active applications, including an empty one, so I create a list after removing the blank key.</p>
<p>
<code>
&lt;!--- we have a blank scope to remove ---&gt;
&lt;cfset structDelete(appScopeMemory, "")&gt;
&lt;cfset activeApps = listSort(structKeyList(appScopeMemory), "textnocase")&gt;
</code>
<p>
<p>Once I have the list of applications, I loop through it and run a few calls. For this simple proof of concept I just focus on the application and session scope usage.</p>
<p>
<code>
&lt;cfloop index="app" list="#activeApps#"&gt;
	&lt;cfset sessions = sm.getActiveSessions(app)&gt;
	&lt;cfset appvars = sm.getApplicationScopeMemoryUsed(app)&gt;
<pre><code>&amp;lt;cfoutput&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;div class=&quot;appBlock&quot;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;#app#&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;cfif settings.memoryMonitoringEnabled&amp;gt;
Application scope usage: #numberFormat(getTotalAppMemoryUsage(appvars))#&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/cfif&amp;gt;
Application Variables:
&amp;lt;cfdump var=&quot;#appvars#&quot; expand=&quot;false&quot; label=&quot;Application Vars&quot;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;cfif settings.memoryMonitoringEnabled&amp;gt;
Session scope usage: #numberFormat(getTotalSessionMemoryUsageForApp(sessions))#&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/cfif&amp;gt;
Active Session Count: #sm.getActiveSessionCount(app)#&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;cfdump var=&quot;#sessions#&quot; expand=&quot;false&quot; label=&quot;Sessions&quot;&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/cfoutput&amp;gt;
</code></pre>
<p>&lt;/cfloop&gt;
</code></p>
<p>
<p>Here's an example of the result:</p>

<p>
<p>I was going to spend more time to properly format the dumps... but meh. It's a proof of concept and it serves the purpose. You can click to expand and see all the application variables and active sessions.</p>
