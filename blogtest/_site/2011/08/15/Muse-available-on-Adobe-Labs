<p>Today we've released another new beta to Adobe Labs, <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/muse/">Muse</a>. What is Muse? To quote labs:</p>
<blockquote>
Muse (codename) enables designers to create websites as easily as creating a layout for print. Design and publish original HTML pages using the latest web standards, and without writing code.
</blockquote>
<p>Now - I know that is <b>not</b> something that will probably interest most of my readers. I definitely have a more developer-heavy crowd then designer. However, I do think you should check out Muse anyway. Why? It's an AIR-based application and easily one of the most impressive ones I've ever seen. The site tree, for example, works really well.</p>

<p>The design aspect feels pretty powerful too. You can drag and drop widgets in that tie into data (for example, a menu that links to your site plan) or your file system. The output HTML is kinda clean too.</p>
<p>For more information, and a FAQ on pricing, check out the site: <a href="http://muse.adobe.com/index.html">http://muse.adobe.com</a>. As I said, I don't expect many of my readers to need this tool, but I strongly recommend downloading and playing with it. It is a great example of what's possible with Adobe AIR.</p>
