If that's not enough though, there are two other sessions coming up soon as well:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/event/index.cfm?event=detail&id=1844274">ColdFusion 9: Ridiculously Easy: The Basics</a><br/>
<a href="http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/event/index.cfm?event=detail&id=1864012">ColdFusion 9: Ridiculously Easy: Web Applications</a></p>
<p>That's 14 ColdFusion sessions in the next few weeks - all free!
