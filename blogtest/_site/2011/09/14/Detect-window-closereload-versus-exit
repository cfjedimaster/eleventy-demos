<p>This was an interesting question that came in from a reader:</p>

<blockquote>

<br/><br/>
Problem is its coming on all hyperlinks, submit buttons.
and if i try to trap event object, its coming as NULL.

The code he was using made use of the beforeunload window event. Now - let me state right away I'm <b>hate</b> sites that do something when I try to leave them. That being said - he was trying to prevent folks from losing work when closing a window or tab by mistake. At the same time though he didn't want his safety code to run on simple clicks (or form submits). Here's the method I came up with. It just supports ignoring links, not form submits, but I'll throw it out there for folks to tear apart.
<p/>
<code>
&lt;html&gt;
<p>&lt;head&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;
src=&quot;http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1/jquery.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
$(window).bind('click', function(event) {
if(event.target.href) $(window).unbind('beforeunload');
});
$(window).bind('beforeunload', function(event) {
return 'pls save ur work';
});
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;body&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;a href=&quot;test2.cfm&quot;&gt;reload&lt;/a&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></p>
<p>
<p>Basically, I listen to both the click event and the beforeunload event. If a click happens (on a link), I unbind the beforeunload listener allowing the person to leave the page without getting the message. What do folks think? Ignoring the fact that it won't work on a form submit (but that's trivial enough to add), are there any other ways this can be improved?</p>
