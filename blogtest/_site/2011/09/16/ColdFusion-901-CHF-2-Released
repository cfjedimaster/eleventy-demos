<p>Subject says it all. Our second CHF for ColdFusion 9.0.1 has been released. You can find details here:</p>

<p>Some good fixes here, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>ColdFusion does not resolve the CFC's fully qualified name correctly when a relative path is used in the application mapping.
<li>ColdFusion throws "java.lang.IllegalStateException: Session is invalid" exception randomly.
<li>serializeJSON converts integer to string.
<li>serializeJSON incorrectly serializes nested objects. Also, in the case of circular references, for example, when handling bidirectional ORM relationship, repeating entities are represented as empty strings instead of empty objects.
</ul>}
