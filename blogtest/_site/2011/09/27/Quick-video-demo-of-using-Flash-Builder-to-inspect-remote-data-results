<p>Wow, that title sounds a lot more complex than it should. Basically, someone wrote me this morning asking about how to work with result data in Flex. I pointed out that simply debugging in the result handler would let you inspect the result object and see the structure of data. I decided to whip up a quick demo and record it. I'm fighting off a small cold so I apologize for my &quot;1960s Jazz Singer&quot; voice. Hope this helps.</p>
