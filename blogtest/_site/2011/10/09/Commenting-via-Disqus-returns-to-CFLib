<p>Back in the day (in the old days), <a href="http://www.cflib.org">CFLib</a> had commenting. I removed it when I did the last major update. James Moberg contacted me recently and suggested making use of <a href="http://disqus.com">Disqus</a>, a hosted commenting system. I had heard great things about it and thought that CFLib would be an excellent place to test it out. This morning I did &quot;the work&quot;, which ended up being approximately 10 minutes or so of clicking around. I spent more time FTPing then integrating code which really shows you how good of a job they've done on setup.</p>
<p>You can see a few sample comments already on the <a href="http://www.cflib.org/udf/sigJsonToImage">sigJsonToImage</a> UDF. I'll probably delete those when I get around to it.</p>
<p>So far I'm very impressed. If that changes and I'll post back a comment here. I'd love to know if any of my readers have used Disqus and what their experiences were like.</p>
