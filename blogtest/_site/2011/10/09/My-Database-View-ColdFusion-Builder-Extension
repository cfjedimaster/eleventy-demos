<p>For a while now a small bug has impacted RDS dataviews in ColdFusion Builder. I love the built in data views in CF Builder, but this little bug has annoyed me for too long now.</p>

<p>This bug, and a workaround, are discussed <a href="http://forums.adobe.com/thread/832568">here</a>, but in the meantime, I thought, why not just write a quick CFBuilder extension to get around it. So with that in mind, I wrote &quot;My Databasie View.&quot; Once installed, you can right click on any table...</p>

<p>This will pop open this view...</p>

<p>At which point you can edit the SQL and do whatever you want. The display ain't great, but I never realized how much I used the RDS &quot;Show Table Contents&quot; feature until it stopped working reliably.</p>
<p>You can download this at the RIAForge project I just set up for it - <a href="http://mydatabaseview.riaforge.org/">http://mydatabaseview.riaforge.org/</a>.</p>
