<p>My boss sent me this yesterday and I think it's one of the coolest examples of Flex/AIR I've seen in a while. <a href="http://www.gregstoolkit.com/">Greg's Toolkit</a> (I love the product, don't love the name so much) is a desktop/mobile application that let's you monitor your Amazon web service assets. It gives you a real time view of your instances. I don't have any great screen shots, but I'll steal one from his site:</p>

<p>His application essentially turns your Amazon assets into a virtual server room, allowing you to work with them in a much simpler, quicker fashion then heading over to Amazon's web site.</p>
<p>Greg's Toolkit is available for desktop, iOS, and soon for Android tablets.</p>
<p>By the way, if any of my readers are building cool AIR applications, drop me a line.</p>
