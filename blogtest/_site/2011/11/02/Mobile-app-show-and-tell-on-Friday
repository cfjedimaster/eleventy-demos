<p>I tweeted/Google Plused this a bit yesterday, but I'll be demonstrating my new mobile application on Friday. To be clear, this isn't a big deal. It's an application that has a few interesting parts to it and I thought it would be cool to do a &quot;Show and Tell&quot; and talk about what I did, why I did it, and what problems I'm having. I'm a big fan of &quot;Show and Tell&quot; sessions so I may do this more often if this one goes off well. The meeting will be held this Friday at 2PM CST. The Connect URL is: http://experts.adobeconnect.com/cfjediopenroom.</p>
<p>The meeting <i>may</i> be recorded. I really don't know how well this is going to work nor how useful it will be to others. I just want to show some code. I hope to see you there!</p>
