<p>Today's Friday Puzzler is one that I almost skipped out on. It seems too simple. But the more I thought about it, the more I thought it might be fun to actually see what people do with it. And since most of my supposedly &quot;5 minute puzzlers&quot; end up not being that quick, hopefully this one will make up for it. Being that I think this one is a bit simpler, the winner of the contest will be based purely on how cool you display the results. Use HTML, use JavaScript, use PDFs with blinking lights, I don't care. Go crazy. Your coding contest this morning is - build a utility that returns the digits of Pi up to N significant digits. So given func(2), the result should be 14. Given func(4), it would be 1415. It should work from any number up to 1,000,000. And if you create a solution that <i>can</i> do a million and render it quickly, you get bonus points.</p>
