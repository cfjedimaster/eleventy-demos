<p>Time for another quick ColdFusion Zeus preview. This one will probably be of lesser value to some folks, but it addresses an issue I've been raising for <i>years</i>, and that is:</p>
<p/>

<b>If ColdFusion knows something, I should know it.</b>
<p/>
Simple enough concept, right? However, it's not been easy to discover simple, trivial things about your environment unless you were willing to hack around it. Here's an incredibly trivial example: Session Management. How would you know if sessions were enabled for the current request? Currently you can't unless you try to set or read a Session variable and wrap the call with a try and catch. I love ColdFusion, but I have no qualms about calling that <b>stupid</b>. 
<p>
ColdFusion Zeus addresses this by exposing a new function, getApplicationMetaData, that returns settings about the current application. To be clear, it does not return application variables. Remember that the Application scope is a structure you can introspect easily enough. Instead, getApplicationMetaData will return current settings for the active application. Here's a quick example (and I snuck in a few things here too that are new):
<p>
<code>
component {
	this.name="moo";
	this.sessionManagement="true";
	this.datasource="cfartgallery";
<pre><code>this.mappings = {
			&quot;/foo&quot;:expandPath(&quot;./&quot;)
				};

this.customtagpaths=expandPath(&quot;./&quot;);

this.sessioncookies.httpOnly = true;

this.invokeImplicitAccessor = true;

this.inmemoryfilesystem.enabled = true;
this.inmemoryfilesystem.size = 10;
</code></pre>
<p>}
</code></p>
<p>
<p>And then here is my test template:</p>
<p>
<code>
&lt;cfdump var="#getApplicationMetaData()#" label="get Application Metadata"&gt;
</code>
<p>
<p>And the result:</p>
<p>

<p>
<p>So - how useful is this? Probably not very. Those of us working with open source libraries or those who ship packaged solutions though can <i>really</i> make good use of this. And darnit - ColdFusion knows this info, so should we!</p>
<p>
<p>p.s. If you look at the Application.cfc file above, you may notice a few new things. I'm not going to talk about all of them, but I will address one:</p>
<p>
<code>
this.inmemoryfilesystem.enabled = true;
this.inmemoryfilesystem.size = 10;
</code>
<p>
<p>In ColdFusion Zeus, you can now use the VFS on a <b>per Application basis</b>. That means an Application can use a vfs folder like ram://info and not worry about another application using the same folder. Your virtual files and folders are 100% black boxes into your Application-memory space. You can also configure your own size too. Nice.</p>
