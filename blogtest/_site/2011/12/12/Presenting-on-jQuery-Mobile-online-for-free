<p>This Wednesday at 3PM EST I'll be presenting on jQuery Mobile as part of <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/">CodeProject</a>'s &quot;Tech Talk Series.&quot; This is completely free and available online. You can register for the event here: <a href="https://www3.gotomeeting.com/register/687340126">https://www3.gotomeeting.com/register/687340126</a></p>
<p>I'll also - very soon now - be releasing a course on jQuery Mobile for Udemy. This is more of the same material, but taken a bit slower as I don't have a time restriction. I'll also be adding some lessons to it that cover a few random related topics. Like my <a href="http://www.udemy.com/introduction-to-jquery/">jQuery</a> course this will be commercial (20 bucks - cheaper than my wishlist! ;).</p>
