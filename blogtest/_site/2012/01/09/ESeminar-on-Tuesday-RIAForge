<p>Tomorrow, at 11AM CST, I'll be giving an online presentation on RIAForge. I'll discuss how it was created, why it was created, and will dig a bit into the code. I don't imagine this is something of interest to most of my readers - but all are welcome. Note that you have to register for the event to get the Connect URL.</p>
