<p>I just typed this code in and I thought I'd share it to see if I was the only one who did this.</p>
<p/>
<p>I'm working on a process where I need to do one of two things. Tonight I'm working on the first branch, but the second branch may not be worked on for a while. In the past I'd do something like so normally:</p>
<p/>
<code>
&lt;cfif condition&gt;
  what I'm doing
&lt;cfelse&gt;
&lt;/cfif&gt;
</code>
<p/>
<p>If I was half-way awake, I'd maybe even do this:</p>
<p/>
<code>
&lt;cfif condition&gt;
  what I'm doing
&lt;cfelse&gt;
  &lt;!--- do the other thing ---&gt;
&lt;/cfif&gt;
</code>
<p/>
<p>That works, but lately, I've been using cfthrow. The point being that if I forgot to actually code the other block, the second it does being to fire, I can't ignore it.</p>
<p/>
<code>
&lt;cfif condition&gt;
  what I'm doing
&lt;cfelse&gt;
  &lt;cfthrow message="Implement this block"&gt;
&lt;/cfif&gt;
</code>
<p/>
<p>Anyone else do this?</p>
