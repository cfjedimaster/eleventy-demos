<p>Thanks for this goes to <a href="http://paulirish.com/">Paul Irish</a>. For a while now I've been trying to find a way to search for a value across multiple files that are loaded in a browser request. But every time I used the Search field in Chrome Dev tools, it would only search the current file. I'm talking about the highlighted search field below:</p>

<p>Yes - I know - my MSPaint skills suck. ;) As I said, that only searches the current file. If there are a bunch of JavaScript files in one request, you're screwed unless you feel like manually switching from one to another.</p>
<p>But it turns out there's <i>another</i> search form you can open with ctrl-shift-f (cmd-opt-f on OSX):</p>

<p>Not only will it search across all files (not just JavaScript), it supports case sensitivity and regex based searches as well.</p>
<p>Anyway - thanks again to Paul for sharing the tip and I hope it helps others.</p>
