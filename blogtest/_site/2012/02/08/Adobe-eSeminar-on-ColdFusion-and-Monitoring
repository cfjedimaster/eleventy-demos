<h2>Monitoring ColdFusion with FusionReactor</h2>
<p>February 22, 2012</p>
<p>If your CF server starts acting up, how do you go about resolving problems? If you're on ColdFusion 8 or 9 Enterprise, you may know that you have a built-in ColdFusion Server Monitor. Did you know there is an alternative tool that supplements it well? FusionReactor is a commercial third-party tool, which can monitor not only any version of CF (6, 7, 8 or 9, whether Standard or Enterprise) but also Livecycle and any other Java web application or server in your environment. (www.fusion-reactor.com)</p>
<p>Such monitoring is about more than &quot;watching a screen&quot;. You can arrange to receive email alerts with valuable information (sort of a black box recording before a crash), and FusionReactor also creates really valuable logs that can also help with post-mortem analysis. They can also assist with deciding on CF server configuration settings, watch trends for hardware upgrades, and more. And as of FusionReactor 4, these logs now track information that previous only the CF Server Monitor displayed (but didn't log at all).  Finally, an additional tool, FusionAnalytics, can help analyze and visualize that data over minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, and so on.</p>
<p>In this 50-minute session, veteran CF troubleshooter and independent consultant Charlie Arehart will introduce and demonstrate these and other key features of FusionReactor (including stack tracing and crash protection), and will end with a brief demo of FusionAnaytics (www.fusion-analytics.com)</p>
