<p>This is something that probably everyone knows, and frankly, if I had taken the time to actually look it would have been obvious, but credit goes to <a href="http://remotesynthesis.com/">Brian Rinaldi</a> for letting me know about it.</p>
<p>Do you hate it when you paste text into MS Word and it tries keep the formatting from the original source? I know I do. I can't remember <b>ever</b> wanting my paste to keep the original formatting. Maybe I'm weird. (Ok, I am...) Turns out it's easy to fix.</p>
<p>Go into Options, Advanced, and set the value in the <b>Cut, copy, and paste</b> section for &quot;Pasting from other programs:&quot;</p>

<p>Finally, our long national nightmare can finally come to an end...</p>
