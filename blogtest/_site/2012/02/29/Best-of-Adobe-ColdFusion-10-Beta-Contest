<p>I'm happy to announce that we are running another &quot;Best of ColdFusion&quot; contest to celebrate the public beta release of the next version of <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/coldfusion10/">Adobe ColdFusion 10 (Beta)</a>.</p>
<p>The contest rules are simple: Design an application (and that can be a &quot;real&quot; app, a one page template, even a mobile application driven by ColdFusion on the back end) that highlights a new ColdFusion 10 feature. You can highlight any ColdFusion 10 feature (or features).</p>
<p>Unlike before, contest entries will be shared immediately with everyone via our Facebook page. (URL soon!) You will be able to play with the contest entries. There will still be a series of public blog posts talking about the entries and reviewing them, but you can see right away what other entrants are doing. Even better, you get a chance to help pick the winners.</p>
<p>We will be giving away 2 copies of Adobe ColdFusion 10 Enterprise and Adobe ColdFusion Builder 2.0.1. Two of the winners will be chosen by myself and Rakshith (ColdFusion Product Manager) based on a purely &quot;This is cool!&quot; rating system. The other two winners will be entirely driven by &quot;Likes&quot; on the Facebook page.</p>
<p>As before, this contest is open to anyone and everyone, and all entries must be licensed via an open source license. To submit your entry, please email a zip to raymondcamden@gmail.com.</p>
<p>Participating in the contest constitutes permission to Adobe Systems Incorporated to use the applications created and participants' pictures and/or name and/ or other particulars and /or likeness for the purposes of advertising, trade and promotion of Adobe ColdFusion or otherwise without further compensation and notification to the participant and authorization from the participant.</p>
<p>The contest runs from now until May 1st.</p>
