<p>Earlier this week <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/gamesover">James Moberg</a> introduced me to a cool little Java utility - <a href="http://jsoup.org/">jsoup</a>. jsoup provides jQuery-like HTML manipulation to your server. Given a string, or a URL, you can do things like, find all the images, look for links to a PDF, and so on. Basically - jQuery for the server. I thought I'd whip up a quick ColdFusion-based demo of this so I could see how well it works.</p>

<p>
<p>I began by downloading the jar file and dropping into a folder called jars. Then, using ColdFusion 10, it was trivial to make it available to my code:</p>
<p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/2319685.js?file=gistfile1.cfm"></script>
<p>
<p>I then whipped up a demo that loaded (and cached) CNN's html. I create an instance of jsoup, parse the HTML, and then run a &quot;select&quot; using my selector, in this case, just 'img':</p>
<p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/2319699.js?file=index.cfm"></script>
<p>
<p>Notice how I can loop over the matches and grab attributes from each one. Again, very jQuery-like. I wanted to play with this a bit more free form so I created an application that lets me supply any URL and any selector. Here's that code - minus the UI cruft around it:</p>
<p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/2319712.js?file=tester.cfm"></script>
<p>
<p>You can run this yourself by hitting the demo below. All in all - a very interesting Java library. Sure you could do all of this with regular expressions, but I find this syntax a heck of a lot more friendly. (And that's with me having used regex for the past 15 years.)</p>

<p>Talk about synchronicity - within 10 minutes of each other, both Ben Nadel and I posted on the same topic! <a href="http://www.bennadel.com/blog/2358-Parsing-Traversing-And-Mutating-HTML-With-ColdFusion-And-jSoup.htm">Parsing, Traversing, And Mutating HTML With ColdFusion And jSoup</a></p>
