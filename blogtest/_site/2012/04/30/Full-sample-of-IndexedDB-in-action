<p>After a bit more sweat and tears, I've now got a &quot;full&quot; (if ugly) example of an IndexedDB application. It allows you to create and delete simple notes. You can view this demo here:</p>

<p>Right now this demo is Firefox only. It doesn't work in Chrome because of the bug I <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2012/4/26/Sample-of-IndexedDB-with-Autogenerating-Keys">mentioned</a> in my earlier blog post. Here's the code - and again - I want to mention (and credit) the excellent <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/IndexedDB/Using_IndexedDB">MDN tutorial</a> for making this easier to build.</p>

<p>Nothing too scary, right? Using method chaining makes the code a bit more palatable and simpler to work with.</p>
<p>After getting this working, I began to look at how you can retrieve data. I guess I shouldn't be surprised (and @thefalken pointed it out to me), but you are limited to primary key lookups only.</p>
<p>So let me make sure that is clear. <b>This is not a replacement for WebSQL. You cannot search.</b> I guess - technically - you could search if you load everything up and iterate over it, but that's not really efficient. You can do range based filters, so for example, given a set of names I could go from Bob to Mary, but if I wanted to quickly find all the objects with property X set to Y and property Z set to A, then I'm out of luck. I was really thinking this was a Mongo-ish type solution, but I was wrong.</p>
<p>I don't know about you - but this is kind of disappointing. Maybe my opinion will change, but right now I'm sad that WebSQL is being dumped for this.</p>
