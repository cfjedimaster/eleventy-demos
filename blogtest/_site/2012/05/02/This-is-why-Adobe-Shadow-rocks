<p>A coworker pinged me about an issue he was having with a jQuery Mobile page and iOS. I got the code from him, dropped it in my local web root, turned on Shadow, and began editing.</p>
<p>The code in question had a bunch of JS libraries in play, and I simply commented them out one by one. My 'process' was...</p>
<ul>
<li>Edit the file</li>
<li>Reload the tab in Chrome</li>
<li>Look at my iPad and see if the issue was fixed</li>
</ul>
<p>This took me about 2-4 minutes to correctly figure out which JavaScript file was causing the issue. Adobe Shadow dramatically increased my testing speed and made the entire process a heck of a lot simpler.</p>
<p>So I know I'm biased, but damn - I'm sold on Shadow.</p>
