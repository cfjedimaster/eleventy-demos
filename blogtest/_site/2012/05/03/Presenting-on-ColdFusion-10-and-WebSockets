<p>Next week (Wednesday night) I'll be doing a presentation on ColdFusion 10 and WebSockets for the Salt Lake City ColdFusion User Group. This meeting is open to the public. Details (along with Connect URL) are available here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.slcfug.org/events/58085992/?eventId=58085992&action=detail">WebSockets on ColdFusion 10 with Raymond Camden</a></p>
<p>If you haven't played with WebSockets yet, this is a perfect opportunity to investigate them and see how easy ColdFusion 10 makes it. How easy?</p>
