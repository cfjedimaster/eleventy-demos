<h1>Post</h1>

<p>First off - a big thank you to everyone who attended my presentation at cfObjective today. I hope it was a useful introduction to some of the cool new stuff in HTML5. That sounds really lame, but it's honestly how I feel. The web (well the front end) is <i>incredibly</i> fun again. I'm hoping to do many more presentations in the future, but with a more focused topic. I'm doing a presentation soon on HTML5 Storage options and I'm planning one just on Forms. (Since, you know, forms are kind of important. Unlike other things. Looking at you Canvas.)</p>
<p>You can download the presentation and code from Github: <a href="https://github.com/cfjedimaster/HTML-Code-Demos">https://github.com/cfjedimaster/HTML-Code-Demos</a></p>
<p>It should &quot;just run&quot; in your browser, but some of the demos are a bit bleeding edge.</p>
