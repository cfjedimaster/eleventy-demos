<p>While at cfObjective, Sumit Verma from <a href="http://www.getslatwall.com/">Slatwall</a> let me know that they are doing an Adobe E-Seminar next week on the product. Slatwall is a free, open source e-commerce product that plugs into <a href="http://www.getmura.com/">Mura CMS</a>, another good, free, open source ColdFusion product.</p>
<p>You can register for this e-seminar here: <a href="http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/event/index.cfm?event=detail&id=2014594&loc=en_us">http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/event/index.cfm?event=detail&amp;id=2014594&amp;loc=en_us</a></p>
<p>By the way - I feel like we (Adobe) could do a much better job of letting you know about these e-seminars. Agreed?</p>
