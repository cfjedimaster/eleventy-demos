This is an entire week of online ColdFusion presentations from experts in our community. The best part? It's entirely free! Sign up via the link above.</p>
<p>Also - I've attached a zip to this blog entry with official logo graphics for ColdFusion and ColdFusion Builder.</p>
<p><b>EDIT:</b> Joe Brislin kindly gave me both a Windows and Mac icon file you can use for your CFBuilder or other needs. The zip includes his zip bundled in. Thanks Joe!</p>
