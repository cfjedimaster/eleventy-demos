<p>One of the more interesting features on the bleeding edge of HTML5 is <a href="http://dev.w3.org/2011/webrtc/editor/getusermedia.html">getUserMedia</a>. This API covers basic access to the user's audio and video devices. I first blogged about this a few weeks ago with my <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2012/4/6/Face-detection-with-getUserMedia">face detection</a> example. Since that time I've been curious what other uses would be possible with this support. As I said in the previous blog entry, chat and quick picture taking is kind of obvious. I'm more interested in the <i>not so obvious</i> (and possibly not very practical ;) examples.</p>

<p>In the excellent <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/getusermedia/intro/">HTML5 Rocks tutorial</a> on getUserMedia, they discuss how live video passed to a canvas object can be modified using CSS filters in real time. This allows for interesting effects. For example, Hulk Ray:</p>

<p>When I saw this demo, I was curious if something fun could be done with it. Along with basic color changes you can also blur the video. I thought it might be cool to create a user registration form that creates a crystal-clear image of you as you fill it out. I know many of you can't use this feature yet in your browser, so here are a few screen shots to demonstrate what I mean. Upon hitting the form, here is how things look.</p>

<p>And then I fill in a field...</p>

<p>And another...</p>

<p>And so on...</p>

<p>And finally...</p>

<p>How does it work? I'm going to assume you read my earlier post (or the excellent HTML5 Rocks article I already linked to). The basic gist is - once you've gotten access to the web cam and have directed the output to the canvas, you simply apply different CSS filters based on how correct the form is.</p>
