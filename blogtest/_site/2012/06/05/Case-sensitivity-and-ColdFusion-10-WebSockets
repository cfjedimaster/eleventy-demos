<p>During my presentation yesterday, a user asked about case sensitivity and WebSockets. The short answer is - they are not. Given a ColdFusion application that defines a channel called &quot;news&quot;, you can ignore case everywhere. That includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The cfwebsocket tag subscribeTo argument</li>
<li>The JavaScript object's publish and getSubscriberCount methods</li>
<li>Server-side functions like wsGetAllSubscribers and wsPublish</li>
<li>Subchannels. You can subscribe to news.sports and then broadcast to NEWS.SPORTS and the right people get the message.
</ul>
<p>There are a few more things I could test, but I think it is pretty clear that case sensitivity is not an issue.</p>
<p>There is one small nitpick to this. When you define the name of the JavaScript variable in the cfwebsocket tag, <i>that</i> string is case-sensitive. That makes sense as JavaScript variables are case sensitivite. But it looks like all WebSocket channels are going to be case insensitive.</p>
