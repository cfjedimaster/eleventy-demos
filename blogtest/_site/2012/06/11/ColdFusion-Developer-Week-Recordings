<p>Hey folks - if you missed any of the ColdFusion Developer Week recordings, you can watch any of them here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/coldfusion/events.html">ColdFusion Developer Week</a></p>
<p>My second presentation from that week, <a href="https://www.adobe.com/cfusion/event/index.cfm?id=2047479&event=register_no_session&loc=en_us">Introduction to ColdFusion 10</a>, is also available, but not much different from my earlier presentation on the topic. If anyone wants the demo code, just ask.</p>
<p>So... what did folks think? Honestly?</p>
