<h1>Post</h1>

<p>A few minutes ago (although according to the blog post this happened tomorrow), <a href="http://phonegap.com/2012/06/30/phonegap-1-9-0-released/">PhoneGap 1.9.0</a> was released. The post details the fixes and updates and I encourage you to read it for the full list. One thing in particular stood out for me - build scripts. Back when I used Eclipse, I had an additional plugin that would handle the proper inclusion of PhoneGap files and mods in a stock Android application. When I stopped using Eclipse, I resorted to the manual process, which isn't difficult but I had hoped someone would get around to creating a simple script to handle it for me. And the PhoneGap guys did. They rock.</p>
<p>Once you download the bits, you can find a <b>create</b> script for Android, iOS, and Blackberry. I tested the Android one just now. After first ensuring I had the Android SDK in my path, I simply ran the script and it generated a complete Android+PhoneGap project.</p>

<p>If you don't use any options it just uses a set of defaults but you can tweak the folder where the code is created, the package name for the application, and the activity. The generated HTML includes code that demonstrates a variety of PhoneGap APIs, including device info, accelerometer, geolocation, and others.</p>
<p>Once generated, you can also quickly send it to your device or your emulator with another few command line calls.</p>
