<p>This is interesting - Intel has created a Windows 7 port of PhoneGap (AKA Cordova). You can grab the bits at the Github project:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/otcshare/cordova-win7">https://github.com/otcshare/cordova-win7</a></p>
<p>Right now it is pretty rough, but you can test it using the free <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/products/2010-editions/visual-cpp-express">Visual C++ 2010 Express</a>.</p>
<p>Once you download Visual Studio, run it, and open Cordova.sln:</p>

<p>And then you can simply hit the green button by the word Debug:</p>

<p>If everything works out, you get an actual Windows application built from the files in the html folder of the project.</p>

<p>Note that there doesn't seem to be a way to go back from the demos they built. Luckily it's just HTML so I went in and added a link back to index.html:</p>

<p>The lovely pink markers are my work - wasn't sure if my machine's UUID was something I should share.</p>
<p>Note that using this project requires Internet Explorer 9 to be installed on the machine. I was able to generate a release build (an actual .exe file), but it didn't run properly. That's either the project still being in its infancy or me simply not building it correctly.</p>
<p>To be clear, this is not new. I've long been a fan of <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/air/articles/getting_started_air_js.html">Adobe AIR and HTML</a> but as a PhoneGap developer, I think this is pretty cool stuff.</p>
