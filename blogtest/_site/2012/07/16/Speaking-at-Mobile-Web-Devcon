<p>I kind of waited to the last minute to mention this, but this week I'll be speaking at <a href="http://www.mobilewebdevconference.com/">Mobile + Web Devcon</a> in San Francisco. I'll be giving my JavaScript debugging talk on Thursday. Then I fly to Portland that night to attend <a href="http://pgday.phonegap.com/us2012/">PhoneGap Day</a> on Friday. I'm not speaking, just attending, and you can still get your tickets as well. There will also be a PhoneGap Day in <a href="http://pgday.phonegap.com/eu2012/">Europe</a> as well on on September 14th in Amsterdam.</p>
