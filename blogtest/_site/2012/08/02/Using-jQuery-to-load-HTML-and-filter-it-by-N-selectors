<p>Forgive the somewhat awkward title. Hopefully an explanation will make things a bit clearer. I was working on an application yesterday that needed to load in a HTML file via AJAX and display it on screen. The HTML happened to be documentation so I was going to simply display it as is on screen. Since I wasn't doing any processing, my code was very simple:</p>

<p>Easy, right? Well, the first thing I discovered was that the HTML I was loading included things I didn't want - headers, footers, etc. Again though this is easy enough to handle. You can tell jQuery's load() function to filter down to a DOM item. (As a reminder - if you are concerned about performance don't forget that you are still asking jQuery to load N bytes of HTML even though you are using &lt;N bytes in the display.)</p>

<p>Woot. Almost there. This worked great, but the &quot;block&quot; of HTML this rendered was missing a nice header on top. I went back to the original source HTML and discovered that there was another div, header, that contained the title and would be perfect.</p>
<p>But here was a problem. How do I tell the load() function to select <em>two</em> DOM items? Turns out this was easy as well - just provide a list:</p>

<p>This worked fine. But this leads to my question. Is this a good idea? Is there a better way? (Assuming you can't get &quot;pure&quot; data and must work with the HTML files.)</p>
