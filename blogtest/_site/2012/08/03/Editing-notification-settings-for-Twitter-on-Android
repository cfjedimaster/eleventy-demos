<p>On the desktop I use TweetDeck for my Twitter client, and while it has a few things that bug me about it I've yet to find a better application. (My favorite feature is the one where I mouse over a tweet to click a link and the app decides to scroll a millisecond before I click. Yeah, I love that.) On mobile, however, TweetDeck was always flaky for me. When it got to the point where I was forcibly shutting it down once a day I decided to look for something else.</p>

<p>Imagine my surprise when I discovered the client from Twitter was pretty darn good. It was simpler, had a clean interface, and quickly became my default mobile client. I use it on my iPad, my HTC phone, and my Nexus 7. Recently though I ran into a weird issue. On the Android platform I wasn't able to find a way to edit the Notification settings for the client. It is very clear in iOS but for the life of me I couldn't see a way to do so on Android. I finally figured it out and thought I'd share with others. Hopefully I'm not alone in being a bit confused by the UX choices they took for this one particular feature.</p>
<p>Ok, so here is the default screen you see on starting the application up.</p>

<p>Right away I want to point something out. Even getting to the settings is a bit weird. On the screen shot above you clearly see a menu icon at the bottom. (Well, we could argue how clear 3 dots is for implying 'menu'.) On my Nexus 7 there is no such icon. So the next few steps apply only to the tablet (but work just as fine on the phone).</p>
<p>Click Me in the upper tab.</p>

<p>Now you can see a Settings link. Click that to go here...</p>

<p>If you're like me, a bit slow, this is where you get stuck. Scrolling up and down here I saw no options for Notifications. I pretty much gave up. And then... and I don't know why... I clicked on my name...</p>

<p>Note that there is absolutely no hint here that my name is clickable. No little arrow to the right. Nothing. But when I clicked... tada... it went into <i>another</i> settings menu.</p>

<p>Notice that &quot;Notifications&quot; has no visual indicator either. But at this point I had a good idea what would happen when I clicked it...</p>

<p>And that's it. I will point out that most of the options here are <b>not</b> simple toggles, even though there is a check mark. Nope - some of these guys lead to more complex menus:</p>

<p>I suppose that is kind of cool, but I wish they would also support an option to show me RTs by folks I don't follow.</p>
