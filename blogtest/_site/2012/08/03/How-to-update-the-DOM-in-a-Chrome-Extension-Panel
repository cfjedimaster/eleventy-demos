<p>A few weeks ago I <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2012/7/15/How-to-add-a-panel-to-Chrome-Dev-Tools">posted</a> a blog entry on how you can create new panels in Chrome Dev Tools. I've finally made some time to look more into this feature and I ran into an interesting problem.  (Before continuing on, I strongly recommend reading the earlier entry or none of this will make sense.)</p>

<p>When you define your extension, you set it up so that JavaScript is used to call the extension API and create a panel. You have one HTML file that serves as the &quot;devtools_page&quot;, which can then load JavaScript to create the panel which opens the &quot;real&quot; HTML page for your panel, let's say panel.html.</p>
<p>So to be clear, you've got:</p>
<p>devtools.html (doesn't need to be named this) loading devtools.js (ditto) which creates a panel called panel.html (ditto ditto).</p>
<p>To make things more complex, I had panel.html load panel.js. I attempted to do something like this: document.querySelector(&quot;#status&quot;).innerHTML=&quot;hi&quot;. Doing so threw an error. I did some testing, and even though panel.js was loaded in by panel.html, it didn't have access to the DOM of panel.html. (Or at least not directly.)</p>
<p>I backed up a bit, spent some more time looking at the DOM, and discovered the proper way of handling this.</p>
<p>When you create a panel, the callback function is passed a panel object. That panel object supports you assigning a few event handlers to it, one being &quot;onShown&quot;. If you specify an onShown handler, it gets passed a window object which represents the DOM of your panel.</p>
<p>This probably makes <i>no</i> sense. Sorry. Here is my devtools.js showing this in action.</p>

<p>Hopefully when I get this extension done I can post a followup that brings these tips into something more coherent.</p>
