<p><strong>Edit on February 19, 2016:</strong> This blog post came up on a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35512739/using-querysort">StackOverflow</a> post today. The code I used in my sort was based on a beta of ColdFusion and will not work in the release or more recent versions. Specifically, my comparator must return 1, 0, or -1, instead of just true and false. See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/35512880/52160">this answer</a> which talks more about it and shows an example of how you can now do sorting on query objects directly.</p>
<p>Back in May I wrote a <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2012/5/25/Taking-ColdFusion-Closures-all-the-way-to-11">blog entry</a> talking about how impressed I was with closures in ColdFusion 10. This was thanks to <a href="http://www.compoundtheory.com/">Mark Mandel</a> introducing me to the awesome <a href="https://github.com/markmandel/Sesame">Sesame</a> project. For the RIACon keynote I decided to share this and other examples.</p>

<p>I began with a simple example of how arraySort was updated to include closure support. Consider the following example.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/3353518.js?file=gistfile1.cfm"></script>
<p>I've got a simple static array of data I want to sort. I pass it to arraySort and dump the results.</p>

<p>Notice something? The bands that begin with &quot;The&quot; are sorted correctly, but not optimally. Instead, most folks would probably prefer them sorted by the letter after the word The. Using a closure, this becomes simple to fix.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/3353538.js?file=gistfile1.cfm"></script>
<p>I supplied a new function to arraySort that handles the comparison manually. If it finds that the string begins with &quot;The&quot;, it just removes it. This could be a bit more intelligent, but you get the idea. Here's the result:</p>

<p>At the keynote, I talked about Mark's Sesame library, but also <a href="http://underscorecfc.riaforge.org/">UnderScore.cfc</a> by Ross Spivey. As you can probably guess, this is a port of the ultra-cool <a href="http://underscorejs.org/">UnderScore.js</a> library.</p>
<p>It has got quite a few features, but one that I thought was <i>really</i> cool was memoize. Memoize takes a function and creates a cacheable version of it. So given some method X, you can pass it to memoize to get some new function Y, that given input A will automatically cache all future calls with A as an attribute. Perhaps an example will make more sense.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/3353562.js?file=gistfile1.cfm"></script>
<p>You can see I've got a function that can be a bit slow. Essentially it gets slower as you pass it higher and higher numbers. But when I pass it to memoize, the result, in this case slowX, has automatic caching enabled. The first time I call slowX(4) it will be, well, slow. But the second time I run it will return instantly. My result from this script was:</p>
<p>Time diff after first call: 1602, diff after second call: 0</p>
<p>Finally - another person doing cool stuff with closures is <a href="http://www.bennadel.com/index.cfm">Ben Nadel</a>. He's written a few blog posts on it, but one in particular caught my attention. He wrote a UDF called reReplaceAll. It allows you to take a string, run a regex against it, and then fire a closure against every result. Normally you can't do much with replacements. You can do a bit of logic like upper or lowercasing results, but if you want to do something very complex with a match, you have to manually step through each result and update the string. With his UDF, you can simply do your complex stuff in a simple closure. Check out the example below:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/3353582.js?file=gistfile1.cfm"></script>
<p>I've taken input text, used a simple regex, and then written a closure that wraps each result in HTML while also reversing the actual match. Very simple and direct to use!</p>
