<p>This is pretty exciting news I think. Today we announced the <a href="http://html.adobe.com/events/">Create the Web</a> tour. This is a sneak peek at what Adobe is doing to help advance the web with new tools and technologies. You've seen some of this already with our work on CSS standards and Brackets, but there is a lot more to come. Currently announced locations for the tour are San Francisco, London, Tokyo, and Sydney.</p>
