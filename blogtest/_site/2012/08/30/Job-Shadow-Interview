<p>Yesterday my interview with Job Shadow went live:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jobshadow.com/interview-with-a-developer-evangelist/">Interview with a Developer Evangelist</a></p>
<p>While I bet most of my readers already know what my job is like, you should check out the site anyway. Basically they interview people about their jobs and get really in depth about what the day to day work is like as well as things like time off and pay. I found the site <i>extremely</i> interesting. Probably the coolest one was the <a href="http://www.jobshadow.com/interview-with-a-tower-climber-2/">tower climber</a>. Anyway, check out my interview and stick around to read others as well!</p>
