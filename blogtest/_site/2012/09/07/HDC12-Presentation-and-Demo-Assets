<h1>Post</h1>

<p>Thanks to everyone who attended my HDC12 presentation (and who sat through my quickly set up presentation today when a speaker didn't show up). As always, any feedback (including criticisms) would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Both presentations can be downloaded at GitHub. I have a <i>very</i> minor update to the first one below that is not yet pushed up, but if I never complete the push to GitHub on this conference Wi-Fi, you won't be missing anything critical.</p>
<p>First - the debugging web apps assets: <a href="https://github.com/cfjedimaster/Web-Debugging-Presentation">https://github.com/cfjedimaster/Web-Debugging-Presentation</a></p>
<p>Next - the HTML5 Storage assets: <a href="https://github.com/cfjedimaster/html5-storage">https://github.com/cfjedimaster/html5-storage</a></p>
