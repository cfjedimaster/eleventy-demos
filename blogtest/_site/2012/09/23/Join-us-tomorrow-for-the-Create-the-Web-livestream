<p>Won't be in San Francisco for our Create the Web event tomorrow? Join the live stream of the keynote at 12PM CST at <a href="http://html.adobe.com/events/">http://html.adobe.com/events/</a>. I'm unfortunately going to miss the event (in person), but I'll be watching remotely as well. There are some <b>damn</b> exciting things coming. Stay tuned.</p>
