<p>Tomorrow I board a plane for Munich, Germany and my speaking engagement at <a href="http://www.cfcamp.org">CFCAMP</a>. While I'm terribly excited about presenting, I'm slightly more excited about the food. Oh, and apparently they make good beer in Germany too.</p>
<p>So - I need advice. Given that I love trying new food and beer, even ones that I don't end up necessarily liking, what should I look for in general? Remember - I eat <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boudin">boudin</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haggis">haggis</a> and sushi, so I'm pretty much open to anything.</p>
