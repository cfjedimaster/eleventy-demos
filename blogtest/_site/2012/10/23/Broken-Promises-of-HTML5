<p>I tweeted this last week and have mentioned it again a few times, but I wanted to ensure my readers watched this. Christian Heilmann is an evangelist for Mozilla and gave what I consider to be a damn good presentation on HTML5.</p>

<p>Now - I'll admit to having a bit of pride in hearing him praise Adobe here - but I <i>especially</i> liked the credit he gave to Flash developers. Say what you will about Flash itself, but some of the smartest, most imaginative developers spent years creating amazing web experiences and I don't think they get nearly as much credit as they deserve. Anyway - I'm probably a bit biased. Watch the presentation. It's definitely worth an hour of your time.</p>
