<h1>Post</h1>

<p>I apologize for the link bait. I feel bad doing it. But - at least you know I'm not a slimy SEO person and there is something useful in this article. ;)</p>
<p>Yesterday I <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2012/10/22/Simple-POC--Dynamically-select-an-element-from-a-list-and-skip-the-last-chosen">blogged</a> a simple little POC (Proof of Concept) that demonstrated adding a class to a random list element. As I said in the post yesterday, this was rather trivial code, but I wanted to share it because of the use of LocalStorage.</p>
<p>About an hour or so after I posted it, something began to bug me. I opened up the template and looked at the Network requests in Chrome dev tools.</p>

<p>Just in case it isn't obvious, let me break it down for you. My HTML document was a bit over 1.5K. The jQuery library, compressed, was 33K. To be fair, my HTML was limited to what was required for the demo, but even if I increased the size of my document ten fold, it would still be less than the size of the jQuery library.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong. I love jQuery. I <i>love</i> what it has done for my development, my career, and my skin care. (Um, ok.) That being said, you don't <i>need</i> jQuery as much as you think. Consider what my demo did:</p>
<ul>
<li>Run a function when the DOM was loaded.
<li>Find some DOM items via CSS selectors.
<li>Remove a class from one thing, add it to another.
</ul>
<p>That's it. Surely I could do that without an entire library, right? First, I switched to listening for the DOMContentLoaded event.</p>

<p>For finding DOM items, I made use of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/Document.querySelector">querySelector</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/Document.querySelectorAll">querySelectorAll</a>.</p>

<p>For adding and removing classes, I made use of the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/element.classList">classList</a> property.</p>

<p>After these changes, the size of my application was pretty much next to nothing.</p>

<p>Here is the complete template. Any questions?</p>
