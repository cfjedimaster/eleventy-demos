Hi, Ray -
<p>We're hiring again at Catholic University in Web Development. We have a junior to mid level position open right now, and I was hoping you could help spread the word as you so kindly did in the past.  We've put up a page at <a href="http://computing.cua.edu/about/divisions/web-applications-programmer.cfm">http://computing.cua.edu/about/divisions/web-applications-programmer.cfm</a> that explains a bit about the position and how to apply.</p>
