<p>While working on the Solr chapter for CFWACK10, I ran into a few interesting quirks that I thought I would document to - hopefully - save others from pulling their hair out. If you aren't aware of what Data Import Handlers (DIH) mean, it is simply a means by which you can tell Solr where your data is and how it should index it. It means you can skip the normal &quot;query and index&quot; process in ColdFusion and basically just tell Solr to get your crap by itself.</p>

<p>The first issue you will run into is with the sample XML provided by the documentation (see <a href="http://help.adobe.com/en_US/ColdFusion/10.0/Developing/WSe61e35da8d318518-1acb57941353e8b4f85-7ffd.html">this page</a>). It shows a dataconfig and datasource xml tag. But you should use dataConfig and dataSource instead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How did I discover this? That leads to my next tip. To debug issues, you want to check the logs under CFINSTALL/cfusion/jetty/logs. You should see a file named stderr-YYYY_MM_DD.log. I kept this up and running during my testing and it was very helpful in figuring out what went wrong.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The docs mention using the JDBC URL for your database. Initially I got this by opening up one of the core neo-xml files, but that was a mistake. In your CF Admin, go into the Server Settings page and scroll down to the datasources. Under each one you will see the JDBC URL used for your connection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Speaking of JDBC, in order for Solr to use a JDBC URL to MySQL, you have to copy ColdFusion's MySQL jar. Mine was named mysql-connector-java-commercial-5.1.17-bin.jar. You copy that from the cfusion\lib folder to the jetty\lib folder. You <i>probably</i> have to restart your Solr service in order for that to work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Speaking of restarts, as you edit your data-config.xml file, remember you can reload just one collection in the ColdFusion Collections page in the CF Admin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As part of the data-config.xml, you create a mapping between database fields and index fields. There are a few things you should know.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>First, ColdFusion will throw a fit if you do not provide a field called uid. I mapped the primary key of my data to this field.</p>
<p>Secondly, you can add index fields with any name, but if you do not follow the pattern that ColdFusion likes (title, body, *_s, *_i), etc, it will not work. So consider the following block.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/3996738.js?file=gistfile1.xml"></script>
<p>Note the ID/UID field. You must have this. Now note the last two lines. While I was allowed to index to a field called goober, it was not returned in cfsearch. But the one right after, booger_s, works because cfsearch will look for it.</p>
<p>Anyway, I hope this helps.</p>
