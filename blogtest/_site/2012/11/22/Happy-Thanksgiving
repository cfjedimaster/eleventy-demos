<p>I hope everyone has a happy and <i>safe</i> Thanksgiving today. As always, I'm appreciative of everyone who reads this blog and especially those who participate, either by asking questions or helping to answer them. Have a great day. I decided to use a new picture today. This comes from <a href="http://www.stephenhayford.com/">Stephen Hayford</a>:</p>
