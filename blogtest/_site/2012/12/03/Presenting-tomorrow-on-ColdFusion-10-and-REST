<p>Interested in learning more about ColdFusion 10 and REST? Tomorrow night I'm giving a presentation to the Big Lick (really) Adobe User Group. This will be over Connect and is open to all. (Although I'll be giving question/answer priority to the user group.) If you're interested in attending, it will be at 6PM CST and at this URL: <a href="http://experts.adobeconnect.com/zombies/">http://experts.adobeconnect.com/zombies/</a>.</p>
