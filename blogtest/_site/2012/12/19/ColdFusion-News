<h1>Post</h1>

<p>I try to avoid &quot;go see this link&quot; posts, but when it comes to important news, I like to ensure my blog readers are in the know. (I don't want to assume everyone is on Twitter!) A few days ago Rakshith, ColdFusion Product Manager, posted some important news about ColdFusion:</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.coldfusion.com/post.cfm/coldfusion-news-initiatives-and-updates-from-adobe">ColdFusion: News, Initiatives and Updates from Adobe</a></p>
<p>The post covers the business, education initiatives, and the possibility of a new Adobe-created ColdFusion conference. Check the post for details.</p>
<p>p.s. As a reminder - you should post your comments there, not here.</p>
<p>p.p.s. I still think the ColdFusion Next code names sound too much like 80s X-Men...</p>
