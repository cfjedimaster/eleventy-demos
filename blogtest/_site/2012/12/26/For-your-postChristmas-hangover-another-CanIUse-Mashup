<h1>Post</h1>

<p>This will be short and quick as I've got to hit level 24 on Guild Wars 2. A while back I <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2012/9/4/Mashups-of-CanIUsecom-data">posted</a> a few demos that made use of <a href="http://www.caniuse.com">CanIUse.com</a> data. These demos were kinda nice I think, although not the most prettiest examples of what you could do with CSS. Based on a suggestion from one of the commenters I created something a bit simpler and more direct.</p>

<p>Based on selecting a set of features, this new demo will tell you the minimum version of each major browser required to support those features.</p>
<p>So for example, if form field validation requires IE10 and canvas requires IE9 (<i>I'm not going to rant about this again I'm not going to rant about this again</i>) then the minimum version of IE you can use for <b>both</b> those features is IE10.</p>
<p>Here's a screenshot of this in action. As a reminder, CanIUse.com supports multiple browsers. The ones you see here were simply my list of what I thought was critical enough to include in the UI.</p>

<p>Ok, check it out, and let me know what you think.</p>

<p><b>Edit:</b> Based on a recommendation by <a href="http://jessefreeman.com/">Jesse Freeman</a>, I finally got around to adding 'bookmarkability' to the demo. Check this version: <a href="http://raymondcamden.com/demos/2012/dec/20/test4.html">http://raymondcamden.com/demos/2012/dec/20/test4.html</a>. As you select options, the URL will change. You can then bookmark and load up that version, or share the URL with others.</p>
<p><b>Edit 2:</b> After a bug was found in test3.html, I fixed it in test4.html and modified all my links above to just use that version.</p>
