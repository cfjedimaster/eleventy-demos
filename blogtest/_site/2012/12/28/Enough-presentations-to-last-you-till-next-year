<p>I'm posting this mainly as a reminder to myself on things I need to check, but here are two very large lists of front-end presentations that you may want to check out.</p>
<p>First - a YouTube list of videos from the HTML5 Developer Conference in October of 2012. This is over 20 hours of videos - free.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAIXSzgkhDs7gu24tYyS432v4AGZwPc8I&feature=plcp">HTML5DevConf</a></p>
<p>Note - this includes the &quot;Broken Promises&quot; talk I <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2012/10/23/Broken-Promises-of-HTML5">raved</a> about a few weeks back.</p>
<p>Next is a great article in Smashing Magazine from Addy Osmani: <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/12/22/talks-to-help-you-become-a-better-front-end-engineer-in-2013/">Talks To Help You Become A Better Front-End Engineer In 2013</a>. This is a list of nearly 40 presentations nicely split into sensible categories.</p>
