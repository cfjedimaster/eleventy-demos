<p>Would you like a free copy of the <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/phonegap-mobile-application-development-cookbook/book">PhoneGap Mobile Application Development Cookbook</a>? Packt has reached out to me to let me share <b>five</b> copies of the book to my readers. (People in the US, the UK, or Europe can choose a physical or electronic copy. Everyone else must select an electronic copy.)</p>
<p>To win, check out the book's <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/phonegap-mobile-application-development-cookbook/book">product page</a>, check out the details, and simply tell me which chapter you think sounds the most interesting and why. (Use the comments below.)</p>
<p>I'll use completely unfair and arbitrary methods to select 5 winners by January 20th.</p>
