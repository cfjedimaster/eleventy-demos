<p>Sorry for being so quiet lately. I've got three presentations this week and two brand new ones in two weeks. Mentally - it has been killing me. As with all things - it will pass. (And I think I'm building some good new presentations as well!) In the meantime, I thought I'd share a simple PhoneGap application I built for my four-hour lab in Ohio a few days back.</p>
<p>The idea behind the application was to demonstrate the <a href="http://docs.phonegap.com/en/2.3.0/cordova_accelerometer_accelerometer.md.html#Accelerometer">Accelerometer API</a>. This returns movement information along three different axes.</p>
<p>By itself, the API is easy enough to use. What I was having difficulty with was coming up with a practical example of it. I thought I'd create a simple application that mimicked rolling a die. I'd start off by selecting a random number between one and six. I'd display this on the screen like so.</p>

<p>(What you're seeing here is the Ripple emulator. I plan on talking about this in a few days.)</p>
<p>The code for picking and displaying a random number was trivial.</p>

<p>What was more difficult was figuring out how to respond to a shake. I mean, seriously, what <i>is</i> a shake, in code terms?</p>
<p>I did some Googling and discovered that most people simply tracked the X/Y/Z values and then compared them to historical values. I came up with this solution (which is based on what I saw so this isn't some brilliant discovery of mine).</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/4544413.js"></script>
<p>I then used the Ripple emulator to test, and slowly tweaked the numbers until it &quot;felt&quot; right to me. You can see the result below.</p>
