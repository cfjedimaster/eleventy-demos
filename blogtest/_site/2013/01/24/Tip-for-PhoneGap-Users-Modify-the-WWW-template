<p>Now that I've gotten comfortable with PhoneGap's <a href="http://docs.phonegap.com/en/2.3.0/guide_command-line_index.md.html#Command-Line%20Usage">command line</a> I'm finding myself much more productive when building quick demos. The previous link will tell you more, but as a quick example, this is how I'd quickly dump out an IOS project.</p>

<p>&quot;ioscreate&quot; is not the name of a PhoneGap binary, but simply a symbolic link to the create binary from the PhoneGap iOS directory.</p>
<p>I then CD into the folder, run &quot;subl www&quot; to open the www folder in Sublime, and run &quot;cordova/build &amp;&amp; cordova/emulate&quot; to run the build and emulate commands. This pops open the new application in my iOS simulator.</p>
<p>All of this takes about 2 seconds and works great, except for one small nit. By default, the new project has this fancy HTML.</p>

<p>You can't see it - but the green &quot;Device Is Ready&quot; is pulsating. It's very hypnotic.</p>
<p>What this means is that I actually spend <i>more</i> time &quot;cleaning&quot; the HTML, JavaScript, and CSS then I do actually creating the new project.</p>
<p>Luckily there is a quick fix for this. Given your desired platform, go to where you installed PhoneGap and you will see a &quot;bin&quot; folder and beneath that, a &quot;templates&quot; folder. There should be one folder underneath it.</p>

<p>See the www folder? Just edit the contents within there to your liking and the next time you create a project, your modifications will be used. Here's my version.</p>

<p>Ok, that's kinda boring, but I've got a nice blank HTML, JS, and CSS file ready to go in my editor.</p>
