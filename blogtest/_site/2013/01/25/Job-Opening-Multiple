<p>My alma mater, the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, has multiple web related positions available. They are looking for developers with preferred experience (2+ years) in SharePoint, Dynamics, or ASP .NET MVC and will also strongly consider those with knowledge of CF, Ruby, PHP, etc. You can find a full list here:</p>
