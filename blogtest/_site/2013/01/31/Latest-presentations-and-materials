<h1>Post</h1>

<p>I'm still at a conference in San Francisco, but I thought I'd post up the links to my last two presentations. These links are both on Github and include an HTML-based slide deck and demos. The JavaScript Lab one will be pretty useless probably without me presenting it, but the IndexedDB one has a set of demos that slowly build up. I think these could be useful for folks looking for some simple examples of the technology.</p>

<p>For folks interested in learning about IndexedDB, I'll be giving the same presentation online via Adobe TechLive on February 28th. Details <a href="http://techlive.adobe.com/ai1ec_event/using-indexeddb-for-fun-and-profit-mostly-fun/?instance_id=671">here</a>.</p>
