<p>This morning I spent some time using <a href="http://chooseyourownapplication.com/">ChooseYourOwnApplication</a>. The web site describes it as:</p>
<blockquote>
In this session, you will embark on a "Choose Your Own Adventure"-style project where you will make decisions as you develop a Single-Page Application (SPA). You will make technology choices that include JavaScript or CoffeeScript, Backbone or Knockout, ASP.NET or Rails or Node.js, and Heroku or Azure. When you complete your adventure, you will have a fully-working application built with the technologies of your choosing. The best part is, you can keep coding and recoding until you have not one but many incredible implementations of the Single-Page Application.
</blockquote>
<p>I went through the first two major sections this morning. I chose using JavaScript over CoffeeScript, Knockout over Backbone, and Node as a back end. In each step of the process you make small changes to the application and gradually make it more and more powerful.</p>
<p>Overall I absolutely loved it. It was easily one of the most fun tutorials I've ever gone through. I plan on going through it again with Backbone (which has very poor documentation imo), and this brings up my only complaint. From what I can see there is no way to start from an earlier decision. You can only restart at the beginning.</p>
<p>Anyway - check it out and let me know what you think.</p>
