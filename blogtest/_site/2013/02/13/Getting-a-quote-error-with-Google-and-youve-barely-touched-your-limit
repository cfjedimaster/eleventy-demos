<p>I spent the last 30 minutes or so trying to figure out why in the heck my simple Google Maps demo was giving me this error in the console:</p>
<blockquote>
This site has exceeded its usage quota for Google Maps JavaScript API v3. See here for details on usage limits: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/usage
</blockquote>

The "site" in question was localhost and I knew I was nowhere near my 25,000 daily limit. In fact, the Google API Console reported 44 hits over the past 30 days. To make things even more maddening, when I intentionally included a bad API key I got the exact same error.
<p>Turns out I had forgotten to <b>enable</b> Google Maps V3. This is done in the &quot;Services&quot; menu:</p>

<p>You must turn on API access on the relevant line:</p>

<p>Obvious, right? I just wish the console message had been actually helpful.</p>
