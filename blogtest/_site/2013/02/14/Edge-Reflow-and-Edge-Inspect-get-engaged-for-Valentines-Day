<p>Did you know that the new release of <a href="http://html.adobe.com/edge/reflow">Edge Reflow</a> had support for <a href="http://html.adobe.com/edge/inspect">Edge Inspect</a>? I did - but I wasn't really sure how it actually worked until I tried it today. What I saw blew me away. It was a bit confusing how to actually use it at first so I created this video to demonstrate the process.</p>

<p>As a reminder - both of these tools can be downloaded for free by signing up for the <a href="https://creative.adobe.com/join/starter?promoid=KAMVY">Creative Cloud</a>.</p>
