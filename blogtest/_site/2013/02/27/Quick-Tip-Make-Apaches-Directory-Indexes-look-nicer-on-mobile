<p>If you use Apache, then you most likely have DirectoryIndex enabled on your development server. This is the feature that lets you request a directory without a home document and see a list of folders and files. This is <i>not</i> normally enabled in production, but in certain circumstances it may be. (For a file download directory perhaps.) If you do any testing with mobile devices though you will probably find this index to a be a bit hard to read. Here's an example.</p>

<p>You can pinch and zoom to make that a bit easier to read, but it's a pain in the rear. Turns out Apache has a few options that allow you to customize how this index file is created. One of them, <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_autoindex.html#indexheadinsert">IndexHeaderInsert</a>, allows you to add HTML to the head section of the document. I added the following to my Apache httpd.conf file:</p>

<p>And the result was exactly what I needed:</p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>
