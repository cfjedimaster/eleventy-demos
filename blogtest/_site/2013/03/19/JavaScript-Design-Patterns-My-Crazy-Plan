<p>I've been toying with an idea for a while now, and I kinda figured if I <i>blogged</i> it, I'd be more motivated to actually <i>do</i> it. I'm currently reading &quot;Learning JavaScript Design Patterns&quot; (associate link below!) by Addy Osmani. I plan on posting a review of it once done. In the meantime though, I'd like to work up some examples of the patterns in &quot;real&quot; applications. Obviously I don't mean client work per se, but, something a bit more concrete than a sample in the book. I'm not sure I can accomplish this for every pattern in the book, but I think it might be fun to try. I don't make any assumptions about how good these examples will be. To be honest, I mainly want to do this to just help me learn the concepts a bit better. But my hope is that it can help others as well.</p>
