<p>Just a quick note to let my local folks (well, local being relative, New Orleans is about 2.5 hours away) about an upcoming event - <a href="http://swneworleans.eventbrite.com/">Startup Weekend New Orleans</a>. From the description:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
This is NOT a conference
Startup Weekends are 54-hour events where developers, designers, marketers, product managers and startup enthusiasts come together to share ideas, form teams, build products, and launch startups!
</p>
<p>
Beginning with open mic pitches on Friday, attendees bring their best ideas and inspire others to join their team. Over Saturday and Sunday teams focus on customer development, validating their ideas, practicing LEAN Startup Methodologies and building a minimal viable product. On Sunday evening teams demo their prototypes and receive valuable feedback from a panel of experts.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately I'll not be able to make it (celebrating my 40th birthday during that weekend - yes the whole weekend), but it sounds like a great event.</p>
