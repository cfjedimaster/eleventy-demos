<p>I'm a few days late for this (been a busy couple days) but my buddy and coworker Brian Rinaldi recently launched a new site, <a href="http://flippinawesome.org/">Flippin' Awesome</a>. The site covers the entire gamut of web-related articles - from design to code to everything in between. Check it out!</p>
