<p>On Tuesday, April 30th, I'll be giving a free, online presentation about <a href="http://www.phonegap.com">PhoneGap</a> as a preview of my <a href="http://fluentconf.com/fluent2013">Fluent 2013</a> presentation in San Francisco next month. This presentation will be your basic &quot;What the frak is PhoneGap&quot;-type presentation, but if you are looking for a chance to get introduced to the product, please join me.</p>

<p>(Wow - I need to update my <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/au/3437">bio</a> there. Apparently I'm still an independent contractor focused on ColdFusion.)</p>
