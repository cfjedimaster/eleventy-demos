<p>Warning - this falls into the &quot;Cool, but may not be a good idea category.&quot; I'm a huge fan of the <a href="https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/">Reveal.js</a> framework for HTML-based presentations and I've already posted a few of my utilities/tips/etc for making it work better (or at least better for me). One issue I've run into a few times lately is escaping HTML for code slides.</p>

<p>Reveal.js has great support for code coloring (color coding?). Here's a quick screen shot of an example:</p>

<p>In general this works simple enough. Here is how a typical code slide would look.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/cfjedimaster/5460558.js"></script>
<p>But if you want to include HTML in your slide then you run into a problem. As you might expect, your HTML will be rendered as, well, HTML, not source code. Typically this isn't a huge deal. Code samples are short and if you type fast, you can replace &lt; and &gt; in a few minutes, but after doing this a few times, and preparing to do some slides focused on HTML5 development, I thought there might be a cooler way.</p>
<p>By default, Reveal.js initializes itself immediately. I modified the code to do this after the DOMContentLoaded event and did some hacking:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/cfjedimaster/5460602.js"></script>
<p>As you can see, I simply make use of querySelectorAll to find all of my code blocks. (I could make that selector a bit more precise.) I then simply grab the HTML, escape the &lt; and &gt; characters, and then update the innerHTML property.</p>
<p>Voila!</p>
