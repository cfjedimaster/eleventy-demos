<p>Someone came up to me after my MAX session on web development debugging and asked for some advice on how to 'sell' unit testing to his clients. This was my response:</p>
<blockquote>
Simple. Tell the client you feel unit testing is so important that you're willing to talk about it with him face to face. In fact, you'll even fly him to your location. In order to save money though you're going to use a budget airline that skips testing.
