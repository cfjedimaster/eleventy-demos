<p>Due to a problem back home, I have to leave the conference early. I'm giving my Mobile Web Debugging session in the first slot this morning (this schedule change will be announced this morning). Dave Ferguson will be covering my CF10+HTML5 session and Matt Gifford will be covering my PhoneGap session.</p>
