<p>About an hour ago I gave a presentation on IndexedDB. One of the attendees asked about dates and being able to filter based on a date range. I told him that my assumption was that you would need to convert the dates into numbers and use a number-based range. Turns out I was wrong. Here is an example.</p>

<p>I began by creating an objectstore that used an index on the created field. Since our intent is to search via a date field, I decided &quot;created&quot; would be a good name. I also named my objectstore as &quot;data&quot;. Boring, but it works.</p>

<p>Next - I built a simple way to seed data. I based on a button click event to add 10 objects. Each object will have one property, created, and the date object will be based on a random date from now till 7 days in the future.</p>

<p>Note that since IndexedDB calls are asynchronous, my code should handle updating the user to let them know when the operation is done. Since this is just a quick demo though, and since that add operation will complete incredibly fast, I decided to not worry about it.</p>
<p>So at this point we'd have an application that lets us add data containing a created property with a valid JavaScript date. Note I didn't change it to milliseconds. I just passed it in as is.</p>
<p>For the final portion I added two date fields on my page. In Chrome this is rendered nicely:</p>

<p>Based on these, I can then create an IndexedDB range of either bounds, lowerBounds, or upperBounds. I.e., give me crap either after a date, before a date, or inside a date range.</p>

<p>The only conversion required here was to take the user input and turn it into &quot;real&quot; date objects. Once done, everything works great:</p>
