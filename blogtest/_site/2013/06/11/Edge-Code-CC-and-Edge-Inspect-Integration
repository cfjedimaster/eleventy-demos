<p>This is something I demoed a bit quickly at MAX but I thought it would be nice to create a video to demonstrate it more fully. The next release of <a href="http://html.adobe.com/edge/code/">Edge Code</a> will include support for <a href="http://html.adobe.com/edge/inspect/">Edge Inspect</a> directly within the editor itself. Make sense? No? Then watch the video!</p>
