<p>We just released update 11 for ColdFusion 10. Details here: <a href="http://helpx.adobe.com/coldfusion/kb/coldfusion-10-update-11.html">ColdFusion 10 Update 11</a>. Quite an impressive list of fixes. This also includes a security fix for the web sockets thing that <a href="http://cfmlblog.adamcameron.me/2013/06/web-socket-security-issue-risk.html">Adam Cameron</a> found a few days ago. (<b>Correction - Adam blogged about it, but Henry Ho found it. Sorry Henry!</b>) For folks running ColdFusion 9, there is a <a href="http://www.adobe.com/support/security/bulletins/apsb13-19.html">separate security hot fix</a> you should deploy.</p>
