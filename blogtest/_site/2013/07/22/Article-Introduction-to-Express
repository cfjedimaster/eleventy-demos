<p>I'm very happy to have my first article published at <a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/">Nettuts+</a>. <a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/introduction-to-express/">&quot;Introduction to Express&quot;</a> is a look at the ExpressJS framework for Node development. As I've mentioned before, it was the Express framework that made me <i>really</i> consider NodeJS development. Let me know what you think of the article.</p>
