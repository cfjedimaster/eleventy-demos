<p>It's been a while since I've done a Friday Puzzler. Josh Knutson sent in an idea that was good, but a bit simpler. Since I'm an evil bastard, I took his simple idea and made it - hopefully - just the right amount more difficult.</p>

<p>Here is your challenge. You are allowed to answer using ColdFusion or JavaScript. For ColdFusion, I suggest you use a Gist or Pastebin to host your code. For JavaScript consider <a href="http://www.jsbin.com">JSBin</a>. It would allow you to both host and run your example.</p>
<p>Your challenge - and remember - try to keep your work to between five to fifteen minutes - is to write a function that accepts two inputs - a starting geopoint and ending geopoint. By &quot;geopoint&quot; I simply mean a structure/hash/etc that contains a longitude and latitude value.</p>
<p>Given those two points, determine what direction the second input is from the first one. Return that direction in a simple form like &quot;East&quot;, or &quot;South East&quot;. Obviously this will <strong>not</strong> be precise, and that's the point. Most humans don't need to know that B is at angle 92.12 from point A. Instead, they want to know that it is east of here. (And to be clear, I totally guessed at that angle and direction there.)</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
