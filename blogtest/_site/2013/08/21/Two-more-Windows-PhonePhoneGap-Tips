<p>Please note the date of this posting (Aug 21, 2013) - what you are seeing here should be fixed rather soon and is probably not an issue at the time you're reading this. I ran into this last week and wanted to blog it in case others hit the same hurdles.</p>

<p>First Issue: When you create a new application via the PhoneGap CLI, the default ID includes the word &quot;hello-word&quot;. If you then try to build for Windows Phone you will get:</p>
<p>C:\Users\labuser\Desktop\pg3test\test2\platforms\wp8\App.xaml(1,1,1,1): error : x:Class=&quot;com.phonegap.hello-world.App&quot; is not valid. 'com.phonegap.hello-world.App' is not a valid fully qualified class name.</p>
<p>This has already been reported (and <a href="https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-cli/issues/156">fixed</a>), but if you run into this, just add the --id attribute: phonegap create pathtoapp --id &quot;com.camden.helloworld&quot;</p>
<p>Second Issue: If you run your app on the Windows Phone and notice that the deviceready event doesn't fire (the default PG app uses a pretty animation to let you know when this occurs), then the issue is that the index.html is loading phonegap.js. Change the script src to cordova.js and all will be well.</p>
