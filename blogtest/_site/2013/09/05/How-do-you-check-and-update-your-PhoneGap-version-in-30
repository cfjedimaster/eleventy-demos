<p>A tip of the rage wolf to fellow Adobian Brian Leroux for his help with this blog post. And by help, I mean he basically explained it all to me and I'm just making it pretty.</p>
<p>One of the big changes to PhoneGap 3.0 is in how you install it. Previously you would download a zip file, expand it, and have all the bits you need. Now the installation process has you use npm (Node Package Manager) to grab the bits.</p>

<p>I've been using Node and npm for a while, but I'm definitely still a bit unsure of how it works. The question I had was - how would I be able to tell when a new version was released and how would I get my copy updated?</p>
<p>First, remember that the phonegap CLI has a -v argument that tells you the current version you have installed:</p>

<p>Currently the PhoneGap site only mentions 3.0 and not anything more specific, so to compare your version to the latest in npm, you would do &quot;npm info phonegap version&quot;. This is demonstrated below:</p>

<p>In this case, my version is the same, but if I wanted to update, I'd run: npm update -g phonegap. I always use sudo in front but you may not have to do that (especially on Windows ;).</p>

<p>Hope this helps. Tomorrow morning I'll be blogging about how plugins have changed.</p>
