<p>The <a href="http://www.meetup.com/coldfusionmeetup/">Online ColdFusion Meetup</a> is back after a long hiatus. RSVP for tomorrow's meeting: <a href="http://www.meetup.com/coldfusionmeetup/events/149988492/?a=md1_grp&rv=md1&_af_eid=149988492&_af=event">&quot;Dive into ColdFusion ORM, the Water's Great!&quot;, with Bradley Wood</a>. The Online ColdFusion Meetup is a <strong>free</strong> online (duh) user group. If you do end up missing the meeting you will be able to watch a recording later. I strongly recommend joining the group so you can be notified of future meetings.</p>
