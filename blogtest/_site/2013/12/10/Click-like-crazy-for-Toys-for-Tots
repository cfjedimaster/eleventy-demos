Just a quick note for those of you with a bit of OCD. Visit <a href="http://santashelper.dvs.com/">http://santashelper.dvs.com/</a> and play the little gift building game for a few minutes. Get up to 5000 gifts and the company behind the game (DVS) will donate a buck to Toys for Tots. This won't take more than a few minutes, and <strong>you can stop playing whenever you want</strong>, honest.
