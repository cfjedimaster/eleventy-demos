I just ran across a template that had an interesting typo. Here is an example.
</p>
<!--more-->
<pre><code class="language-javascript">component {
<pre><code>{
	public function hello() {
		return &quot;Hello&quot;;
	}

}
</code></pre>
<p>}</code></pre></p>
<p>
See it? The function is surrounded by an extra pair of brackets. ColdFusion just hoists it up just like JavaScript, so I shouldn't be surprised, but wow did that freak me out a bit.
</p>
<p>
Then for the hell of it I went crazy - and yes - it still works.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">component {

	{
		{
			{
				{
					{
						public function hello() {
							return "Hello";
						}
					}
				}
			}
		}
	}

}</code></pre>
<p>
Anyway... yeah... don't do this. ;)
