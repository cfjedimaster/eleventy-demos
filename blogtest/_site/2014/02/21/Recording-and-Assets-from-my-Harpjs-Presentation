I just wrapped up my first "Hangouts on Air" presentation on <a href="http://harpjs.com">Harp.js</a> and YouTube has it available <strong>already.</strong> Dang that's cool. I've embedded the video below. You can find all the assets (slide deck and demos) at this link:

I promised a buddy I'd talk about how the Hangout went. For the most part, it went ok. They finally have a good QA app - one I discovered about 60 seconds before I started - and it worked well once I figured out how to use it. My only real mistake was accidentally turning on a virtual tiara. No, I'm not kidding.

But outside of that, I think I can handle doing more on this platform. And I <i>love</i> that it went to YouTube so quickly. Now I just need to figure out what to present next.
