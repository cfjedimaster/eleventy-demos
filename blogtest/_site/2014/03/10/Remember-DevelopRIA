<p>So a long, <i>long</i> time ago the site InsideRIA was shut down and the articles archived over at DevelopRIA. I blogged about this <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2011/1/28/My-InsideRIA-Archive">here</a> back in 2011. (The old days. Remember them?) As just an FYI, that site is now dead too. I was able to procure an export of all the data, so if you are an author of something from the site and want a copy of your text, download the attachment below.<p><a href='enclosures/C%3A%5Chosts%5C2013%2Eraymondcamden%2Ecom%5Cenclosures%2Fdevelopria%5Ftext%5Fbackup%2Ezip'>Download attached file.</a></p></p>
