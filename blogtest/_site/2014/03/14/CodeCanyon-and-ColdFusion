A tip of the hat to reader David Imrie who (many weeks ago) let me know that <a href="http://codecanyon.net/">CodeCanyon</a> is willing to accept ColdFusion snippets. If you have no idea what CodeCanyon is (I didn't until David's email), it is a site that lets you buy/sell code snippets for various technologies.

Obviously it is cool when folks share their code for free, but if you want to charge for your code, I say go for it, and this looks to be a good platform for helping you facilitate that.
