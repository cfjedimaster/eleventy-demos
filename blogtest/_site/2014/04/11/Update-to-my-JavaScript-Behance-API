After "speaking" with a reader yesterday about my <a href="http://behance.net">Behance</a> JavaScript API, I've decided to go ahead and promote it to a proper GitHub repository. You can now find the code here: <a href="https://github.com/cfjedimaster/BehanceAPI">https://github.com/cfjedimaster/BehanceAPI</a>.

I also updated the API to support getProject. There are still a lot of things missing. I'm basically adding functions as people ask for them, but with the number of demos I've built with it I thought it was time to move it over to GitHub. Enjoy.
