Very happy to announce the first publication of an article of mine on the <a href="http://hacks.mozilla.org">Mozilla Hacks</a> blog. This article is a bit of a departure for me. Less techy and more touchy-feely. Broadly, the article is a look at how HTML (well, web standards in general) are branching out of the browser. Probably some (or most) of this is known to my readers, but I felt like a look at this phenomenon was worthwhile. I hope you enjoy it as well.
