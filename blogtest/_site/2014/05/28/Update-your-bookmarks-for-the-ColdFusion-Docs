Some of you may have older bookmarks for the ColdFusion docs. Previously these old bookmarks auto-forwarded to the right address, but I believe that forwarding is no longer working. If you don't have the right URL bookmarked, here it is: <a href="https://wikidocs.adobe.com/wiki/display/coldfusionen/Home">https://wikidocs.adobe.com/wiki/display/coldfusionen/Home</a>. Also, don't forget my <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2014/5/12/Downloading-ColdFusion-Documentation">recent blog post</a> where I showed you how to download ColdFusion docs as well.
