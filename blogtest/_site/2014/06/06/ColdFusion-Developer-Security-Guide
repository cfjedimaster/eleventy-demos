Today (or round about today), the <a href="https://wikidocs.adobe.com/wiki/display/coldfusionen/Home">ColdFusion docs</a> published a new guide, the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/products/coldfusion/pdfs/cf11/cfml-developer-security-guide.pdf">CFML Developer Security Guide (PDF)</a> by the amazing <a href="http://www.petefreitag.com/">Pete Freitag</a>. This is a great companion to the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/products/coldfusion/pdfs/cf11/cf11-lockdown-guide.pdf">lockdown guide (pdf)</a> also written by Pete. Both should be considered required reading.
