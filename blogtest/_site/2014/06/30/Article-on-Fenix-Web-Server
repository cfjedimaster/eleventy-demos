<p>
Just a quick note to say that I'll be a bit quiet this week as Adobe shut down for the week and I'll be (hopefully!) catching up on some house work. Also - an article I wrote for the awesome <a href="http://flippinawesome.org/">Flippin' Awesome</a> went live this morning: <a href="http://flippinawesome.org/2014/06/30/easy-and-shareable-local-web-servers-with-fenix/">Easy and Shareable Local Web Servers with Fenix</a>. I hope you enjoy it.
