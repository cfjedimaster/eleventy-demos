I was originally going to be presenting just to the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/memphis-technology-user-groups/">Memphis Technology User Groups</a> tonight, but they have graciously said they don't mind if I open this up to the public. If you want to hear me give an introduction to Cordova, join me online tonight at 6:30 CST here: <a href="https://my.adobeconnect.com/raysworld/">https://my.adobeconnect.com/raysworld/</a>. I will be giving priority for QA to the Memphis group of course, but all our welcome to join in and - hopefully - learn something as well. This will be over Adobe Connect so be sure to use a Flash-enabled browser.
