This question came up on StackOverflow recently and I took a stab at answering it. The user had a list of data that included dates. They were looking to see if there was an easy way to add <a href="http://ionicframework.com/docs/components/#item-dividers">dividers</a> to the list automatically. jQuery Mobile actually <a href="http://api.jquerymobile.com/listview/#option-autodividers">supports</a> this out of the box - and supports it well. By default it will use the first letter of your list data as a separator (so "Andy" and "Al" will be prefixed with an "A" divider) but you can also use a function to specify your own logic.

While there is no similar feature in Ionic (I filed <a href="https://github.com/driftyco/ionic/issues/2484">this issue</a> for it) it isn't too difficult to build it manually. The CodePen I built handles it like so.
</p>
<p>
First, the controller code modifies the array to include an item for each necessary divider.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">.controller('RootCtrl', function($scope) {

  //orig data
  var list = [];
  list.push({name:"Gary"});
  list.push({name:"Gosh"});
  list.push({name:"Ray"});
  list.push({name:"Sam"});
  list.push({name:"Sandy"});

  $scope.list = [];
  var lastChar = '';
  for(var i=0,len=list.length; i&lt;len; i++) {
    var item = list[i];

    if(item.name.charAt(0) != lastChar) {
      $scope.list.push({name:item.name.charAt(0),letter:true});
      lastChar = item.name.charAt(0);
    }
    $scope.list.push(item);
    
  }
})
</code></pre>
<p>
That feels lame - I mean modifying the list - but I'm doing it in my controller and not the back end service so I can still sleep at night. The next change is to the front end. (And the Ionic team deserves credit for this as I modified this from one of their examples.)
</p>
<pre><code class="language-markup">&lt;ion-list type=&quot;list-inset&quot;&gt;
      &lt;ion-item ng-repeat=&quot;person in list&quot; ng-class=&quot;person.letter? &#x27;item-divider&#x27;:&#x27;&#x27;&quot;&gt;
        {{person.name}}
      &lt;&#x2F;ion-item&gt;
    &lt;&#x2F;ion-list&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
Basically - since a list divider is simply a class change, we can iterate over our array and include the class when the letter property exists in the data. I don't like the fact that I use person.name when I'm doing a letter, but, it works. I <i>really</i> think smarter people than me can do this nicer, so please feel free to fork the CodePen and make it nicer!
