<p>Did you know ColdFusion Builder 3 was updated? There was a tweet and blog post about it: <a href="https://coldfusionsolution.wordpress.com/2015/01/08/remote-server-settings-lost-after-restart-now-fixed-in-coldfusion-builder-3/">Remote server settings lost after restart, now fixed in ColdFusion Builder 3</a>. Unfortunately, the normal way of doing updates, the method that was actually used already for CFB3, was not applied here. You can't use the &quot;Check for Updates&quot; method to get this update. Instead, you must download the installer and reinstall CFB3 from scratch. Now - I'm happy that the installer was updated - that's something I've wanted to see for CF server for some time. (Even with the new updater, it would be nice if the bits you get were 100% updated.) But I don't understand why the usual mechanism for Eclipse-based projects wasn't used. I'm trying to find out if this will happen in the future for folks who may not want to do a complete update.</p>
<p>In case you need reminding, the link to download CFB is <a href="http://www.adobe.com/go/trycoldfusionbuilder/">http://www.adobe.com/go/trycoldfusionbuilder/</a>.</p>
<p>Quick show of hands - of my readers using CFB3 - how many of you knew about the update?</p>
