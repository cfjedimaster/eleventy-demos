<p>About two weeks ago I <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/2015/01/12/coldfusion-builder-3-updated-and-i-bet-you-didnt-know">blogged</a> about how Adobe had updated ColdFusion Builder but had - oddly - not used the regular Eclipse update mechnism to distribute the update. Instead the expectation was that users should redownload the <i>entire</i> product again.</p>
<p>While I was happy as heck to see installers updated (that makes your post-installation experience a bit nicer imo), I couldn't understand why they didn't release an updater.</p>
<p>Well I'm happy to say Adobe released the update the <strong>right</strong> way. You can now update your Builder directly in the editor itself. To be honest, none of the bug fixes were things that impacted me, but you should check the <a href="http://blogs.coldfusion.com/post.cfm/update-released-for-coldfusion-builder-3">blog post</a> to see if they impact you.</p>
<p>On the off chance you may not know how to check for updates in Eclipse (come on, Eclipse is simple, right?), just go to the Help menu and select <code>Check for Updates</code>.</p>
