<p>I try to keep track of what all the browsers add to their developer tools, but somehow I missed this. In a recent Firefox update, they finally added a &quot;Storage&quot; tab to the developer tools. For some reason, this tab was deselected in my Firefox. I only knew it existed when I opened up the options looking for something else.</p>

<p>Once added, and selected, you will then get the ability to view cookies, IndexedDB databases, and Local and Session Storage. (No WebSQL since Firefox doesn't support it.)</p>

<p>Expanding the IDB section, you can browse the structure of local databases:</p>

<p>And when you click an object store, you will see a list of data. If you click one row, you get details:</p>

<p>This will be very handy for folks working with local data. (And reminds me I need to give my presentation on this topic again!)</p>
<p>p.s. The title of this post says it was the &quot;latest&quot; Firefox that added this but honestly I may have missed it from an earlier update.</p>
