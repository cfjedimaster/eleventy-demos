<h1>Post</h1>

<p>This is definitely not <i>new</i> news, but I wanted to share it with folks who may have missed the myriad other posts as well. As the title says, Lucee was launched as a fork of the Railo project. I haven't used Railo much (typically only when a client requires it), so I don't follow that &quot;world&quot; much, but if you want to know more about the why of it I encourage you to read <a href="http://blog.adamcameron.me/2015/01/lucee.html#more">Adam's announcement post</a> where he has a FAQ about the launch of the whole thing.</p>

<p>You can find out more, and download the bits, at the main site: <a href="http://lucee.org/">http://lucee.org/</a>.</p>
<p>I played with it for a grand total of 10 minutes, just to see how well it works. You can currently download an &quot;Express&quot; edition that allows for unzip and run. If you are like me and a bit unfamiliar with how Railo did things, here are some tips:</p>
<p>First, the port that Lucee will run on is 8888. I'm sure this is documented in some XML file some place but it took me a few minutes to find it. I already logged an ER with them to make the startup script actually <i>say</i> this when it runs.</p>
<p>Second, you can find docs at localhost:8888/lucee/doc/.</p>
<p>If you want to write CFMs and test them, go to the installation folder, then webapps/ROOT. This works just like Adobe ColdFusion - write a CFM, save it, open it in your browser.</p>
<p>So that all involves running it locally, how about finding out more about the project?</p>
<p>As I said above, the main site is:</p>

<p>All in all, an interesting development. Any of my readers playing around with this yet?</p>
