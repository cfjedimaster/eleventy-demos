<p>I kinda remembered this from before, but when I clicked the link I was taken to an obviously abandoned, broken page on Apple.com:</p>

<p>Nothing on that page worked so I was pretty much stuck. I reached out to Adobe (still kinda weird to think of them as someone I <i>don't</i> work for) and got help from Krishna Reddy on the ColdFusion team.

<p>Hopefully this becomes a non-issue for CFB going forward.</p>
