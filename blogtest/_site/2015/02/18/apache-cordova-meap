<p>A few months ago I <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/2014/11/25/Early-Access-to-My-Next-Book-Apache-Cordova-in-Action">announced</a> early access to my Apache Cordova book, &quot;Apache Cordova in Action.&quot; Today the MEAP (Manning Early Access Program) edition of the book was updated to include chapter 6. If you haven't yet checked it out, and don't mind getting in early (I won't call it &quot;rough&quot;, I'll call it &quot;frisky&quot;, yeah, that's it), today may be a great day to pick it up. The released chapters cover:</p>
<!--more-->
<ul>
<li>What is Cordova?</li>
<li>Installing Cordova and the Android SDK</li>
<li>Creating Cordova Projects</li>
<li>Using Plugins to Access Device Features</li>
<li>Mobile Design and User Experience</li>
<li>Considerations when Building Mobile Apps</li>
</ul>
<p>Chapter 7 (testing and debugging) and chapter 8 (writing custom plugins) will be out soon. I'm currently working on the tenth chapter (had to jump a bit) but I'll be wrapping up principal writing by the end of next month.</p>
<p>You can buy the book now via the graphic below. If you don't mind, let me know in the comments what you think!</p>
