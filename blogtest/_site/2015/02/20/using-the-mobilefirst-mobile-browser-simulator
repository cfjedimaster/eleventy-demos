<p>Last week I <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/2015/02/16/working-with-hybrid-applications-and-ibm-mobilefirst">blogged about using hybrid mobile applications</a> with IBM MobileFirst. One of the cooler tools you get with the MobileFirst platform is the <strong>Mobile Browser Simulator</strong> This is a desktop testing tool for your application, acting much like the old Ripple project. It is something better shown than written about so I created a quick video that demonstrates how it works. If you have any questions, just ask them in the comments below!</p>
