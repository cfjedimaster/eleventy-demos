<p>If you are having trouble understanding how to use PhoneGap/Cordova's <a href="http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/4.0.0/config_ref_index.md.html#The%20config.xml%20File">config.xml file</a>, or perhaps just want to see examples of what various options do, please check out Holly Schinsky's excellent new tool: <a href="http://devgirl.org/files/config-app/">Interactive Guide to PhoneGap config.xml</a>.</p>

<p>Her tool lets you browse a config.xml file and see documentation on each and every major feature. Even better, she includes lots of screen shots and animations to give you a visual idea of what certain settings change.</p>
