<p>There is <i>so</i> much to love in this. I love how the opening shot is reminiscent of ANH's landspeeder shot. I love the crashed Star Destroyer. And then things just get better and better. The new Stormtroopers and new Imperial logo (time for a new tattoo!), the new TIE fighters, and more shots of the big bad - Kylo Ren. A new - I think - Star Destroyer type as well. (Seems to have only one shield generator versus two.) And of course - the final shot of Han and Chewie. No - I'm not crying - something just got stuck in my eye. Honest.</p>
<p>Can't. Freaking. Wait.</p>
