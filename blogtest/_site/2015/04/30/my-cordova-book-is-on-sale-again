<p>So a few weeks ago, my publisher ran an awesome deal for my Cordova book and their upcoming Ionic book. Today they are running the same deal. You can pick up <a href="http://www.manning.com/camden/">&quot;Apache Cordova in Action&quot;</a> and <a href="http://www.manning.com/wilken/">&quot;Ionic in Action&quot;</a> both for half off. These are both MEAP versions, which basically mean an &quot;in progress&quot; copy of the book. You get the full ebook when done, and updates while new chapters are released. My book currently has nine chapters available, but I turned in the last chapter a few weeks back so you can expect to see the next three rather soon. (Yes, the end is in sight!) When checking out, use the code <code>dotd043015</code> for your discount.</p>
