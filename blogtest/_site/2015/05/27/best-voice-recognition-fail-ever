<p>So yesterday I flew, or, rather, attempted to fly, since apparently the weather forecast was apocalypse and I didn't now it. I actually made it to Texas, but my flight to Madison was canceled there. American Airlines rang me with a robo call to my Google Voice number, and Google helpfully parsed their audio into text for me:</p>
