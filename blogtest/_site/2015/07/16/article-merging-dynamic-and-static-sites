<p>The Telerik Developer Network has published another article from me: <a href="http://developer.telerik.com/featured/merging-dynamic-and-static-sites/">Merging Dynamic and Static Sites</a>. The impetus behind this article was simple. I've been very interested in Static Site Generators (SSGs) lately but one issue you have with them is the lack of a way for non-technical users to work with them. In this article I create a proof of concept system where a Node.js app within some private customer network can be used to integrate with a SSG and publish to a cloud-based file system. Let me know what you think over on the article.</p>
