The Ionic Market contains Starters (things to help you jump start a new project), plugins, and themes. <!--more--></p>
<p>As an example, I turned my Ionic RSS Reader into a project: <a href="http://market.ionic.io/starters/rssviewer">http://market.ionic.io/starters/rssviewer</a></p>

<p>Market assets are both free and commercial and anyone can submit a resource for the store. As I said, it isn't <i>really</i> released yet, so now is a great time to check it out and provide feedback to the Ionic folks!</p>
