<h1>Post</h1>

<p>Sorry for the lack of posting this week - I'm &quot;Down Under&quot; for some presentations and client meetings and trying my best to stay up past 8PM. I'm mostly losing on that front. Anyway, next week, on September 2nd at 12:00 PM CST, I'm giving a free, online presentation for O'Reilly - <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/pub/e/3438">Static site generators: Why use them and how they work</a>. I'll be explaining why in the heck you would ever consider such a thing, discussing and demonstrating one as an example (<a href="http://harpjs.com">Harp</a>), and then I'll talk about how to add dynamic aspects back in and where you can publish your static sites. This will be thrilling. Seriously. I'll also have some snippets from the yet to be released next Star Wars trailer<sup>*</sup>!</p>
<p><sup>*</sup> This statement may or may not be absolutely true.</p>
