<p>Yesterday I updated to <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js 4</a> and today I noticed problems with two apps, <a href="http://harpjs.com">Harp</a> and <a href="http://ionicframework.com">Ionic</a>. Harp was totally broken but Ionic only had issues with the Gulp script. I tried various things, like uninstalling and reinstalling node-sass and Harp itself, but nothing worked. Finally, I found this bug report:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/sintaxi/harp/issues/436">Error: <code>libsass</code> bindings not found when using iojs</a></p>
<p>I can confirm that by following the steps here I was able to get Harp working, and I reached out to the team at Harp and they said a proper fix will be out very soon. <strong>Update: Harp fixed it.</strong></p>
<p>As for Ionic, it wasn't an issue with Ionic but with gulp-sass. Luckily there is a document on how to fix that too: <a href="https://github.com/dlmanning/gulp-sass/wiki/Update-to-the-latest-Gulp-Sass">Update to the latest Gulp Sass</a>. I can confirm this fixed my issues with Ionic's gulp script.</p>
