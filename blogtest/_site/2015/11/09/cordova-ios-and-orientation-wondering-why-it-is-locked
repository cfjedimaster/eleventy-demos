<h1>Post</h1>

<p>I'm not sure if this is new behavior, but if it isn't, I haven't run into this till last week. I was working on a project with Ionic (<a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/2015/11/05/cordova-demo-apple-tv-hd-video-viewer">Cordova Demo â€“ Apple TV HD Video Viewer</a>) and ran into something odd. When I rotated the device, the orientation did not change. I quickly made a virgin Cordova project to see if I could confirm it there as well - and I did.</p>

<p>I knew that Cordova supports a preference to lock orientation, and I checked my config.xml to ensure there wasn't a &quot;lock&quot; there. Turns out, I was half-wrong.</p>
<p>If you check the docs (<a href="http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/config_ref/index.html">The config.xml File</a>) you'll discover this little tidbit:</p>
<blockquote>
Orientation (string, defaults to <strong>default</strong>): allows you to lock orientation and prevent the interface from rotating in response to changes in orientation. Possible values are default, landscape or portrait. Example:
</blockquote>
<p>Note the &quot;defaults to default&quot; aspect - that's crucial.</p>
<p>A bit later in the doc you then see this:</p>
<blockquote>
For iOS, to specify both portrait & landscape mode you would use the platform specific value all
</blockquote>
<p>So to be clear, for iOS, <code>default</code> is portrait only. For Android, <code>default</code> allows for all orientations. In order for your application to support both (well, all four technically) orientations in iOS, you will want to specifically allow that:</p>
<pre><code class="language-markup">
&lt;platform name="ios"&gt;
    &lt;preference name="Orientation" value="all" /&gt;
&lt;/platform&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Note how the preference is wrapped in a <code>platform</code> tag. Don't forget you can set values just for particular platforms within your config.xml file.</p>
<p>So as always - when I post stuff like this I'm always curious to know if everyone else knew this but me. Let me know in the comments below. Thanks to @riddlerdev in the Ionic Slack for helping me find this last week.</p>
