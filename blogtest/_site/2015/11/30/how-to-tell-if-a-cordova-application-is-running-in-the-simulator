<h1>Post</h1>

<p>Just a quick note here but the most recent <a href="http://cordova.apache.org/news/2015/11/24/plugins-release.html">plugins release</a> included a cool little update to the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/cordova-plugin-device">Device</a> plugin. If you've never used it before, the plugin provides basic information about the app's current working environment, including operating system and device model. In the most recent version, a new property was added: <code>isVirtual</code>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As you can probably guess, this property will tell you if you're running on a simulator or a real device. Now while I wouldn't recommend <i>shipping</i> code that uses this normally, during testing it could be real useful. As an example, here is code that simply toggles what kind of camera should be used - the device camera or the photo gallery:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
var sourceType = device.isVirtual ? Camera.PictureSourceType.PHOTOLIBRARY:Camera.PictureSourceType.CAMERA;
	
navigator.camera.getPicture(picDone, picFail, {
	sourceType: sourceType,
	destinationType:Camera.DestinationType.FILE_URI
});</code></pre>
<p>Not rocket science, but useful. Just to be complete, here is a screen shot of the same code running on my device and simulator.</p>

<p>And if you want, you can grab the source for this demo here: <a href="https://github.com/cfjedimaster/Cordova-Examples/tree/master/checkforsim">https://github.com/cfjedimaster/Cordova-Examples/tree/master/checkforsim</a>.</p>
<p>For folks curious, running this on Genymotion actually shows that it is considered a simulator, not a real device, even though you run it from the command line like a real device. Surprising.</p>
