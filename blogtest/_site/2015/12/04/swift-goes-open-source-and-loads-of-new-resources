<p>Yesterday was a big day for Swift developers - Apple announced the open source release of the Swift language. There's a new home for this initiative, <a href="https://swift.org/">Swift.org</a>, and the complete source for the language is up on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift">https://github.com/apple/swift</a>.</p>

<p>Swift is an interesting language. I learned ObjectiveC about a year or so ago when I was still working for Adobe. I respect the language, but it never felt like one I'd like to use on a day to day basis. I've just played a bit with Swift, and it feels a lot more approachable then ObjectiveC, especially for those of us who may be coming from a web background and have pre-existing knowledge of JavaScript.</p>
<p>By open sourcing Swift, Apple has really broadened the environments where Swift can be used. You could now consider using Swift on the server, which is a powerful combination if you're already using Swift in your mobile application. Having one language for both the front end and back end is pretty darn compelling!</p>
<p>So where does IBM come into play? We've partnered with Apple to help the Swift developer community. You can read more at our developer center:</p>

<p>At the <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/swift/">Swift@IBM</a>, you'll find articles, links, and even cooler, a web-based <a href="http://swiftlang.ng.bluemix.net/?cm_mmc=developerWorks-_-dWdevcenter-_-swift-_-lp">Sandbox</a> that let's you test Swift in your browser:</p>

<p>Make sure you use the drop down on the upper left side to try out the different samples. I missed that at first. XCode itself provides a way to test code, but I found this web-based sandbox a lot easier to use.</p>
<p>In 2016, I plan on focusing on two things - Node.js and Swift. I had already planned on this before the announcement, but this move by Apple just cements my choice.</p>
<p>Finally, for a good perspective on this announcement and what it means for development, I suggest this article: <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/swift/2015/12/03/swift-moves-to-open-source-a-development-perspective/">https://developer.ibm.com/swift/2015/12/03/swift-moves-to-open-source-a-development-perspective/</a></p>
