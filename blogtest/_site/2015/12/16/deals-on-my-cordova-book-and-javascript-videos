<p>Just a quick note to let folks know about two deals regarding my content. First, you can get <strong>half</strong> off of my <a href="http://www.manning.com/camden">Apache Cordova</a> book with the following code: dotd121615au. Other books are included in that deal including their <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/ionic-in-action">Ionic book</a>.</p>
<p>The other deal I want to share is that two of my JavaScript videos (JavaScript Templating and Client-Side Data Storage) are now bundled in a larger collection called <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/category/learning-path/intro-modern-front-end-web.do?imm_mid=0ddc40&cmp=em-web-books-videos-lp-promo_lp_modern_frontend_web_20151216">Introduction to the Modern Front-End Web</a>. This bundle includes 5 different videos and over 10 hours of content for just 99 dollars. That's virtually free! (Ok, maybe not...)</p>
