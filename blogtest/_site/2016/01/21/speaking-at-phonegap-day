<p>I'm a bit late on announcing this, but next week I'll be speaking at the 2016 <a href="http://pgday.phonegap.com/us2016/">PhoneGap Day</a> in Lehi, Utah. Unfortunately tickets are sold out, but if get a chance to attend next year, I highly recommend it. PhoneGap Day is an
incredibly casual, fun, and just plain exciting way to learn more about Apache Cordova and hybrid mobile development. There's also a full day of deep workshops before the event where you can learn both basics and advanced topics. This year I'm giving a presentation
concerning internationalization of data and I hope folks find it useful.</p>
<p>While the US PhoneGap Day is sold out, the <a href="http://pgday.phonegap.com/eu2016/">European one</a> in Amsterdam is <em>not</em> sold out.</p>
