<p>Nothing much to say here really except that I've released another article for the
<a href="http://developer.telerik.com/">Telerik Developer Network</a> - <a href="http://developer.telerik.com/featured/leveling-up-your-javascript/">&quot;Leveling Up Your JavaScript&quot;</a>.</p>
<p>As you can probably guess, the article discusses how to improve your JavaScript skills. This is not meant to replace any of the good books out there. Rather, this is a high level view at what helped <em>me</em> improve my own skills. It is focused on a few specific strategies that I found useful for becoming a better developer.</p>
<p>And to be clear - I'm talking about a &quot;better developer&quot;, not a &quot;great&quot; developer or heck, even &quot;good&quot; - just better. Becoming better at JavaScript (and web development in general) has been a fun, and sometimes painful, process. So I've tried to provide some guidance as to what worked well for me. Obviously these tips may not work for you, but I hope they provide some useful suggestions for you.</p>
<p>Please let me know what you think in the comments on the article!</p>
