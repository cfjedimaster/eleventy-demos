<p>Just a quick note to let folks know I'll be speaking at <a href="https://devnexus.com/s/index">DevNexus</a> in ten days. I'm giving a presentation on <a href="http://www.ionicframework.com">Ionic</a> services and will also be covering my coworker <a href="http://www.tricedesigns.com/">Andy Trice</a>'s presentation on cognitive computing and mobile applications.</p>
<p>Unfortunately it looks like the conference is already sold out, but if you're attending and read this blog, please come by and say hello. I'll be bringing a copy of my last two books with me and will pretty much give them out to the first person who asks for them. Hope to see you there!</p>
