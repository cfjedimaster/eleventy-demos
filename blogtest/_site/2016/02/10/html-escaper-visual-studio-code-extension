<p>Just a quick note to say I've released a new extension for <a href="http://code.visualstudio.com">Visual Studio Code</a>. This extension simply takes a document and outputs an escaped version of it appropriate for blog posts
or other online forums. This is basically the same thing I built for Brackets, but it wasn't possible for
Visual Studio Code until the release this month. Here's an example of how it looks.</p>

<p>The code I used was based on a simple example made by Erich Gamma of Microsoft. Shoot, 90% of the code is his and I just modified the bare minimum to create my extension. You can find my code here (<a href="https://github.com/cfjedimaster/htmlescape-vscode">https://github.com/cfjedimaster/htmlescape-vscode</a> and you can install it directly within Visual Studio Code itself. You can also download the packaged version
from the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=raymondcamden.htmlescape-vscode-extension">gallery</a> as well.</p>
