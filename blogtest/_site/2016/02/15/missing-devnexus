<h1>Post</h1>

<p>So yeah, the title says it all. Due to a family issue, I had to cancel my speaking engagement at
<a href="http://www.devnexus.com">DevNexus</a> this year. The good news is that my session on Ionic Services
is being covered by a member of the Ionic team, Mike Hartington. That's about the best kind of replacement
you can get.</p>
<p>For folks who want to learn more about Ionic services, I'd be happy to give a Google Hangout presentation online sometime next week. If I can get at least two people to comment and say they would attend, that's enough for me to take an hour out of my day and stream a quick presentation.</p>
<p>As an aside, the 'family issue' is a <em>good</em> one and isn't anything to be concerned about. (And no, it doesn't involve me flying to China again.)</p>
<p>My next presentation will be at FluentConf where I'll be <a href="http://conferences.oreilly.com/fluent/javascript-html-us">speaking</a> on StrongLoop.</p>
