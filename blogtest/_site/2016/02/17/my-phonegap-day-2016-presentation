<p>I was honored to be chosen to speak at this year's <a href="http://pgday.phonegap.com/us2016/">PhoneGap Day</a>, but honestly, even if I wasn't chosen to speak, I would have tried like heck to get there. I missed last year, but every PhoneGap Day I've been too has been <em>incredible</em>. If you missed it, all of the presentations will be available online via the <a href="http://pgday.phonegap.com/us2016/">PhoneGap blog</a>. You can also read their
excellent <a href="http://phonegap.com/blog/2016/02/09/recapping-phonegap-day-us-2016/">recap</a> of the event too.</p>
<p>My session is available now, and you can watch it below.</p>

<p>In my session, I talked a bit about one of the things PhoneGap/Cordova developers need to keep in mind - internationalization. My focus was specifically on number and date formatting (hey, I only had twenty minutes!) and I demonstrated how you can use the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/cordova-plugin-globalization">Globalization</a> plugin to achieve this.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about what I demonstrated, just leave me a comment below!</p>
