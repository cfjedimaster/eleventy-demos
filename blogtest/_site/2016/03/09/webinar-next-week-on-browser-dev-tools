<p>Just a quick note to let folks know I'll be giving a webinar next week on browser dev tools. This will be for the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/nvcfug/">Northern Virginia ColdFusion Users Group</a> but will be open to the public. If you can't make it, it will be up on YouTube afterwards and I'll post the link back to this blog post.</p>
<p>This session will introduce the basics of using the browser's developer tools to help you debug/test your web applications. Most likely this will only be appropriate for beginning developers but all are welcome.</p>
<p>Here are the details:</p>
