<p>This is just a FYI that there is a cool little project that provides XPath like support for JSON values: <a href="https://github.com/s3u/JSONPath">JSONPath Plus</a>. I think this is rather cool as XPath is probably the only nice thing about XML over JSON. If you've never heard of XPath, you can think of it as a query language for filtering/parsing XML data. Everything from getting a subset of an XML document to even doing things like addition. If you'd like to learn more, check out the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XPath">MDN documentation</a> on XPath. JSON doesn't provide any similar functionality built-in, but JSONPath provides an alternative.</p>

<p>Here is an example of it in action. Let's take the result of calling the Ships API from the <a href="https://swapi.co">Star Wars API</a>. The URL for this JSON is http://swapi.co/api/starships/?format=json. Here is the result - with some of the results taken out just to make the snippet a bit smaller.</p>

<p>Just by eyeballing that<sup>*</sup> you can see the object contains a count key, a next and previous set of keys for pagination, and a results array. Using JSONPath, I can request just the result by using this path: <code>$.results</code>. Or I could ask for the total sum of the cost values like so: <code>$.results..cost_in_credits</code>.</p>
<p>Pretty cool, right? The <a href="https://github.com/s3u/JSONPath">readme</a> contains many examples. You can use this both in 'regular' client-side JavaScript as well as Node. I wanted to do some testing with the library so I built a quick online demo. Here's a screen shot in action. I used <em>all</em> my design skills on this one:</p>

<p>While JSONPath itself has a few configuration options, my tool simply takes the defaults. You can paste in a JSON string and then play around with the path options to see the results.</p>

<p>My code isn't anything special here - basically take in the inputs and render them out. I'll remind folks that JSON.stringify lets you pass in basic formatting instructions. That's how I got the nicely layout dump of the data. You can try out the demo here: <a href="https://static.raymondcamden.com/demos/2016/03/15/">https://static.raymondcamden.com/demos/2016/03/15/</a>.</p>
<p>* As a quick aside, I've been using this <a href="http://jsonviewer.stack.hu/">online JSON viewer</a> for a while now to render complex JSON objects. I need to build an extension for Visual Studio Code so I can use this in my editor.</p>
