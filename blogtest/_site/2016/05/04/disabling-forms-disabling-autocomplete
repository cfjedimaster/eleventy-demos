<h1>Post</h1>

<p>This isn't going to be the most important tip I've ever shared here, but as it is annoys the you know what out of me, I thought I'd share. I fill out a lot of forms, and one of the first things I do on a form is double click in the first field to give autocomplete a chance to fill in as many fields as possible. Unfortunately, sometimes this isn't possible because the site creator, for whatever reason (maybe even a good one) decided to disable this.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Autocomplete can be disabled at both the form level and the field level. To disable it for the entire form, you would do:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
&lt;form action="iwantyoutowastetimeenteringcrap" method="post" autocomplete="off"&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>To disable it on a field by field basis, you would simply use the same attribute in the field itself:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
&lt;input type="text" name="iwantyoutotype" autocomplete="off"&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>As I said, maybe you have a good reason for this. <a href="http://www.wufoo.com">Wufoo</a> seems to do this by default for their forms. However, this bothers me. I'm seeing it being used in forms that have nothing necessarily private/secure in them and it just annoys me. So here is a 30-second video showing how to quickly get around it in Chrome's Dev Tools. You can do the exact same thing in your browser of choice.</p>

<p>Now if I could only apply autocomplete to all the various medical forms that require me to enter the same information multiple times my life would be complete.</p>
<p>p.s. As another tip - please don't ask for someone's birthday and their age. You don't need both.</p>
