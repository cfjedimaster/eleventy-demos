<p>For the past month or so I've been fighting against a jerk auto-copying my content to their Blogger blog (<a href="https://www.raymondcamden.com/2016/07/15/fighting-against-a-content-stealer-on-blogger/">Fighting against a content stealer on Blogger</a>). After <em>constant</em> complaining on Twitter (sorry!), I finally reached a few folks who were able to escalate the issue and take down the blog.</p>

<p>I'm happy it's gone, but it still bothers me that Blogger was a complete wall of silence on the issue. They took down every URL I sent in via DCMA notice, but they couldn't bother to respond to me personally one time. I'm sure they get swamped with these notices, but after I sent in over 400 URLs, I would think I could have gotten <em>something</em> from them.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, I think the only reason I got this fixed was because of my large Twitter following and contacts I have at Google. Anyone else probably would have been SOL.</p>
<p><em>sigh</em></p>
<p>At the of the day, it's over, and the blog is dead, and I'll chalk that up to a win!</p>
