<p>This is the video recording of my talk at ForwardJS - Bringing Dynamic Back. It's about adding dynamic aspects (comments, search, etc) to static web sites. I'm covering this much deeper in my next book (<a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920051879.do">&quot;Working with Static Sites&quot;</a>) which you can preorder now. (Not sure what the final release date will be but it's about 75% done currently.)</p>
