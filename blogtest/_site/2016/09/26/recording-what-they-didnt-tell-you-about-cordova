<p>For those who couldn't make the <a href="http://ncdevcon.com/">NCDevCon</a> (which is a shame, it is a great conference!), here is the recording of my presentation on Apache Cordova and &quot;things they didn't tell you.&quot; As I say right away in the beginning, everything I cover are <em>absolutely</em> things that folks talk about now, but it's sometimes missed in the rush to get things done quickly.</p>
<p>As always, I love your feedback and questions, just ask in the comment below.</p>

<p>Warning - it requires Adobe Flash.</p>
