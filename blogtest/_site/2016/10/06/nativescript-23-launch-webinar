<p>Next week (October 13 at 10AM CST) I'll be on a panel with TJ VanToll and Burke Holland of Progress to talk about the latest release of NativeScript. Mainly this will be them showing stuff off and me commenting and asking questions. As folks know, I'm primarily a Cordova person, but I've been playing with NativeScript and I'm really interested in what it has to offer. This is online, and free, but space is limited to sign up now:</p>
