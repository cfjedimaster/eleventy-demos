<h1>Post</h1>

<p>Forgive the somewhat late notice, but I'll be speaking next week at <a href="https://www.ortussolutions.com/odw">Ortus Developer Week</a>, a 100% free, online conference run by the fine folks at Ortus Solutions.</p>
<!--more--> 
<p>While primarily a ColdFusion-related conference, you'll find some non-CF topics there as well. My topic is <a href="https://www.ortussolutions.com/odw/sessions/77">&quot;Going Static&quot;</a> and I'll be discussing one of my favorite topics - static web sites. My talk is at 11AM CST, Monday the 14th.</p>
