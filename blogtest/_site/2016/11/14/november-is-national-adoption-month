<p>Every year (sometimes sooner than later), I remind folks that November is national Adoption Month. My wife and I have been blessed to have formed our family via international adoption. We have three kids adopted from South Korea and three from China. It is an incredible process. Beautiful, scary, difficult, rewarding, a mix of everything you would expect in bringing a new life into your family. If you've never considered adoption before, then now is a perfect time to start thinking about it.</p>
<p>You can begin at <a href="https://adoption.com/">Adoption.com</a>. Also check out <a href="https://www.adopttogether.org/">AdoptTogether</a> - a new site that helps crowdfund adoptions. I was introduced to this site by a friend recently and it looks like a great way to help support the financial burden of adoptions. You can learn more about the idea by watching this video:</p>

<p>I'd be happy to help answer any questions about the adoption process (although my experience is only with international adoption, not domestic). Just leave me a comment below or if you would rather talk privately, hit up my contact form.</p>
