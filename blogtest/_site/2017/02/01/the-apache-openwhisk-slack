<p>This is just a quick note (since I know not everyone uses Twitter, and lately, I've been trying my best to avoid it) to let
folks know that there is an official Slack org for folks working with Apache OpenWhisk: openwhisk-team.slack.com</p>
<p>You can sign up for it here: http://slack.openwhisk.org</p>
