<p>This is just a quick reminder that the <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/openwhisk/">OpenWhisk</a> CLI tool updates often, and unfortunately, doesn't provide a warning when it has become out of date. I've yet to see things break, of course, but obviously as a developer you want to ensure you have the latest and greatest installed.</p>
<p>First - you can get information about your install by running <code>wsk property get</code>:</p>

<p>You can see the CLI version highlighted above. You can compare this against the binaries hosted here:</p>
<p>https://openwhisk.ng.bluemix.net/cli/go/download/</p>
<p>Just today I saw a newer version was released. I downloaded the binary, copied it over, and verified the update:</p>

<p>Kinda icky for those of us used to doing everything via <code>npm</code>, but hopefully it will get a bit nicer in the future. With OpenWhisk stuff updating rapdily, I've been checking for updates once a week or so.</p>
<p>p.s. And as a total random aside, those screenshots are from the Windows Bash Unix subsystem which is running <em>really</em> freaking good.</p>
