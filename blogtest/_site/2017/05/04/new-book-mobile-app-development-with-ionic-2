<p>Yep, a brand-spanking new book on the latest version of Ionic by <a href="https://chrisgriffith.wordpress.com/">Chris Griffith</a>. I had the distinct pleasure of being one of the technical reviewers for this book and I enjoyed it quite a lot. I felt like I &quot;knew&quot; Ionic 2 going in, but obviously didn't know everything, and I definitely discovered some great new tips while editing. I also really like Chris' use of one main sample application throughout the book. The reader really gets a chance to see it grow and expand with new features. Pick it up by clicking the link below (and yep, that's an affiliate link so if you buy, I get a few cents, thanks!)</p>
