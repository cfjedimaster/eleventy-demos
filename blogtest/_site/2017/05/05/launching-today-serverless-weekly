<h1>Post</h1>

<p>The title says it all. I've been a fan of the <a href="https://cooperpress.com/">Cooperpress</a> weeklies for sometime now and I'm happy to say I'm helping them launch a new one - <a href="https://serverless.email/">Serverless Status</a>. (Yeah, I called it &quot;Serverless Weekly&quot; above, but you get the idea. ;) As with the other weeklies, this a free newsletter providing interesting links concerning serverless stuff. This will include blog posts, demos, product announcements and more. I'll be contributing to it, so feel free to DM or @ me suggestions.</p>
<p>You can sample the content (and sign up) now at https://serverless.email.</p>
