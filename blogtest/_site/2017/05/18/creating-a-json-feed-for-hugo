<p><em>Edit on 3/26/2018 to fix tags, thanks to commenter Carl</em> Recently a new specification was launched to recreate RSS in JSON, <a href="https://jsonfeed.org">JSON Feed</a>. For folks who may not be aware, RSS is an XML spec (well, multiple ones) for sharing content between sites. Blogs, primarily, and content-heavy sites typically make use of this. I'm not sure how many people outside of developers actually <em>use</em> RSS, but it's still definitely a &quot;thing&quot; even if you don't necessarily think of it when thinking about APIs.</p>
<p>The idea behind JSON Feed is to simply recreate the same, or similar, functionality in JSON as opposed to XML. You can read more about the launch on their <a href="https://jsonfeed.org/2017/05/17/announcing_json_feed">announcement post</a> and read the full <a href="https://jsonfeed.org/version/1">spec</a> as well. (And actually, this is one of the better written specs I've seen. You won't need a PhD in CompSci to grok it.)</p>
<p>I thought it might be fun to build a JSON feed for my Hugo site. I ran into some trouble getting the JSON output working right and want to thank @bep for <a href="https://discuss.gohugo.io/t/output-formats-any-help-yet/6611/9">helping me out</a> on the forums. I based my solution on a new Hugo feature, <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/output-formats/">Output Formats</a>, but obviously I may have done this in a completely stupid manner as well. As always, I encourage folks to leave me a comment and let me know what could be improved.</p>
<p>ALright, so to begin, I created a file in <code>/content</code> called <code>jsonfeed.md</code>. This file is empty and just serves as a way to tell Hugo where to create the feed.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">{
	"outputs":["json"],
	"layout":"feed"
}

</code></pre>
<p>Note that I'm specifying json as my output and I'm saying my layout will be the feed template. That's where the real work takes place:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">{
    "version": "https://jsonfeed.org/version/1",
    "title": "{{ .Site.Title }}",
    "home_page_url": "{{ .Site.BaseURL }}",
    "feed_url": "{{ .Permalink}}",
	{{ if isset .Site.Params "description" }}
	"description": "{{ .Site.Params.description }}",
	{{ end }}
	{{ if isset .Site.Params "author" }}
	"author": { "name": "{{ .Site.Params.author }}" },
	{{ end }}
    "items": [
    {{ range $i, $e := first 10 .Site.Pages }}
		{{ if $i }}, {{ end }}
			{
				"id": "{{ .Permalink }}",
				"title": "{{ .Title }}",
				"content_text": {{ .Summary | jsonify }},
				"url": "{{ .Permalink }}",
				"date_published": "{{ .Date }}",
				"tags": ["{{ delimit .Params.tags "," }}"]
			}
		{{ end }}
    ]
}
</code></pre>
<p>Most of this should make sense I think - but let me call out some particular aspects. First, I've made description and author both optional based on whether or not the user has this in their Hugo settings.</p>
<p>In the range call, I had to use slightly weird syntax to support &quot;include a comma except for the last iteration.&quot; This syntax makes zero sense to me, but I copied it from another support post by @bep located <a href="https://discuss.gohugo.io/t/conditional-behavior-in-template-if-last-array-item-was-found/1270">here</a>. Even though the internal <code>if</code> with the comma is at the top, it renders at the bottom. Yeah, ok.</p>
<p>As for each item, for the most part it just plain works as shown. Hugo summaries are plain text only so I used <code>content_text</code> instead of <code>content_html</code>. I run it through a pipe to make it safe for JSON. For tags, I was a bit torn. Hugo supports both categories and tags, and in theory you could use both I guess. Or just categories. I used tags just to keep it simple, but that's definitely something you would want to look into for your own Hugo site.</p>
<p>Finally, the date one rendered a bit weird on my blog. Let's look at the output to see the full response (I removed a bunch of items to make it shorter):</p>

<p>Notice the double <code>-0700 -0700</code>? I'm pretty sure that's just an issue on my blog due to how I specify dates in my posts. I probably did it wrong, but with near 6000 posts, I'm not changing it. For my fix, I switched up the above code to:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">"date_published": "{{ replace .Date "-0700 -0700" "-0700"}}",
</code></pre>
<p>And that's it. As I said, there's probably a better way of doing this, and I honestly don't know if anyone is going to even make use of JSON Feed, but if folks want mine, they can find it at https://www.raymondcamden.com/jsonfeed/index.json</p>
