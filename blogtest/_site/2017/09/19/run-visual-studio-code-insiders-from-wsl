<p>A quick tip that is 100% thanks to the <a href="https://twitter.com/code">Visual Studio Code twitter</a> account. For a while now I've been able to run Visual Studio Code from WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) by simply doing <code>code .</code> in the directory I'm working in. However, a few months ago I switched to the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders">Insiders</a> build. I was hesitant to do so as it seemed like it would be risky, but after one of Microsoft's engineers assured me it was safe I gave it a try.</p>
<p>I think in the last few months I've seen one case where a bug was introduced that forced me back to the &quot;regular&quot; Code for a few days. Outside of that I've enjoyed getting the new features earlier and it is now my primary editor. (And to be clear, you can absolutely have <em>both</em> installed, and running, at the same time.)</p>
<p>However, I noticed recently I wasn't able to run the Insiders editor from within WSL. I could still run <code>code</code>, but nothing worked for the Insiders build. After asking about this on Twitter, I got this:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">You probably need to add the \bin path to your .bash_rc or PATH</p>&mdash; Visual Studio Code (@code) <a href="https://twitter.com/code/status/910264600385396736">September 19, 2017</a></blockquote>

<p>Duh. I did a quick <code>echo $PATH</code> and saw that Code's path was available, but not Insiders. I hadn't even noticed it, but WSL automatically includes your Windows PATH setting into the Bash shell, so to fix this, I simply added it there. Another nice surprise (one I found a few months ago), is that Windows made editing your path a heck of a lot easier.</p>

<p>So - I added it - fired up a new Ubuntu shell - and bam, I could run <code>code-insiders .</code> and it worked right away. Note that if you do this under a Ubuntu directory, Insiders won't be able to view the files. But if you open it open <code>/mnt/c</code> (or lower) then Insiders correctly loads the proper Windows directory. I'll probably also make an alias so I can type fewer characters. I have a confession to make though. As much as I love using WSL I'm still very much new to Bash stuff.</p>
