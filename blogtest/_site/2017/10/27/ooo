<h1>Post</h1>

<p>Just a quick note that I'm going to be OOO (Out of Office) for an extended period. My response times to emails will be quite a bit slower and I probably won't be blogging. Things will return to normal in 2 weeks.</p>
<p>Normally I let social media know about my blog posts to help drive traffic, but obviously there's no real reason to do that for this one. However, if you are a regular reader who comes here just to see what's new, do me a favor and say hi below. I'd appreciate a bit of validation that this blog is actually reaching people who care. ;)</p>
