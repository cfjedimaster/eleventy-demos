<p>I'm happy to announce the release of my latest Lynda.com course, <a href="https://www.lynda.com/Node-js-tutorials/Welcome/630621/689210-4.html">Building APIs with LoopBack</a>. This course introduces you to <a href="https://loopback.io/">LoopBack</a> and walks you through building APIs as well as a sample application using those APIs. I cover customizations, security, and more. It's near two hours in length and would be a great way to learn the framework. You do <em>not</em> need to be an expert in Node to use LoopBack, so I definitely recommend it. I hope my readers find this useful, and as always, leave me some feedback about the course either at the site or down in the comments below. (As a reminder, I also have a <a href="https://www.lynda.com/Ionic-tutorials/Learning-Ionic-Basics/562925-2.html">course on Ionic</a> as well!)</p>
<p>Here is the course outline:</p>
