<h1>Post</h1>

<p>So yesterday I <a href="https://www.raymondcamden.com/2018/01/16/generating-random-cure-song-titles/">blogged</a> a demo that was - by my own admission - somewhat silly and not really worth your time to read. However, I was thinking later that there was one particular aspect of how I built that demo that may be actually be useful.</p>
<p>While I was creating the demo, I needed to get a list of all the songs the Cure recorded. I found this quickly enough on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:The_Cure_songs">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.raymondcamden.com/images/2018/1/dtcure1.jpg" alt="Screen shot of Wikipedia page"></p>
<p>So there's only 67 songs there - in theory I could have typed that in about 5 minutes. But why do something by hand when you can use code?!?!?</p>
<p>I began by right clicking on the first link and selecting &quot;Inspect Element.&quot; (As a quick FYI, I'm using Firefox for this, but everything I'm showing should work in every modern browser. And shoot - I just tested and it's not supported in Edge. Tsk tsk.)</p>
<p><img src="https://static.raymondcamden.com/images/2018/1/dtcure2.jpg" alt="Screen shot of devtools focused on the link tag"></p>
<p>It may be a bit hard to see in the screen shot, but I noticed two things here. First, the link used a <code>title</code> attribute with the name of the song. Second, I noticed there was a div named <code>mw-category</code> that appeared to &quot;wrap&quot; all the links. I figured this out by mousing over the div in the Inspector panel and noticing the highlight above.</p>

<p>Cool. So now I switched to the Console. For my first command, I wanted to grab all the links within that div:</p>
<pre><code>links = document.querySelectorAll('.mw-category a');
</code></pre>
<p>When it was done, I tested to see if it seemed right by checking the length:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.raymondcamden.com/images/2018/1/dtcure4.jpg" alt="Confirming I got the right data"></p>
<p>Notice how I got 67 items and it matches what the Wikipedia page says as well. Cool! So, now I've got a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NodeList">NodeList</a> of data that I can iterate over like an array. (It <em>isn't</em> an array, but I can use it as such.) So first I made a new array:</p>
<pre><code>titles = [];
</code></pre>
<p>And then I populated it:</p>
<pre><code>links.forEach((a) =&gt; titles.push(a.title));
</code></pre>
<p>And when done, I took a quick look to ensure it seemed ok:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.raymondcamden.com/images/2018/1/dtcure5.jpg" alt="Testing the titles value"></p>
<p>Cool! And for the final operation, I simply copied it to my clipboard using:</p>
<pre><code>copy(titles)
</code></pre>
<p>This is the only part that is not supported by Edge. Hopefully they add that soon. The end result is a string version of the array I was able to drop right into my editor and go to town with.</p>
<p>If any of the following didn't make sense, I've created a quick video showing the process I went through.</p>
