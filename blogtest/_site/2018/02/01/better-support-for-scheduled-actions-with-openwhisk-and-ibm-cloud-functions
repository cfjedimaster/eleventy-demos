<p>For a while now (certainly for as long as I've been using it), OpenWhisk/IBM Cloud Functions has had one main way to handle &quot;scheduled&quot; action invocations, the <a href="https://console.bluemix.net/docs/openwhisk/openwhisk_alarms.html#openwhisk_catalog_alarm">Alarm</a> package. In order to this feature you would use the <code>alarm</code> feed (part of the alarm package, yes, both share the same name) and specify a CRON string for your schedule.</p>
<p>That works well. But CRON is... well, CRON is a very powerful and flexible system that looks like it was designed by the same people who created regular expressions. I know I can do anything I want with CRON but I absolutely hate doing everything with it.</p>
<p>The good news is that now there is a better way! The Alarm package has a new feed called <code>interval</code>. The <code>interval</code> feed takes (among others) a parameter that specifies the number of minutes to wait between calls. So if you want an action to run every hour? 60. Want it to run once a day? 1440. And that's it. The <code>interval</code> action also supports an optional <code>startDate</code> and <code>stopDate</code> parameter to let you specify a particular date range for the trigger.</p>
<p>So an example, consider this CRON based trigger:</p>
<pre><code>wsk trigger create periodic \
	--feed /whisk.system/alarms/alarm \
	--param cron &quot;*/2 * * * *&quot; \
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>interval</code> version of this would be:</p>
<pre><code>wsk trigger create periodic \
	--feed /whisk.system/alarms/interval \
	--param minutes 2 \
</code></pre>
<p>I don't know about you, but that's a heck of a lot easier to understand. Of course, CRON does offer more complex support, so for example, running only on certain days, but frankly I'd rather write a line of JavaScript to exit early than spend an hour trying to get the CRON syntax right and hoping I didn't screw it up.</p>
<p>Also note there is another new feed in this package - <code>once</code>. This feed takes an argument named date and will only fire one time. Previously developers used the alarm feed and used the <code>maxTriggers</code> parameter with a value of 1. This is now deprecated (and that will be documented shortly) and <code>once</code> should be used instead.</p>
<p>I don't think you need to update your existing OpenWhisk actions to change to either of these, but certainly going forward you may want to consider using <code>interval</code> instead.</p>
