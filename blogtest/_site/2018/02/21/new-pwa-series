<h1>Post</h1>

<p>This is just an FYI, but I'm currently writing a series on PWAs (Progressive Web Apps) for Telerik. You can always find my list of external articles on my <a href="/about">About Me</a> page. So far I've got two articles in the series published and the third one is almost wrapped.</p>
<p>Part one is: <a href="https://www.telerik.com/blogs/a-gentle-and-practical-introduction-to-progressive-web-apps">A Gentle and Practical Introduction to Progressive Web Apps</a>.</p>
<p>Part two is: <a href="https://www.telerik.com/blogs/gentle-and-practical-introduction-to-progressive-web-apps-part-2">A Gentle and Practical Introduction to Progressive Web Apps - Part 2</a></p>
<p>You get zero chances to guess what the third one will be called. ;) While I'm still kinda new to PWAs, I hope these articles can help others learn more about them. As always, I'm open to suggestions on improvements, but please post any comments about the articles over on the Telerik site.</p>
