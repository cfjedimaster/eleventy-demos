<p>My buddy Brian Rinaldi has been running free online developer meetings over the past few months at <a href="http://certifiedfreshevents.com/">Certified Fresh Events</a>. Last night he announced a new event, <a href="https://certifiedfreshevents.com/events/knowjs-2018/">KnowJS</a>. This is an <em>all day</em> online event featuring four of the best speakers in the JavaScript community - Kyle Simpson, Bianca Gandolfo, Brian Holt, and Kent Dodds. The event will be held on April 13 and tickets are limited to 50 seats. You'll be able to rewatch the talks at any time later. If you can't make the event, Brian will be selling access to the recorded content at a later date.</p>
<p>So if it isn't clear, I <em>strongly</em> recommend signing up for this event. I definitely think it's worth the cost and folks of any skill level should walk away with a huge amount of new knowledge!</p>
