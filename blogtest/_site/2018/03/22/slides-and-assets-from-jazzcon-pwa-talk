<p>The title says it all. If you were in my JazzCon talk earlier on PWAs, here are my slides:</p>
<iframe src="//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/zktNfOrQnBl6J4" width="595" height="485" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" style="border:1px solid #CCC; border-width:1px; margin-bottom:5px; max-width: 100%;" allowfullscreen> </iframe> <div style="margin-bottom:5px"> <strong> <a href="//www.slideshare.net/raymondcamden/building-a-pwa-for-everyone-who-is-scared-to" title="Building a PWA - For Everyone Who Is Scared To" target="_blank">Building a PWA - For Everyone Who Is Scared To</a> </strong> from <strong><a href="https://www.slideshare.net/raymondcamden" target="_blank">Raymond Camden</a></strong> </div>
<p>You can download the code here: <a href="https://static.raymondcamden.com/enclosures/demosjazzcon.zip">demosjazzcon.zip</a>. As an FYI, the reason the second demo failed was due to my using the PlaceCat service which is no longer around. My code to fetch and cache it failed and I didn't have code to handle that error. A good mistake to have and something I can learn from!</p>
