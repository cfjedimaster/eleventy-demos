<p>I wasn't able to make this year's <a href="http://us.vuejs.org/">VueConf US</a> (even though it was in my backyard), but luckily, some of the videos from the conference are online:</p>
<p>https://www.vuemastery.com/conferences/vueconf-2018/opening-keynote-evan-you</p>
<p>Right now there's just 4 sessions, but they are <em>incredibly</em> good presentations including Rachel Nabor's on <a href="https://www.vuemastery.com/conferences/vueconf-2018/vue-in-motion-rachel-nabors">Vue's transition</a> support for animations and Edd Yerburgh on <a href="https://www.vuemastery.com/conferences/vueconf-2018/testing-vue-apps-edd-yerburgh">testing Vue apps</a>.</p>
<p>While at the site, take note of the &quot;Notify me&quot; button on the right. You can sign up there to be notified when new videos are added. From what I know, <em>all</em> the videos will be available eventually. Plus, if you sign up, the fine folks at <a href="https://www.vuemastery.com/">Vue Mastery</a> will send you a Vue PDF cheat sheet that is <em>really</em> freaking nice:</p>

<p>It's two pages in length and I'm probably going to print it out for my home office. Actually disregard what I said above. If you don't feel like signing up for updates, you can still get the PDF here: https://www.vuemastery.com/pdf/Vue-Essentials-Cheat-Sheet.pdf. As I said, it is definitely worth downloading!</p>
