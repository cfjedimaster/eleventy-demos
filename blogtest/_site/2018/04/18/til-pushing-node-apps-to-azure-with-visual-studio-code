<h1>Post</h1>

<p>I've been playing, off and on, with Microsoft Azure for a while now. My main focus has been on the services areas (see my <a href="https://www.raymondcamden.com/2017/06/15/testing-multiple-image-recognition-services-at-once/">post</a> comparing different visual recognition services) but I was also curious to see how well it worked as a PaaS for Node apps. About two or three months ago I tried to push a simple <a href="https://loopback.io/">LoopBack</a> app up and I was not successful. I put the blame on me for not reading the docs well, but it wasn't a good experience. About a week or so ago I was talking to a Microsoft employee about deployment in general and when I mentioned my last experience, he pointed me to this great tutorial:</p>
<h3><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/tutorials/app-service-extension/getting-started">Deploy to Azure using App Service</a></h3>
<p>This tutorial walks you through the process of installing the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azureappservice">Azure App Service</a> extension into Visual Studio Code and then using it to deploy a Node app to Azure.</p>
<p>I'm not going to repeat what's in the tutorial as it generally just works fine as is. I will warn you about a few things you may run into while testing.</p>
<p>First, when you begin the authentication process, it will ask you to open a URL and enter a code:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.raymondcamden.com/images/2018/04/azurepin2.jpg" alt="Azure prompt"></p>
<p>Do NOT click! If you do, the little panel there will disappear, and if your memory is like mine, you won't remember the code. I had to quit VSC and restart it to get the prompt again. You can select text in the dialog and put it in your clipboard, or just jot it down.</p>
<p><strong>Oops!</strong> So notice how in the screenshot above it says Copy. As in, um, Copy, like Ray, how could you miss that? Yep, that's all on me. I think maybe I was expecting it to pre-fill the form field with the code. Either way - just paste. Duh.</p>
<p>Secondly, for me the first deployment was incredibly slow. I'd say about ten minutes. Maybe LoopBack is big (honestly I never really thought about it). Maybe it was provisioning things. But for whatever reason, that first push was definitely slow. <em>However</em>, after that it moved incredibly quick. I'd say maybe 30 seconds, or quicker, to get the app updated.</p>
<p>Finally, the extension supports <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/tutorials/app-service-extension/tailing-logs">viewing logs</a> from your application. That's cool, but it didn't always consistently work for me. That being said, last night when I was testing I was having a bit of trouble with it and this morning it seems to be working perfectly fine.</p>

<p>Finally, and a bit off topic, but if you develop Visual Studio Code extensions, check out this button from the guide:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.raymondcamden.com/images/2018/04/azure3.jpg" alt="Install button"></p>
<p>Clicking this will open Visual Studio Code right to the marketplace and the extension. It's just a properly formatted URL but I was surprised to see it work so well. (Obviously you would need VSC installed for it to work properly.) Like any good webdev I did a quick Inspect Element to see the URL: vscode:extension/ms-azuretools.vscode-azureappservice. I'm surprised I don't see that used more often.</p>
