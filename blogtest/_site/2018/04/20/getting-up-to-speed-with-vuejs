<p>One of my <a href="https://www.raymondcamden.com/2017/12/26/my-2017-and-my-plans-for-2018/">goals for 2018</a> was to become an &quot;expert on Vue&quot;. While I think I'm years away from considering myself an expert, I've spent a lot of time digging into it and trying to become better skilled with it, and all the various things in the &quot;Vue ecosphere&quot; like Vuex, Veutify, and more. I'm happy to announce that this May, I'll be giving a three hour course on learning Vue.js:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/live-training/courses/getting-up-to-speed-with-vue-js/0636920179542/">Getting Up to Speed with Vue.js</a></p>
<p>This is an online course that covers everything from Vue basics to working with routing and the store. I really think it will be a great way to get introduced to Vue, see how it works, and start building applications right away. There will be a second class given in June but I don't yet see a way to register for that. (It's June 22nd so they may be waiting for the May class to end before opening up registration for the second.)</p>
