<h1>Post</h1>

<p>First off - my apologies for being a bit quiet here. I had two trips in a row, some big things (good things) happening at work, and some projects that aren't necessarily blog worthy yet, but hopefully I'll have some cool stuff to share soon.</p>
<p>With that out of the way, I'm happy to announce I'll be speaking at another <a href="https://certifiedfreshevents.com/">Certified Fresh</a> event next month, <a href="https://certifiedfreshevents.com/events/jamstack/">&quot;Modern Web Development with the JAMStack&quot;</a>. This is a free online event on May 23rd at noon CST.</p>
<p>No idea what the JAMStack is? Well obviously it's this:</p>

<p>Heh, if only. Imagine static site generators - but taken to the next level. Attend the free online session to get a much better introduction to the topic. I'll be speaking with Phil Hawksworth of Netlify (the fine folks who host this site) and covering some of the ways you can &quot;bring dynamic back&quot; to a static site. I hope to see you there!</p>
