<h1>Post</h1>

<p>So as I announced back in <a href="https://www.raymondcamden.com/2018/04/20/getting-up-to-speed-with-vuejs">April</a>, I'm giving an online course on Vue.js. The May course was cancelled but the June one for the 22nd is still on.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/live-training/courses/getting-up-to-speed-with-vue-js/0636920182153/">Getting Up to Speed with Vue.js</a></p>
