<p>A few months ago I <a href="https://www.raymondcamden.com/2018/06/04/an-update">posted</a> about the loss of my wife. I thought I'd give folks an update and share some good news.</p>
<p>The last few months have been extremely difficult, but I am making progress. Thanks to the help of family and friends, I've been able to go from &quot;going through the motions enough for the kids&quot; to &quot;starting a new life&quot;. Early on I decided to see a therapist and that has been - easily - the best decision I've made in a long time. If you are going through any kind of grief, or other mental issue, I cannot recommend therapy enough. It isn't the type of thing where you go to a few sessions and are &quot;cured&quot;, but rather, my therapist helped me come to terms with my feelings and - most importantly - provided some direction and tools for me to move forward. I have to that on my own but just having a path forward is so damn critical.</p>
<p>My kids are happy and healthy - I've got my workspace back (thank God for school and daycare) - and in general I'm in a good place now. Not great, but good, and one thing I've learned to appreciate is just how damn good that can be.</p>
<p>After some long thought, and talks with my therapist, I've decided that I'm going to return to travel. Not as much as I had before, but I'm going to give it a shot and see how well it works. I've got a great nanny (my niece) and my kids are in a good routine, so I feel like this is the right decision. I love speaking. I mean, I'm actually pretty darn shy and if you've spoken to me at a conference you know this. But I launched this blog years ago as a way to help others and I love sharing knowledge (and learning from others) at conferences.</p>
<p>And.....</p>

<p>I'm happy to say I've got not one but <em>two</em> upcoming <a href="/speaking">speaking enagements</a> coming up. I'll be speaking at a joint meetup between the Google Developer Group and Women Techmakers in Atlanta in October - <a href="https://www.meetup.com/gdg-atlanta/events/254160519">&quot;An Introduction to Webtask&quot;</a>. I'll then be speaking at <a href="http://connect.tech/">Connect.Tech</a> on PWAs (Progressive Web Apps). I am <em>beyond</em> excited to be able to do this and I hope it works out well.</p>
<p>Speaking of helping out - as you can tell my blogging has slowed down quite a bit. Frankly it's a bit difficult with my schedule these days, but I'm slowly adjusting and finding my creativity slowly returning so I hope to see an upswing in posts here.</p>
