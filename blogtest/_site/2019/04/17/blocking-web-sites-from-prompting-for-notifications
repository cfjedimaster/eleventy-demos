<h1>Post</h1>

<p>In general, I'm a fan of new capabilities that come to the web platform. Unfortunately, sometimes a new feature is released that is abused as hell by web sites making you wish the feature had never even been considered. In this case, I don't necessarily blame web developers, as I think they already know that a particular feature is being abused, but rather managers who insist that they know what they're doing and &quot;users really want this&quot;.</p>
<p>And hell, I'm old and cranky so maybe I'm just in the minority. If you are too, then this post is for you.</p>
<p>Have you noticed that nearly every damn site you go to prompts you to enable notifications?</p>

<p style="text-align:center;font-size:12px"><i>Image from <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/push-notifications-firefox">Mozilla.org</a></i></p>
<p>This is part of the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Push_API">Push API</a> which in itself is a good idea, but apparently 90% of the internet decided that on your very first visit to their web page they were going to prompt you to enable notifications.</p>
<p>This is basically the same as meeting someone for the first time and them asking if they can bring a few things over to put in your bathroom for when they spend the night.</p>
<p>I wouldn't mind this so much if it wasn't so obtrusive. You could wait till the person has visited a few times, or include UI in the header/footer some place where the user could click to initiate the process. That's never going to happen. Luckily you can disable it.</p>
<p>Thanks go to <a href="https://dancallahan.info/">Dan Callahan</a> of the Mozilla organization for sharing the following two links.</p>
<p>First, here is how you disable it in Firefox: <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/push-notifications-firefox#w_how-do-i-stop-firefox-asking-me-to-allow-notifications">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/push-notifications-firefox#w_how-do-i-stop-firefox-asking-me-to-allow-notifications</a></p>
<p>While you should follow that link in case it changes, the gist is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click <code>Options</code> from the menu button.</li>
<li>Select <code>Privacy &amp; Security</code> and scroll to permissions.</li>
<li>Click <code>Settings</code> next to Notifications</li>
<li>Click the checkbox on <code>Block new requests to allow notifications</code></li>
</ul>
<p>This is the <em>global</em> block and Firefox does allow site by site settings.</p>
<p>As an aside, Firefox considers this notification spam an issue too and is taking steps to reduce it: <a href="https://blog.nightly.mozilla.org/2019/04/01/reducing-notification-permission-prompt-spam-in-firefox/">Reducing Notification Permission Prompt Spam in Firefox</a></p>
<p>And here is how you do it in Chrome: <a href="https://www.ghacks.net/2016/02/19/disable-show-notifications-prompts-in-google-chrome/">https://www.ghacks.net/2016/02/19/disable-show-notifications-prompts-in-google-chrome/</a></p>
<p>As I said with the Firefox link, you should hit the above URL in case it changes, but the process is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to <code>chrome://settings/content</code>.</li>
<li>Click <code>Notifications</code></li>
<li>And then toggle the top setting from <code>Ask before sending</code> to <code>Blocked</code>. Chrome wants you to think <code>Ask</code> is recommended. Screw that.</li>
</ul>
<p>And finally, believe it or not Safari also supports Web Push. While I couldn't find a URL to share, you can go to <code>Preferences</code>, then <code>Websites</code>, and click on <code>Notifications</code>. They also allow a global &quot;Leave me the frack alone&quot; setting:</p>

<p>That's it. I hope this helps!</p>
