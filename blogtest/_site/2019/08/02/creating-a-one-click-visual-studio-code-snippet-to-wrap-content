<p>Here's a quick tip for you regarding Visual Studio Code <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets">snippets</a>. If you aren't aware, snippets let you define keyword shortcuts for quickly entering content into your code. I've got a bunch tailored for my blogging. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">&quot;uns&quot;:{
	&quot;scope&quot;:&quot;markdown&quot;,
	&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;uns&quot;,
	&quot;body&quot;:[
		&quot;&lt;i&gt;Header photo by &lt;a href=\&quot;$1\&quot;&gt;$2&lt;/a&gt; on Unsplash&lt;/i&gt;&quot;
	],
	&quot;description&quot;: &quot;Unsplash credit&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<p>This is the snippet I use for my <a href="https://unsplash.com/">Unsplash</a> credit text on most of my blog entries. Unsplash has <em>amazing</em> art you can use for free. They ask that you credit them and I figure it's the least I can do, however their &quot;Copy&quot; button only copies the text of the credit, not the link:</p>

<p>I built a snippet so I could quickly insert proper text and then copy in the URL manually. I then type in the image author's name.</p>
<p>Another one I use is for my images. I keep all of my images on Amazon S3. This snippet not only outputs the right base URL, but also outputs a dynamic year and month, matching the organization rules I use.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">&quot;img&quot;: {
	&quot;prefix&quot;: &quot;img&quot;,
	&quot;body&quot;: [
		&quot;&lt;img src=\&quot;https://static.raymondcamden.com/images/$CURRENT_YEAR/$CURRENT_MONTH/$1\&quot; alt=\&quot;\&quot; class=\&quot;imgborder imgcenter\&quot;&gt;&quot;
	],
	&quot;description&quot;: &quot;Used for images&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Ok, so with that in mind, I realized yesterday I needed a new snippet for a very specific use case. I use Jekyll for my static site generator. I also write about Vue.js a lot. It just so happens that both Jekyll and Vue use the same tokens to reference variables - double brackets. So for example: <code>{{ name }}</code>. When I write a blog post with Vue code in it, Jekyll picks up on the variables and tries to render the values, which typically just results in white space.</p>
<p>Luckily there is an easy fix, wrap the content with <code>{% raw %}</code> and <code>{% endraw %}</code>. (And to get <em>that</em> text to render was messy!) I wanted to see if I could build a Visual Studio Code snippet that would let me select some text, hit a key, and then wrap it with the code above. Turns out it took a few steps.</p>
<p>First, I defined my snippet:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">&quot;raw&quot;: {
	&quot;scope&quot;: &quot;markdown&quot;,
	&quot;prefix&quot;: &quot;raw&quot;,
	&quot;body&quot;: [
		&quot;{% raw %}$TM_SELECTED_TEXT{% endraw %}&quot;
	],
	&quot;description&quot;: &quot;Escape Vue&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<p>I use the special variable <code>$TM_SELECTED_TEXT</code> to represent the currently selected text. This works well, but I usually activated snippets by typing their prefix and hitting the space bar. That won't work with selected text.</p>
<p>Luckily there's a F1 command you can run that lets you select a snippet and execute it:</p>
<img src="https://static.raymondcamden.com/images/2019/08/vs2.png" alt="Using the Insert Snippet command." class="imgborder imgcenter">
<p>That works, but requires about 3 clicks. What I wanted to do was simply have a keyboard shortcut that would do the same. Luckily that's <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings">supported</a> as well. I opened my <code>keybindings.json</code> and added:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">{
  &quot;key&quot;: &quot;ctrl+r&quot;,
  &quot;command&quot;: &quot;editor.action.insertSnippet&quot;,
  &quot;when&quot;: &quot;editorHasSelection&quot;,
  &quot;args&quot;: {
    &quot;langId&quot;: &quot;markdown&quot;,
    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;raw&quot;
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>I specified the language and name of my snippet and also set that it only works when I've got an active selection. Now I just select some Vue code, hit <code>ctrl+r</code>, and I'm good to go.</p>
