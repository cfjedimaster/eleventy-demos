<p>For the past year (ok, nearly a year), I've worked as a Developer Experience engineer at American Express. My work there had me interfacing with product owners to help them present the best developer experience possible. This involved everything from simple documentation improvements to helping work on tools to improve developer facing APIs. While I worked with some great people, the role wasn't a great fit for me. Also, I've had some changes at home (good changes!) that will allow me to have a more public facing role, to spend more time on the road, and generally do what I love - help others.</p>
<p>Starting on Monday, I'll be a Lead Developer Evangelist for <a href="https://www.here.com/">HERE</a>. HERE works with location services, think mapping, routing, and related technologies. I'll be blogging, making videos, presentations, and so forth. I'll also be looking at our documentation and working to make things better and easier for developers. As a reminder, if you want to see where I'm speaking next, you can view my <a href="/speaking">speaking</a> page and if you would like me to present to your group, just <a href="/contact">drop me a line</a>. I'm really excited about this new phase and I can't wait to share more with you!</p>
