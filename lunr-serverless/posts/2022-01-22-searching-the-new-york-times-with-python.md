description: Using the New York Times API with Python - some simple demos
---

In my effort to keep practicing Python and build fun stuff to help me learn, today I built a few demos of using the [New York Times API](https://developer.nytimes.com/). I last played with this *way* back in 2014: ["Using the New York Times API to Chart Occurrences in Headlines"](https://www.raymondcamden.com/2014/09/15/using-the-new-york-times-api-to-chart-occurrences-in-headlines). In that demo I let you enter a simple search term and then I report on the number of occurrences of that term over time. I think my favorite image from that post is a search for "Internet":

Today the API popped up back in my head and I thought it would be fun to play with it again, this time in Python. I had some success with it today and thought I'd share the results. It's nothing too exciting and is basic Python stuff, but I love getting the practice and I did learn a bit, so that's always a good use of my time, especially on a Saturday, right?

Note that the [New York Times API](https://developer.nytimes.com/) is free. You can sign up and get a key in seconds. Oddly, they don't link to their [FAQ](https://developer.nytimes.com/faq) which includes important information about their rate limiting. (Spoiler - I hit it.) Definitely reference that before you go live with any real code. 

My first demo makes use of the general [Archive API](https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/archive-product/1/overview). My intent was to return a random article for a day in history. Here's that script.

```python
import requests 
from datetime import datetime 
import random 

year = 1964
month = 1
day = 9
api = f"https://api.nytimes.com/svc/archive/v1/{year}/{month}.json?api-key=myKeyBringsTheBoystoTheYard"

def filter_by_day(list, day):
	result = []
	for article in list:
		d = datetime.strptime(article["pub_date"], "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z")
		if d.day == day:
			result.append(article)
	return result

response = requests.get(api)
data = response.json()
articles = data["response"]["docs"]

# First, get by day
articles = filter_by_day(articles, day)

print("Total",data["response"]["meta"]["hits"])
print("Total for today", len(articles))

selected = random.choice(articles)
print(selected["headline"]["main"])
```

The day, month, and year, are all hard coded here. The Archive API lets you filter by year and month, not day, so first I get all the articles for a month and then I filter it down to ones that match the target date. Dates are still pretty hard for me in Python. I used `strptime` to get the day value out of the resutls from the API and had to build the match by hand. I wonder if Python has a way to make that simpler - like - look at the string and take a guess? 

Anyway, once I've filtered to articles for a day, I then `random.choice` to pick one. I then print out the headline. I ran this a few times and here's the output:

</p>

For my second iteration, I simply removed the hard coded year, month, and day. This gave me a bit more practice with Python date support. You can see that in the top portion of the code below. 

```python
import requests 
from datetime import datetime 
from datetime import date
import calendar

import random 
import sys

KEY = "damnRightItsBetterThanYours"

# earliest year supported by NYT API
NYT_MIN_YEAR = 1851

lastYear = (date.today()).year-1
year = random.randint(NYT_MIN_YEAR, lastYear)
print("Select year", year)

month = random.randint(1,12)
print("Select month", month)

daysInMonth = calendar.monthrange(year,month)[1]
day = random.randint(1, daysInMonth)
print("Selected day", day)


api = f"https://api.nytimes.com/svc/archive/v1/{year}/{month}.json?api-key={KEY}"

def filter_by_day(list, day):
	result = []
	for article in list:
		d = datetime.strptime(article["pub_date"], "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z")
		if d.day == day:
			result.append(article)
	return result

response = requests.get(api)
data = response.json()
articles = data["response"]["docs"]

# First, get by day
articles = filter_by_day(articles, day)

print("Total",data["response"]["meta"]["hits"])
print("Total for today", len(articles))

selected = random.choice(articles)
print(selected["headline"]["main"])
```

Getting a random year and month was easy thanks to Python's `random` library. Figuring out the total number of days in the month was a bit harder, and by that I mean I had to google for it. The `calendar` module provides a simple API for it. I'll be honest - in the past I've been lazy with code like this and simply used 28 as a max day. Don't tell my employers. After that, it's pretty much the same code as before. Get by year/month, filter to day, and select one.

For my final demo, I decided to rebuild the logic I first did nearly ten years ago. Given a term, report on the number of occurrences in headlines over time. Not surprisingly, this is where I first hit the API limits. Thankfully Python has a `sleep` module to make it easy to 'slow' down my code. I also put a limit of 100 years into the code to make it a bit more reasonable. Here's my little command line utility:

```python
#!/usr/bin/python

"""
Given a term X, search for it over years from MIN to now

FYI - the NYT API FAQ: https://developer.nytimes.com/faq

"""
from datetime import date
import requests
import time 
import sys

KEY = "still kinda secret"

# earliest year supported by NYT API
NYT_MIN_YEAR = 1851

# now 
YEAR = (date.today()).year 

# But to keep things rational, maybe just do 100 years
MIN_YEAR = YEAR - 100

# Given a term, I return the total in a year
def countForTerm(term,year):
	# Note, we filter to one key cuz we only really care about the count
	api = f"https://api.nytimes.com/svc/search/v2/articlesearch.json?&api-key={KEY}&fl=web_url"
	# pass term here, requests will url encode
	response = requests.get(api, params=[("fq",f"pub_year:{year} AND headline:{term}")])
	data = response.json()

	if "fault" in data:
		print("ERROR:",data["fault"]["faultstring"])
		sys.exit()

	total = data["response"]["meta"]["hits"]

	return total

def main(term):
	# it's an array, but reduce to a string
	term = " ".join(term)
	print(f"Searching for {term} from {MIN_YEAR} to {YEAR}")
	for year in range(MIN_YEAR, YEAR):
		total = countForTerm(term, year)
		print(year,total)
		time.sleep(6)

if len(sys.argv) == 1:
	print("Usage: nyt3.py termToSearchFor")
	sys.exit()

if __name__ == "__main__":
   main(sys.argv[1:])
```

As you can see, this script is meant to be run from the command like per the usage instructions printed if you don't pass an argument. Instead of a fancy graph (which I know Python can do, I'm not quite there yet), I simply output to the terminal. I also discovered that the `requests` library can handle URL encoding for you. I do that in the second argument to the `get` call. Also note I'm filtering the results to one key, `web_url`, because I don't actually care about the matches, just the count. I ran a test on this on "iraq war" and here's the result. I'm sharing this as text and not a graphic as it's quite big:

All in all, fun and fascinating! I've got some ideas on another demo with this but will call it quits for today. Let me know what you think.
