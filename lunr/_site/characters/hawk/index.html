<p>Hawk comes from a rich family who could afford to get their son into West Point. He didn't disappoint them. He graduated with top honors, became an officer, and went on to receive Advanced Infantry Training (AIT) and attend Air Defense Artillery School and Covert Ops School. Military education is not all that he got; he served as a cadre on the North Atlantic Range Command and then the USA ENG COM EVR.</p>
<p>However, he received the brunt of his field experience in Iran and Central America when serving in a special forces unit as Forward Observer (FO) mainly engaged in LIC/COIN ops.[1] And that's why those under his command respect him: they know he's gone and done it just as they have. There's not a thing they wouldn't do for him. As they say, he would never give his soldiers a command that he wouldn't do by himself.</p>
