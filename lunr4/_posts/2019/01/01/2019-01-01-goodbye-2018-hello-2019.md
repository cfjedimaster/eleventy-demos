For years now I've done a few posts towards the end of the year as a way to recap. I'd typically cover my "favorite media" (books, movies, etc.) and then talk about myself and what I accomplished and hoped to accomplish for the next year. 

I'm bucking the trend this year because, well, things are radically different than they were last year at this time. If you have not already read my [news](https://www.raymondcamden.com/2018/06/04/an-update) or seen my [update](https://www.raymondcamden.com/2018/08/29/an-update), I'll summarize by saying that over the past year I lost both a wife and a job. Stressful does not even begin to describe it. 

I'm starting 2019 in a better place, with "better" being extremely relative. The holidays are done (and frankly I'm happy for that). I've got a [job](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raymondcamden/). I've got my health (approaching 30 pounds lost since August). I'm going to do my best to take care of myself and my kids while trying to enjoy life as much as possible.

Typically I spend some time talking about my plans for the new year, focusing on professional stuff. Not this year. I absolutely have "plans" - try to kick butt at my new job, become better at Vue - but I've decided to set my "resolutions" to things that are 100% focused on my mental health and happiness. 

My blogging activity has steadily declined over the past few years (if you're truly curious, you can check the [stats](/stats)) but I've been writing elsewhere as well. That will probably continue for 2019. I love my readers, and as always, hope you will comment, make suggestions, etc., and thank you for the time you spent here last year. 

Onward and upward, right?

p.s. Ok, so I can't leave without at least a *quick* media review. "Solo" was a really good Star Wars movie. Not great, but enjoyable as heck, ignore the reviews. "Spider-Man" for the PS4 was easily the best video game of the year, and "Into the Spider-Verse" was easily my favorite movie. Finally, if you like music (and of course you do), consider signing up for [CodaBreaker](https://remotesynthesis.us6.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=231f8aff82a1f82e4d6ab23d8&id=d00ad8719a), a bi-monthly-ish music newsletter set up by [Brian Rinaldi](https://twitter.com/remotesynth) and myself as a way to share cool/interesting/new music picks.
