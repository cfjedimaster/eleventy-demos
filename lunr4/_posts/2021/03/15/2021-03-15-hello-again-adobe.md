description: My new role at Adobe.
---

A few days ago I [shared](https://www.raymondcamden.com/2021/03/05/saying-goodbye-to-here) that I was leaving HERE Technologies and starting a new role. Today I'm doing something new - returning to a company I've worked at before. Today I'm starting a new role as a Senior Developer Evangelist for Adobe, focusing on the [document services APIs](https://www.adobe.io/apis/documentcloud/dcsdk/) that you may have noticed me blogging about the last few weeks.

This new opportunity really came out of nowhere. I didn't even know they were hiring. I caught up with an old friend, discovered what she was doing, and when I saw what they were working on (and that they were hiring), I thought it would be a great fit. 

I first got introduced to the power of PDFs when I worked with ColdFusion. Maybe ten or so years ago, the ColdFusion team added in basic support for PDF manipulation and inspection by integrating a version of LiveCycle. Honestly back then PDFs didn't really interest me, but I typically tried to test every aspect of a new version of ColdFusion. I started playing with the integration, and it just really struck a chord with me. I also started paying more attention to the PDF space in general, the capabilities, and more. 

When I saw what the document services teams we're working on (the client-side library, the APIs, and more), and started playing with them myself, I got pretty excited, and I'm thrilled to be able to join this team and help introduce the tools to everyone. 

I'll still be blogging about Jamstack, Vue, JavaScript, development, and of course, cats, so please wish me good luck as I start my (second) first day at Adobe!
