This post is really just for those folks who attended my [DevNexus](https://devnexus.com/) presentations this past week, although anyone is welcome to grab the assets if you want. I've zipped
up both slide decks and demos. I've gone back and forth between putting presentations up on GitHub and if I give these again they move there, but for now you can just grab the zips.

In both sessions I mentioned the "Awesome Vue" resource, a list of, well awesome Vue.js related stuff. You can find that here: <https://github.com/vuejs/awesome-vue>.

Thank you to everyone who showed up!
