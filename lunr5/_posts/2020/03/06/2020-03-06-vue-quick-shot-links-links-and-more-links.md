description: A list of resources for Vue developers
---

Welcome to the final entry in my Vue Quick Shot series. I'll share all the links at the end of this post. I hope this week's series has been helpful and if you enjoyed it, please drop me a comment and I'll definitely consider doing another series in the future. For my fifth and final Vue Quick Shot, I'm not going to write a line of code. Instead I'm going to share links to resources that have helped me learn Vue and become a better developer. This is not meant to be an exhaustive list of everything out there for Vue, but rather a more focused list on things that helped me personally.

<p/>

* [The Docs](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/) - It should come as no surprise that the core docs are where any new developer should start. I'd only point out that you shouldn't miss the excellent [Cookbook](https://vuejs.org/v2/cookbook/) as well. I didn't notice it for months. 
* [Vue Forum](https://forum.vuejs.org/) - The official Vue forum. Pretty heavily used and you typically get an answer to anything relatively soon. There's also a pretty busy [Stackoverflow tag](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vue.js) for Vue.
* [Amazing Vue](https://github.com/vuejs/awesome-vue) - A huge list of cool things done in Vue. Basically if you need X for Vue, check here first.
* [Sarah Drasner on CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/intro-to-vue-1-rendering-directives-events/) - Part one of a five part series on Vue. It's especially good in the animations area, a part of Vue I've never played with.
* [Devtools Extension](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-devtools) - The devtools extension is nice, and supported in most browsers, but may be more useful to people using Vuex. Honestly unless I'm using Vuex, I just use console messages.
* Newsletters - You can, and should, sign up for both the [official newsletter](https://news.vuejs.org) and the 
[Vue.js Developers](https://vuejsdevelopers.com/newsletter/) newsletter. For those of us who can't spend all day glued to Twitter, this is the best way to get the news about what's going on with Vue.
* And finally, I've got nearly 100 posts [tagged with Vue](https://www.raymondcamden.com/tags/vuejs) and at least a few of them are worth your time. I also write about Vue from time to time for other publications and I keep a list of them on my [About](https://www.raymondcamden.com/about/) page. 

That's it! I hope these small nuggets have been helpful to you this week, and as I said, leave me a comment below with your thoughts!
