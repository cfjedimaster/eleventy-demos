When I don't blog on a regular cadence (once a week), I start to whig out a bit, and despite the absolute huge amount of content here (notice I didn't say *good* content), I begin to stress out when I don't meet that self-imposed schedule. On a whim, I decided to work on something that's been in my queue for a while but realized that in order for *that* post to be done, I needed some recent content on the blog. 

With that in mind, I'm writing this post just to add some filler content to my blog. I feel bad about that, as I want folks to always get value from my site, but at the same time, since it is my site I'm allowed. ;)

So as to make this more worthwhile, here's some things for you to consider:

### Read Adam Cameron's Blog

Adam Cameron is an old friend of mine from the ColdFusion community and is an altogether smart and straightforward guy. He doesn't pull punches with his opinions, but he's scary smart and worth a read. You can find his blog at <https://blog.adamcameron.me> and follow him at [@adam_cameron](https://twitter.com/adam_cameron).

### Checkout my work for Adobe

If you don't follow me on Twitter (I understand), then you may be missing my blog posts over on our Medium site: <https://medium.com/adobetech>. Not just my content, which is a small part, but a huge amount of great technical content from Adobe. Returning here has been eye opening in terms of how much developer stuff is going on with Adobe. Also, I was able to get the jedimaster email address at adobe.com (jedimaster@adobe.com), so I'm never leaving this job.

### Learn Python

Finally, late last year I started to learn Python. Unfortunately, with the job search and the new job keeping me busy, my time to *continue* my learning has come to a stop. My plan is to try real hard to get back on track in May. That being said, I *really* like the book that I ended up with. If you pick it up via the link below, I'll earn a few pennies, so consider picking it up if you've been meaning to learn. As I said, I really like it and it's working great for me (well, when I had time for it).
