description: Announcing the final release of the Jamstack book!
---

As the title says, I'm *incredibly* happy to announce the final release of [The Jamstack Book](https://www.manning.com/books/the-jamstack-book):

</p>

This book was written by both [Brian Rinaldi](https://remotesynthesis.com/) and myself and covers the basics of what the Jamstack is, demonstrates multiple examples, and goes into topics like using a CMS and serverless. 

Now, to be technical, the PDF is available right now. If you want a mobile/Kindle version or dead tree, you have to wait a few more weeks. (And honestly, I understand that - I prefer physical books for technical topics.) But you can still order now if you want, and remember, every book you buy helps me feed my eight kids, three cats, and dog. (Yes, I'm laying down a guilt trip. Is it working?)
