description: A few links for your Sunday...
---

Happy Sunday and Happy Mother's Day. Here are three things I want to share for today. As always, the idea is to help share resources with those of you lucky enough to avoid Twitter and to help/inspire/challenge you. Enjoy!

The first thing I want to share is something I've been mentioning over the past few years. An excellent way to keep up on what's going on is to sign up for one of the various newsletters run by [Cooper Press](https://cooperpress.com/). Begin by perusing their [full list](https://cooperpress.com/publications/) of *free* newsletters and I'll specifically call out a few I think are awesome:

* [JavaScript Weekly](https://javascriptweekly.com/)
* [Frontend Focus](https://frontendfoc.us/)
* [JAMStacked](https://jamstack.email/)

Again, all of these are free. Best of all - you get a weekly newsletter of stuff and can just sit on it if you're busy. 

The second link I'll share is to Dr. Axel Rauschmayer's excellent [2ality](https://2ality.com/index.html). His article on the [triple dot syntax](https://2ality.com/2022/05/rest-vs-spread.html) was shared in JavaScript Weekly last week and was an excellent reminder of what an incredible resource his site is. Dr. Rauschmayer goes *very* deep into JavaScript topics and I have to honestly say I don't always understand him, but that's my fault, not his. If you want to get a very detailed look at JavaScript, check out his site. 

Finally, a bit of nontech and tech. Last night I saw "Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness". I went with my wife, one of my sons, one of my daughters, and my brother-in-law. I loved it. My daughter loved it. The other three were more "so so" on it. That being said, if you're a parent, you should really consider it R-rated, not PG-13. Some of the horror is surprising at times. It didn't bother me but it absolutely surprised me.

I'll share that one of my most favorite creations ever is the [@randomcomicbook](https://twitter.com/randomcomicbook) Twitter bot. It uses the Marvel API to share random comic covers from the history of Marvel's publications. I love the variety of art styles and seeing just how *old* some of their content is.
