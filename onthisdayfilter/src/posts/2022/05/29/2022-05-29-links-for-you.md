description: A few links for your Sunday...

A few quick links here to end May. This week has been incredibly difficult for many people, myself included. Please remember that therapy can be life saving, it was for me. If you need help, please sure to reach out and get support. Your mental health is just as important as your physical health.

## MySQL developers rejoice!

For my first link, I want to share a cool Visual Studio Code extension my buddy [Scott Stroz](https://scottstroz.com/) shared, the [MySQL Shell for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Oracle.mysql-shell-for-vs-code). This is a *dang* well done extension for folks who use MySQL. Even better, it's done in a notebook interface which is something I've only really started using since I began playing with Python. To give you an idea of how it looks, I'm going to steal one of their graphics:

Slick, right? Oracle has been doing some cool stuff lately and I've been meaning to dig into their stack more for quite some time now. 

## Outside articles

I keep track of my "external" writing on my [About](https://www.raymondcamden.com/about/) page, but I realized these blog posts would be a great way to let my subscribers know of recent articles. I write for a few different places, but most recently I've done some posts for [Verpex](https://verpex.com/). In particular, here are my recent articles there:

* <a href="https://verpex.com/blog/website-tips/top-six-things-to-avoid-in-your-website">Top Six Things to Avoid in Your Website</a>
* <a href="https://verpex.com/blog/website-tips/exploring-alternatives-to-google-analytics">Exploring Alternatives to Google Analytics</a>
* <a href="https://verpex.com/blog/website-tips/jamstack-vs-wordpress-my-journey">Jamstack vs. WordPress: My Journey</a>

I've also written for [Serialized](https://serialized.io):

## Eleventy update

And lastly, here's the most recent update from Eleventy:

As always, cool stuff, and I'm so incredibly happy I've built my site on it!
